rss feed
Pattern(s): 3	
as there are quite a few deprecated versions of rss you might conceivably have to support rss feed that vary quite a bit in their formatting details
rss does not have a registered media content type



30195
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
mine does include hidden folder while zipping though i do have show hidden files enabled
it looks like the compressed folder shell extension ignores directory but not files whose names begin with a dot unless explicitly given as a parameter selected for the send to command



34338
phpunit simpletest
Pattern(s): 3	
as far as i know phpunit does not include a html gui but there are gui s available to download such as cool
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up



47710
nullpointerexception illegalargumentexception
Pattern(s): 1	
you should be using illegalargumentexception iae not nullpointerexception nullpointerexception for the following reasons
first the nullpointerexception javadoc explicitly lists the cases where nullpointerexception is appropriate



60119
cassini iis
Pattern(s): 2	
cassini does not support https
however you can use iis to do this if your using iis 5.1 download the ms iis toolpack for iis 6.0 it comes with a tool to create self signed ssl certificates



70627
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 1	
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort
mergesort is worth considering if speed is of the essence bad worst-case performance cannot be tolerated and extra space is available



76040
xna slimdx
Pattern(s): 1	
xna isn t the only alternative though
there is also slimdx which is under constant development as a means of providing a lean wrapper of directx in a similar fashion as managed directx which was i believe discontinued by microsoft in favor of xna



78627
strtol atof
Pattern(s): 1	
use strtol strtoll not atoi to check int
use strtof strtod not atof to check double



78627
atof strtod
Pattern(s): 1	
use strtof strtod not atof to check doubles
atoi and atof convert the initial part of the string but don t tell you whether or not they used all of the string



79901
strace systemtap
Pattern(s): 5	
some applications can trick strace ptrace not to run so the only real option i ve had is using systemtap
systemtap can intercept a bunch of system calls if need be due to its wild card matching



102176
cvs svn
Pattern(s): 5	
in cvs this was called a tag
svn doesn t use a separate mechanism for tags it just creates a branch



109038
cairngorm puremvc
Pattern(s): 1	
puremvc is anti-flex cairngorm just doesn t use many of the good parts of flex
by this i mean that puremvc reinvents many things that flex already have because it wants to be platform agnostic and because of its architecture specifically the mediators it makes it harder to use bindings to their full power



109038
cairngorm puremvc
Pattern(s): 5	
in short cairngorm is the visualbasic of flex it works but will teach you a lot of bad habits
puremvc isn t so bad it just isn t a very good fit for writing flex applications



125045
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
step 2 create trunk branches and tags folder - commit step 3 copy hook scripts to new repository
one of my hook scripts is to make sure that the items in the tags directory cannot be modified



137954
ubuntu opensuse
Pattern(s): 5	
ubuntu will not hurt since they have a relationship with sun but since jboss has become part of redhat i would think that redhat-based distros should be pretty good
i ve used redhat fedora and opensuse to run banking production apps and they are pretty good



154976
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 1	
also use the correct gcc frontend executable g++ will treat .c files like c++ files unless you explicitly tell it not too
so if you are compiling real c then use gcc not g++



159002
actionscript mxml
Pattern(s): 5	
so yes everything that can be done with mxml can be done with actionscript but not the other way around
mxml compiles to action script so it s really like a higher level version of that



167681
trac bugzilla
Pattern(s): 5	
of course trac doesn t have support for blocking blockedby tickets out of the box so if you want to import this data too you ll have to use the masterticketsplugin and then modify the script yourself which is what we did when we migrated
for bugzilla trac has a script bugzilla2trac.py that will automate the process of importing bugzilla bugs to trac tickets for you



169629
strdup strtok
Pattern(s): 5	
use strdup to copy the string
strtok does not give you a new string



177557
qdialog qobject
Pattern(s): 5	
your dialog derives from more than one class and qdialog is not the first class that it derives from
for qmake to work correctly the qobject derived base class needs to be the first class that is inherited from



178178
qspinbox qpalette
Pattern(s): 5	
i haven t specifically tried for a qspinbox but i guess it ll work the same
using a qpalette isn t guaranteed to work for all styles because style authors are restricted by the different platforms guidelines and by the native theme engine



226519
division multiplication
Pattern(s): 3	
division isn t going to have a big performance impact in your application
floating-point division is generally especially slow so while floating-point multiplication is also relatively slow it s probably faster than floating-point division



232602
ienumerable ienumerator
Pattern(s): 1	
ienumerable t doesn t inherit idisposable
ienumerator t does inherit idisposable however whereas the non-generic ienumerator doesn t



234731
snmp mib
Pattern(s): 3	
snmp isn t bad but it may not be able to do everything you need it to do
depending on the library you use and how it hides the details of interacting with snmp you may have a hard time finding the correct parts of the mib to change and even knowing what or how to change them to do what you want



236111
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
on linux with glibc the memory is actually always returned to the os above a certain size glibc malloc uses mmap for big allocations controlled by mmap_threshold and in that case free calls munmap which frees automatically the reserved memory
below that threshold it uses brk and free does not return the memory in that case



256398
textmate aptana
Pattern(s): 3	
if you want something more minimalistic there is e text editor which supports textmate bundles not free though
i ve been using aptana it s quite good with lots of features even in the free version you probably don t need pro



261277
boost stl
Pattern(s): 5	
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out
boost has a utility called next and its inverse prior for just that purpose



277445
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb support transactions whilst myisam does not
innodb supports referential integrity whilst myisam does not



277445
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 3	
innodb supports referential integrity whilst myisam does not
innodb handles indexes a bit differently storing the primary key as part of every index making indexes take up more room on the disk but also making a covering index more likely



281802
cvsnt tortoisecvs
Pattern(s): 5	
whie cvs and cvsnt are very similar cvsnt is not cvs
tortoisecvs add dialog will show the file types as it guesses they are and you can override the filetype there



288860
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
i have a folder not the default sql backup location where transaction logs are deposited from a remote server
i am writing a c# app that loops through that directory and creates a comma delimited string of file names with paths fooa.txn foob.txn fooc.txn



294869
expander tabitem
Pattern(s): 5	
last but not least i was able to get everything working properly with a groupbox and tabitem but not so much luck with an expander and i m not sure why
the expander handles the contentstringformat properly but not the headercontentstringformat



322081
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
the dbkey property getter is virtual in the il because it is in an interface
the setter is not virtual because it is not part of the interface but part of the concrete class



322241
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 2	
udp doesn t provide the safety that tcp does but doesn t require a response but such responses are part of their protocols not yours
i would suggest using tcp to save you some headache



338815
postorder inorder
Pattern(s): 5	
however the other posters are right java doesn t expose any of the tree mechanics so a preorder or postorder isn t possible at this view
you can at least do the inorder walk using the iterator and a for each loop



338821
wordpress joomla
Pattern(s): 3	
wordpress isn t as good as joomla when it comes to user management though
for example joomla can specify exactly what content users and user groups have access to



349805
salt md5
Pattern(s): 1	
the time-based salt will not make md5 any easier to break
you re still relying on 1 the user having a good password to defeat brute force calculations and 2 md5 being a decent hash



350167
gridview repeater
Pattern(s): 1	
if you don t need any of the features of a gridview why not use a repeater
a repeater keeps it simple for implementation but also allows you to have full control over the generated source



355488
jrockit yourkit
Pattern(s): 1	
jrockit might also not support the hprof format at all because it s not required by the java spec
you may want to check yourkit which is the only tool i m aware of that comes close to the eclipse memory analyzer for memory usage analysis



355790
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
well the first thing to say is that if you re calling settimeout but not changing the interval you should be using setinterval
edit update from comment you can keep a reference from the closure if used as a class and setinterval clearinterval don t require re-referencing



357081
printf strncpy
Pattern(s): 3	
what you can do is use printf to write to a temporary string and then something like strncpy to copy only the bytes that you want
there is no way to tell printf not to write a trailing null



367303
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 1	
but it is up to the compiler if the method is actually inline or not
the compiler inlining is sophisticated enough to only in-line if this will help in the optimization stratergy being used



377309
ninject linfu
Pattern(s): 5	
it s one of the most flexible ioc containers out there and like ninject there s no xml file to maintain
unlike ninject however linfu doesn t force you to write any binding code to wire up your dependencies together



388090
memcpy memmove
Pattern(s): 5	
memcpy should have that behavior
memmove doesn t by design if the blocks of memory overlap it copies the contents starting at the ends of the buffers to avoid that sort of behavior



389824
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb enforces foreign key constraints
myisam doesn t enforce or even store foreign key constraints



399039
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql is more oracle-like in syntax and in some of the features indeed it has been occasionally called poor man s oracle
mysql i am not sure what to compare to



408981
pyopengl pyglet
Pattern(s): 1	
pyopengl doesn t even wrap all the functions opengl has
pyglet also has a great library for rendering 2d with hardware acceleration through opengl and it s really well made



416917
boost allocator
Pattern(s): 1	
replacing your containers with boost containers is not a good idea
the work to make appropriate custom allocator wouldn t be that bad but you d be violating the spirit of your allocate at startup rule



419600
gif bmp
Pattern(s): 1	
gif is good for illustrations when you do not wish to move to png
bmp shouldn t be used online within web pages - wastes bandwidth



430261
int boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
basically c has two main simple data types int and floating point numbers though various precisions
everything else boolean enums not simple but it fits etc



435831
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 2	
if costs are a constraint you could try this there is a wizard in visual studio that will attempt to upgrade vb6 to vb.net
it s not 100 accurate and you will have to write code for things vb.net does not support such as control arrays etc



463600
xpand xtend
Pattern(s): 3	
xpand templates are only meant for generating textual artifacts while most logic underlying the generation should be implemented in xtensions
xtend does not have a loop construct either but it s possible to find an alternative if you re willing to follow the functional programming-paradigm



474789
fread calloc
Pattern(s): 5	
also fread will not automatically add the terminator which is why even if your file is way shorter than the maximum length you get garbage
note an alternative method for being lazy is just to use calloc which sets the string to 0



482346
facade mediator
Pattern(s): 1	
this way the facade is not adding functionality it is just delegating to some existing objects
in the other hand the mediator add the new functionality by combining different objects



525745
des aes
Pattern(s): 3	
des is extremely easy to crack nowadays
please use aes or at least 3des if aes is not available



531083
swt swing
Pattern(s): 3	
however there are a few things that swt does that swing doesn t do as well or at all -- such as launch the system s native browser and execute javascript scripts in this browser
if you consider swt consider it carefully



538940
vmware esx
Pattern(s): 1	
vmware server is great i use it for compartamentalizing different projects which require different setups and would recommend it if you require different environment setups and your machine has enough resources
vmware esx is not free thus not for you



538940
vmware esx
Pattern(s): 1	
vmware esx is not free thus not for you
vmware esxi is free but can t run on top of an os installation thus might not be for you



544949
cassini iis
Pattern(s): 1	
if you have doubts if something runs on cassini but not in iis
a dev or local iis is the only solution



551301
vim emacs
Pattern(s): 3	
vim does only text editing and that very well without plugins
its up to you if you like emacs or not



557079
soappy suds
Pattern(s): 5	
soappy has support for attachments on its todo list
suds does not mention the word attachments anywhere



568356
wxhaskell gtk2hs
Pattern(s): 3	
when wxhaskell was first announced at the haskell workshop the development of the native haskell api looked extremely promising but was still incomplete
it looks as if the haskellized api for wxhaskell is still being worked on whereas the gtk2hs project doesn t mention this issue at all



570707
boost stl
Pattern(s): 5	
clarification boost did not boost up my ood skills
stl boost is a tool for the job



586490
pipe freopen
Pattern(s): 1	
you might want to be sure to set up a handler for sigpipe in case your program finds itself on the blocking end of a pipe not fifo pipe
so . your_program --stdout tmp stdout.txt --stderr tmp stderr.txt should be easily accomplished with freopen and keeping the same actual file descriptors



591861
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
so when your mouse moves out of the parent menu item into its children the parent is still considered having the mouse hovered over it
it might help with getting the overall picture to understand why the onmouse out|over events and or the hover class are only applied to the menu items which have children and not the regular menu items



603150
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 1	
if you only installed c compiler you would have command gcc but not command g++
g++ is c++ compiler not c compiler



610260
memcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 3	
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
i d tend to use memcpy if i have already calculated the length although strcpy is usually optimised to work on machine words it feels that you should provide the library with as much information as you can so it can use the most optimal copying mechanism



610260
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 3	
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

610597
gif png
Pattern(s): 1	
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you need to be careful if you forget to convert to palette mode your png image may be saved in 24 bit color which will take more space



610769
gif png
Pattern(s): 1	
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you may run into problems on the web



639452
ubuntu debian
Pattern(s): 1	
unfortunately this ends up causing you a problem because ubuntu adopted all these packages from debian but doesn t support them in the same way as debian does and debian packagers seem to feel put upon to be asked to support these ubuntu users
so ubuntu user goes to main exim list and is told to ask their packager for help



639916
vb6 vba
Pattern(s): 5	
vb6 has the clipboard object that allows you to get the clipboard data in different formats
vba doesn t have this object



661143
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
therefore if you wish to have the compiler access com.stackoverflow.example.class present in the classes directory under project a but not in the build path of project a then you should add classes as a class folder and not classes com stackoverflow as a class folder
you can add a directory containing the class files to the eclipse project only if it is inside one of your eclipse projects either in a generated directory or in one you have created



663290
pycrypto m2crypto
Pattern(s): 5	
m2crypto is built on top of openssl supports mostlyl everything you need is still maintained and up to date while pycrypto issues several deprecation warnings
pycrypto doesn t add the mentioned padding



665042
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql has better foreign key support better referential integrity transactions views subselects etc
but that doesn t mean mysql doesn t have its place



678416
rtl verilog
Pattern(s): 3	
rtl isn t a programming language per se and is generally hardware-neutral assembly is definitely not neutral it s targeted to a specific architecture
vhdl and verilog are most commonly used for programmable logic which i think qualifies as talking straight to the hardware



689320
xna slimdx
Pattern(s): 1	
unfortunately microsoft no longer supports managed directx and it s successor xna does not support 64bit either
slimdx is an open source alternative to managed directx and it supports 64bit



699484
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	
keep in mind that doing this calculation directly affects how much the cpu is in use
cpu usage cannot be directly measured because unlike an x86 the arm processors doesn t have a register for it



710597
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
my superclass does not handle any jaxb annotations it doesn t have to and i would like my subclassing not to include superclass properties while marshalling
adding the xmlaccesortype on superclass cannot be the solution as i have no way to modify the superclass



711712
super self
Pattern(s): 5	
super is the receiver not the parent of its class
just like self is not the receiver s class



716454
webclient httpwebrequest
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are worried though you may want to use webclient which is idisposable
httpwebrequest doesn t implement idisposable since it can create a stream which does implement idisposable



745963
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb is not always so lucky
the myisam can also be backed-up out from under the database



764215
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
an md5 hash is a form of validation
if a single bit in the file is different the provided hash will not match the one generated from the file you downloaded



766633
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
but a for-loop probably isn t what you want
when you use two for loops your inner loops keeps going back to the start every time the outer loops loops



768287
opera safari
Pattern(s): 1	
opera 11.10 has partial support for fileapi
safari - i couldn t find a good official source for this but this site suggests partial support from 5.1 full support for 6.0



778759
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 3	
server-side validation is required simply because client-side validation can be disabled
client-side validation isn t required but it makes your application more responsive during error handling as you no longer need to do a form submit to the server and wait for the resulting page to come back



783534
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 5	
i m unusual in that i come from a c c++ background know c# but actually prefer vb.net i severely dislike vb6 vbscript
i say all this because it s important to remember the vb6 is not vb.net



784578
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
however it is easier to read the input as a string and then convert the input to an int or floating point number afterwards
isdigit c should be called on a chars not an an int



787394
vbscript jscript
Pattern(s): 5	
vbscript has that ability as a global function but other windows script host languages might not
for instance jscript does not have a global createobject function i believe it does however have a syntax so you do not need to use wscript.createobject in jscript either



787579
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
i haven t seen this one per se but i have seen similar problems with large udp datagrams causing ip fragmentation which lead to congestion and ultimately dropped ethernet frames
since this is tcp ip i wouldn t expect ip fragmentation to be a large issue since it is a stream-based protocol



812117
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 2	
this will tell maven to use jfoo 1.0.0 up to jfoo 2.0.0 so when jfoo releases version 1.2.17 you ll be fetching that in the next build assuming your settings are set to check versions each time
this pom.xml doesn t have to actually build anything



827859
haskell sml
Pattern(s): 1	
sml ocaml f# and haskell allow closed sealed algebraic types to be defined to strengthen static typing by conveying more specific constraints implicitly
ocaml and f# also allow open sum types whereas sml does not and haskell requires an elaborate workaround described by oleg kiselyov



842610
interpolation splines
Pattern(s): 1	
finding a local maximum of an interpolation splines is an easy enough thing
note that you should generally use a true splines here not a pchip interpolant



855978
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
it doesn t matter when you digest the salt prefix postfix infix all produce different hash but achieve the same purpose of defeating rainbow tables or other pre-hashed dictionary attacks
i think that the comment has to do specifically with a vulnerability in md5 not hashing in general



857827
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
i assume your select all and deselect all button are using javascript to set or unset all the other checkbox in the form
unset checkbox are not passed on



861775
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 5	
uilabel are not editable however you can detect a touch with a uilabel or it s superview
when you detect the touch on the uilabel you simply restore the hidden uitextview and restore the string you saved



889246
stdout fflush
Pattern(s): 5	
also relating to stdout in addition to flushing output per previous example stdout.flush you can ask ruby to automatically sync writes to an io buffer in this case stdout with associated device writes basically turns off internal buffering
also i find that sometimes fflush doesn t work for me and i use io.fsync instead



894539
opera safari
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome and opera have this feature
ie doesn t apple safari doesn t either



906018
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
please correct me but the test2 for-loop executes only 1 step because of the throwing exception and test1 caught the exception inside loops and is executed 2500000 times
when you catch the exception outside loops loops will not start again



911855
tput tcsh
Pattern(s): 2	
having decided that you are talking to terminal then you can use tput to retrieve the correct escape codes for the particular terminal you are using - this will make the code more portable
an example script in bash i am afraid as tcsh is not my forte is given below



927797
redmine trac
Pattern(s): 1	
i know redmine has an additional feature that checks for these bug numbers in the commit logs and attaches the revision to the bug so you can see from the bug all the revisions that were involved in fixing it
i d be suprised if trac doesn t have something similar



937696
floating-point fractions
Pattern(s): 3	
short answer python uses binary arithmetic for floating-point numbers not decimal arithmetic
decimal fractions are not exactly representable in binary



939691
rss feed
Pattern(s): 3	
rss is there to keep you up to date
if a feed publishes 10 items an hour but only shows five you ll miss five of those items and the feed isn t serving its purpose



939808
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
calloc does set the entire buffer to 0 but i can t imagine it being noticeably faster than malloc+memset
allocating memory via new or malloc does not clear it



945533
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
you have to use an other database like postgresql to get real blob support sorry
i do not know which client api you use but when trying to use blobs from own java and objective-c clients it seems mysql does not really support streaming of blobs



960895
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
your oggplayer is an iplay double not an iplay int
you can t cast an iplay int to an iplay object or an iplay double to an iplay int like that



961939
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
for example if you want to perform all your calculations up front so that you can release a resource then a list comprehension or for-loop is probably best
if you use psyco you ll get a significant speed increase for list expressions and for loops but not for generators



963879
mvp presenter
Pattern(s): 5	
this is a problem because you use mvp for decoupling view and presenter but this design makes them tightly coupled
your presenter does not need to know about your view so you can remove iproducteditorview parameter from the presenter constructor



964014
perforce svn
Pattern(s): 3	
it s been some years since i last time used perforce but i remember it certainly didn t like anyone else messing with its workspaces
svn doesn t like it either



975194
vb6 vba
Pattern(s): 3	
this knowledgebase article explains how to do it from vba it s exactly the same in vb6
the references command is on the project menu in vb6 not the tools menu i think that s the only difference



991635
execl fork
Pattern(s): 5	
execl doesn t launch a process -- it overlays the existing process with another executable
fork does launch a process -- and returns the child process s id aka pid to the parent process returns 0 to the child process that s how the child knows it s the child so it can clean things up and exec



997309
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
it is useful to check the integrity of a downloaded package such as ubuntu because generating the md5 hash will be identical if the package is exactly the same as the authenticated source
if there are errors in the download from network interference etc. or if you downloaded a malicious package that was made to look like ubuntu but contained other code whatever then the md5 would not match and you would know something was different and you should download again from a different source



999255
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
also look at the native postgresql types point lseg box path polygon and circle if you want to understand more about how postgis works and why its 2d feature implementers have a shorter row to hoe in general
mysql does not implement a lot of spatial queries -- i don t know for sure about contains but there are ways of approximating it and other functions



1018007
punctuation words
Pattern(s): 5	
usually contains seperate words but not sentences ending containing commas and ending in period or equivalent punctuation
you could look for the first and last element containing sentences with punctuation and take everything in between



1039669
nexus artifactory
Pattern(s): 5	
that said i have never used nexus and cannot really help you with a proper feature comparison
here are some things off the top of my head that i really like about artifactory keep in mind nexus may have these features too



1041539
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
thus using keep alive on the apache side is pointless when using nginx in front of it
because though nginx doesn t implement keep alive it should drop the connections promptly as it will have no intention of reusing them so you shouldn t suffer if you do forget to turn of keep alive in apache when using nginx as front end



1046066
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
the reason for this is so you can have many types of hash with different salt and feeds that string into a function that knows how to match it with some other value
if the hash does not use a salt then there is no sign for that



1077520
ant maven
Pattern(s): 5	
learning ant as a build system may be a better first step as it will help you understand the requirements and difficulties in a build
also if maven is not acting the way you want you can always revert to ant and then integrate in the maven bigger picture



1088743
coalesce isnull
Pattern(s): 1	
the coalesce is ansi standard and isnull is not
but more important is the fact that coalesce is more flexible



1106609
disk ram
Pattern(s): 1	
network latency nearly everything that affects application speed said for disk is equivalent for network i o
ram if your ram is not big enough to store your complete application image you need to store it on an external disk



1138476
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
strangely this hack only worked by resetting the width not the height
i came across a similar problem with row height not resizing correctly



1165466
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
a for-loop is just a syntactically prettier way of looping
no changing the type of loops wouldn t matter



1195308
pecl pear
Pattern(s): 3	
even on pecl there doesn t seem to be lots of entries see the languages category for instance only one which you already know
and on pear i don t even find anything that would match your criteria.



1195934
opera google-chrome
Pattern(s): 1	
opera uses fast history navigation
google-chrome doesn t have a page cache 1 2



1218948
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
for example if coercing an int to a string box the int into an int and apply the rule for coercing an int to a string
or if coercing a string to a double apply the rule for coercing a string to a double then unbox the resulting double making sure the resulting double isn t actually null



1222199
wsdl.exe svcutil.exe
Pattern(s): 5	
wsdl.exe is part of the asmx web service technology that microsoft now considers to be legacy code which will not have bugs fixed
actually you should do this with svcutil.exe not with wsdl.exe



1225553
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
your first question is not clear but multiple hash are not less secure because the second hash has a fixed length
but more important than a multiple hash the use of a salt is essential for a better security



1240894
openrowset openquery
Pattern(s): 5	
openrowset has bulk facilities as well that may may not require a format file which might be fiddley
openquery doesn t support variables



1250008
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 3	
while common lisp supports a functional programming style that is not its general focus scheme while not purely functional is much closer
common lisp supports a completely imperative style of programming very well



1252126
jsf seam
Pattern(s): 5	
i like jsf and i evaluated seam not long ago
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3



1255091
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 5	
the dictionary is not thread safe so if you let one thread read from it while another thread is changing it you will have problems
remember that using lock on the map object doesn t protect the map object in itself it s only using the map reference as an identifier to keep more than one thread at a time to run the code inside the lock



1263645
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
if varscount is 0 the for-loop won t execute anyway
it means one of your arrays isn t actually an arrays



1270960
filesystems fat
Pattern(s): 5	
note if you are using the default file-based session handler your filesystems must keep track of access times atime
windows fat does not so you will have to come up with another way to handle garbage collecting your session if you are stuck with a fat filesystems or any other filesystems where atime tracking is not available



1281258
actionscript mxml
Pattern(s): 5	
if your actionscript does not have a reference to the display list than you cannot add the custom component to the display list
adding an mxml based custom component is no different than adding any other displayobject to the display list



1298254
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
to check if the folder exist use directory.exists method
look like the bleh in the path is a directory not a file



1301375
division multiplication
Pattern(s): 5	
obviously after the multiplication has overflowed the division isn t going to undo that overflow
because the multiplication overflows 32 bit integers



1302763
directx gdi
Pattern(s): 5	
directx is not something you would use to draw simple shapes rather render complicated 3d stuff also using dx api under c# is a bit trickier although not that hard
read about gdi gdi+ system.drawing namespace for example here



1310467
gridview detailsview
Pattern(s): 5	
...and the update you click is on the detailsview and not the gridview
so remember to cancel the gridview s editing mode and rebind the gridview



1332465
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
firefox has dropped support in 3.5
safari does not seem to support it but the documentation indicates otherwise



1391801
bindparam bindvalue
Pattern(s): 1	
i m just learning pdo but i think you need to use bindvalue not bindparam
bindparam takes a variable to reference and doesn t pull in a value at the time of calling bindparam



1394648
jquery scriptaculous
Pattern(s): 5	
by the way the page is using lightview wich works with prototype and scriptaculous but not jquery
you could try the jquery ui dialog plugin to stick with jquery and putting an img inside the content to show



1400236
webrat cucumber
Pattern(s): 5	
i think that cucumber is not the problem but webrat
webrat is a browser emulator and i don t think it has any iframe support



1417633
xfs btrfs
Pattern(s): 3	
xfs does not always do so which can result in much better performance for applications which use short-lived temporary files if you have enough ram
i suspect that the modern linux filesystems ext4 btrfs do this too



1447603
directsound mixer
Pattern(s): 5	
for example directsound has a method idirectsoundbuffer that allows you to set the volume for that sound buffer
per-application volume control whether it s exposed via the system mixer or not is a dramatically better experience for customers than an application controlling the master volume



1459435
freemarker velocity
Pattern(s): 3	
freemarker is also a lot more flexible in my experience
velocity isn t really under active development any more



1469060
x86 64bit
Pattern(s): 1	
i m not sure if the x86 architecture supports 8-byte alignment even though they support a 64bit environment
after all 4-byte alignment on a 64bit platform wouldn t harm anything



1500006
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
your code cannot actually work long int is not long enough and this is implementation dependent anyway
you will have to read the integers chars by chars and roll your own implementation of bigints which is the difficulty of the problem here i surmise



1500006
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
you will have to read the int chars by chars and roll your own implementation of bigints which is the difficulty of the problem here i surmise
furthermore you will have to deal with overflow the result of int x int might not fit into an int



1539011
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
in that case flex internally calls the getter to make sure that the value to be set is not the existing value
if the current value of the property as returned by the getter is same as the value to be set the setter is not called



1539011
getter setter
Pattern(s): 3	
note that the getter was called twice but the setter was called only once
in the second assignment since the current value and value to be set are same true the setter is not called



1557382
decoder encoder
Pattern(s): 1	
an amf3 decoder should not use the traits from a partially-constructed object -- such input should be flagged as erroneous
the strings-reference table is implemented at the encoder by tagging in-memory string objects as they are serialized



1585987
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
calloc does indeed touch the memory it writes zeroes on it and thus you ll be sure the os is backing the allocation with actual ram or swap
this is also why it is slower than malloc not only does it have to zero it the os must also find a suitable memory area by possibly swapping out other processes



1612864
uiviewcontroller uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 1	
in each uiviewcontroller not only do you set your nib file but also the class
in ib when using uitabbarcontroller which has multiple uiviewcontrollers which all separately have their own nib file assigned there are two places where you need to set your uiviewcontroller class file



1618621
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp does not guarantee that a given packet was actually received so encoding whatever you transmit as a difference from last time is problematic -- you can t know that your counterpart has the same idea as you about what the last time was
essentially you d have to build some overhead on top of udp to check what packets have been received tagging each packet with a unique id -- everybody who s tried to go this route will agree that more often than not you find yourself more or less duplicating the tcp streaming infrastructure on top of udp.



1630987
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
pl postgresql is actually a nice language + you can use many other languages
mysql doesn t have sequences so if you need them you have to roll your own



1632045
strdup malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
in returning a string the example used the function strdup to allocate a string passed with a np_something method
fact is that npapi takes care of the allocated string from that point on and when tries to destroy it it cannot since strdup uses malloc and not npn_memalloc



1648101
punctuation words
Pattern(s): 5	
it looks for your punctuation set not preceded by a string starting with http and ending with a whitespace character
the trailing b prevents a hyphenated words from causing a split



1648773
vim textmate
Pattern(s): 5	
vim offers coloration for diff files
if you d rather go graphical use macvim which is free or textmate not free



1665680
salt dpapi
Pattern(s): 1	
the salt adds an additional layer of difficulty in doing so
dpapi cannot usually be used in web farms - the key store is specific to the machine



1667192
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
for example google-chrome doesn t highlight the options in the drop down
firefox does but then it doesn t change them back if you move the mouse away and they are still pulled down



1681855
uiviewcontroller uinavigationcontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
therefore your approach is exactly right use uinavigationcontroller s subclass of uiviewcontroller in place of standard view controllers when you want to achieve navigation within a given tab
the uitabbarcontroller represents its sub-tabs as an array of uiviewcontroller s not an array of uinavigationcontroller s



1689550
smtps smtp-auth
Pattern(s): 5	
basic smtps doesn t require auth at all
smtp-auth is defined in rfc 4954 but it doesn t define the specific type of auth you re using here auth login



1692137
pexpect subprocess
Pattern(s): 1	
as i ve often said use pexpect not subprocess etc to run subprocess when you need to get their continuous output
pexpect fools the subprocess into believing it s running on a terminal so the subprocess will provide just the kind of output it would give on a real terminal.



1711204
ienumerable iqueryable
Pattern(s): 5	
the where extension methods for ienumerable indeed take a system.func which is how you are trying to pass the predicate here
but you re working with iqueryable not ienumerable



1715461
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
a md5 hash has no internal structure or any kind of signature that allows you detect if a 128 bit value is a md5 hash or not
a md5 hash is a 128 bit value



1717875
cpu affinity
Pattern(s): 5	
so you may be starving ssis of cpu not memory
you could try changing processors affinity to allow sql server to use only 16 cores and let the memory find it s own level



1717875
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 2	
so you may be starving ssis of cpu not memory
you could try changing processors affinity to allow sql server to use only 16 cores and let the memory find it s own level



1726531
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
set up a public maven repository deploy the parent pom.xml to it and put the repository information in the child poms
you can tell maven to look for the parent pom.xml on a relative path before it checks repositories this is to help you when you have local changes to the parent pom.xml not yet deployed



1733555
octal binary
Pattern(s): 3	
hex and octal are close enough to binary
most data on a hdd is binary data not meant to represent printable characters so if you use cat a command meant to output text not binary you get meaningless mush



1746956
fgets getline
Pattern(s): 5	
if you can bound the maximum length of a line fgets may be a better way to read each line
but since you mention c++ you might consider using instead getline caveat fgets also put the n in the buffer it fills getline doesn t



1749863
sequence permutation
Pattern(s): 5	
covering the permutation in sort sequence is not the most efficient approach to password cracking although it will ultimately be effective
an approach to achieving full coverage is to iterate 0 through the number of permutation and encode the value with the size of your character set as a base



1753040
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
storing the salt unencrypted in the database next to the hash passwords is not a problem
the purpose of the salt is not to be secret



1759072
strlen substr
Pattern(s): 1	
you are using multibyte strings and strlen is not mb aware use the idioms substr session 0 -32 to get the payload part of the string
maybe substr doesn t cope with multibyte strings too use explicitally mb_substr or whatever it is called



1777759
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb maintains referential integriry
myisam does not



1802269
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 1	
but the case conversion table is stored on the filesystems itself for ntfs and it does change between versions for instance the vista case conversion table was brought to the unicode 5 level so vista ntfs and xp ntfs have different case conversion rules
and the thing that matters is the os that formatted the filesystems not the current os



1809053
swt swing
Pattern(s): 5	
this is usually problem of swing not swt swt is directly linked to os framework provided widgets - a quote from a gentle introduction to swt and jface 2
swt is a library that creates a java



1884628
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
however the combination of a salt and a password may lead to the same string or hash in the end and the hash will be exactly the same so make sure to use a combination of salt and password where two different combination won t lead to the same hash
another intention behind the use of a salt is to make sure two users with the same password won t end up having the same hash in the users table assuming their salt are not the same



1891994
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
server-side it ll work - assuming that the server-side call isn t an ajax postback cause then in reality the actual dynamic insertion is still client-side
client-side it won t you can t simply inject java-script into a page after it s already loaded and expect it to execute



1893638
freebsd linux
Pattern(s): 5	
all servers are nix-like freebsd os x linux but not all run apache
my freebsd mirror runs xshttpd



1946361
mouse keyboard
Pattern(s): 5	
for the mouse i ve found pymouse which seems to work i haven t fully tried it a small hack needed for the click cf the issues
for the keyboard i m not sure xlib can do the job



1946820
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 1	
that said if you re using vb.net i would suggest the correct way to use resources is always within a using statement
if this is actually vb6 as originally described in the question then you need tear down the file object and release memory because vb6 is not garbage collected you need to do this explicitly



1946932
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 3	
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case
tcp should not introduce any noise



1951458
hash salt
Pattern(s): 2	
edit as op noted just using a hash algorithm isn t enough
you must to add a salt to make it harder to break



1952390
gif png
Pattern(s): 1	
the gif format doesn t support this so unfortunately no there isn t a way to do it
the edges in a png are smooth because of anti-aliasing and thus variable opacity



2049167
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want the application folder use the application.startuppath property
yes it s normal and no the current directory is not always the application folder



2051084
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
the is maybe superfluous but it shows the fact that the parent superclass should not be instanciated
the subclassing has no additional property so the subclassing tag is empty



2054971
jlist jtable
Pattern(s): 5	
jlist is not yet editable and might never be
jtable would handle the layout problems for you and you can easily access the values via the table



2062470
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 5	
the reason for this is gcc essentially says use c rules when driving the tool chain and g++ says use c++ rules when driving the tool chain
g++ knows that to create a working executable it needs to pass -lstdc++ to the linker stage whereas gcc obviously doesn t think this is necessary even though it knew to use the c++ compiler at the compile the source code stage because of the .cc file ending



2081470
profiling instrumentation
Pattern(s): 5	
a profiling will not be a solution to a coding style that is x slower than optimal however you still need to spend time fine-tuning those parts of your code that are used more often than others
because of instrumentation profiled code on average will run slower than non-profiled code



2088188
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 1	
alternatively you could further raise the technological stakes by having the daemons return not the password but rather the open socket ready to be wrapped in a db-api compliant wrapper
some unix systemd allow open file descriptors to be sent between unrelated processes a prereq for this approach -- and of course you d have to substantially rework the mysql-based db api to allow opening a connection around an already-open socket rather than a freshly made one



2096717
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 1	
stdout is line-buffered by default so that is relatively safe
stderr is not



2104528
post put
Pattern(s): 5	
post is not idempotent
so you should not use for the update or the delete instead use put and delete from rest



2126370
textarea textbox
Pattern(s): 3	
if you want multiline text input you should be using textarea not input textbox
textbox are only a single line of text so no newlines



2138221
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 1	
don t use accessor messages implicit properties accesses or explicit
any impure custom accessor may not be safe to call on a partially-deallocated object



2143664
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
as far as i know there is no way to use the old prototyping methodology for getter setter infact i believe the grand total of internal flex sdk classes that use any type of prototyping is 0
in any case getter setter aren t available in the prototype-hacking game



2188765
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 5	
use g++ to compile c++ programs it ll link in the standard c++ library
gcc will not



2215783
int boolean
Pattern(s): 1	
so yes it seems that the ternary operator is causing the constants to fix their types as int and disable the implicit type conversion that you would otherwise get from constants that fit within the smaller type
i m using vs 2005 for and i can reproduce for bool boolean but not for true



2233311
opera safari
Pattern(s): 5	
well firefox and opera do not support non-free codecs such as mp3 as with the opera 10.5 alpha firefox 3.5 and later supports only pcm wav and ogg vorbis for audio
i believe google-chrome and safari do support mp3 however



2269313
haskell ocaml
Pattern(s): 1	
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor
the only problem i can see is that ocaml doesn t really support multicore parallelism while ghc has excellent support and performance



2293964
bash subshell
Pattern(s): 5	
i know bash not ksh but there s a lot of overlap so maybe this will work there too
creates a subshell running process2



2324542
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
you cannot affect client-side print settings with a server-side language not even vb.net
the web server and the browser run in different machines and neither html nor client-side javascript define such features



2328556
free malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
applying new delete to a class type t will call the constructor and destructor respectively of t malloc free do not call the constructor and destructor of t
malloc will return null in case of memory exhaustion new will throw an exception



2335441
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
you have to look at your repository s folder not the program folder
the directory structure is per repository



2355059
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 5	
for as long as i remember c had typedef but i don t know if it was true when struct have been introduced handling of typedef is a nuisance in the c grammar
in the old code i ve seen using typedef for struct isn t done and there are things like unix



2371109
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
but maven doesn t
to solve the problem either remove the jta exclusion in simple-persist pom.xml that s the quick and very dirty fix or fix the hibernate dependencies to make them converge that would be the right fix



2393989
nunit mstest
Pattern(s): 1	
nunit allows abstract classes to be test fixtures so you can inherit test fixtures
mstest does not



2399876
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
if you give the div a fixed width it s easy to use negative margins
without a fixed height you cannot center the div vertically without javascript



2415238
bazaar git
Pattern(s): 3	
this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster
this is one of the way cool features of bazaar that doesn t get enough press the ability for people to work the way that makes them comfortable even on the same shared repository



2422086
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
also you want c to be of type int not chars
this is because in c eof is a small negative number and if chars is unsigned comparing it against a negative number convert the value of eof to a positive value equal to eof + uchar_max + 1 most likely



2432278
ant maven
Pattern(s): 5	
so people have to judge between how easy they can adjust their builds for how maven works and how long they can wait for a bug fix and how hard it will become to maintain a complex ant build script
the problem with maven is not when it works it s when it breaks



2435935
ant maven
Pattern(s): 5	
you already know the answer to the very oriented body of your question there is no ant equivalent to this minimal pom.xml because unlike maven ant does not define a set of standards patterns conventions in other words a lingua franca or shared language for project management that would make it possible so ant can t beat maven on this sample
somehow yes and i believe that most complains about maven s complexity are due to ignorance i know ant well i know how to do things in ant ant is simple i don t know maven i don t get it i don t know how to do things i feel lost i feel constrained i don t want to learn it maven is complex. and fud



2446978
rss feed
Pattern(s): 1	
in the case of the rss feed to make sure that you are getting something back
it s possible the rss page doesn t have the same javascript components and that it returns an empty string



2454600
rtos isr
Pattern(s): 1	
however a preemptive rtos like freertos uses its own stack frame typically bigger than the stack frame generated by the compiler because an rtos must store the complete context
in this case __bic_sr_register_on_exit called from an isr might not find the sr on the stack



2458944
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
mysql fulltext indexes are only possibles for tables in myisam -- not for tables in innodb
and only innodb supports foreign keys transactions .



2482037
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
i consistently see a small 1 penalty for the while loops over the corresponding for-loop but i don t have good explanation for it
the loops are not equivalent and you are primarily thrashing the bigint package and it has nothing to do with for vs while per se



2517670
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	
while md5 has been broken those breaks only allow you to create two different files images with the same hash but not with a predetermined hash
what you want is called a pre-image attack and since md5 is still unbroken concerning that attack you need to bruteforce



2521962
mousemove mousedown
Pattern(s): 1	
in an admittedly silly attempt to avoid writing the same block of code twice i was calling my mousedown handler from within the mousemove handler thinking that certain conditions namely neither mouse button being held down would cause the mousedown handler to effectively do nothing
the issue was that the mouse button was being held down because the filedialog box disappears on mousedown not mouseclick



2535829
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 1	
i used virtualbox + ubuntu + eclipse for several projects i worked on
if you decide that linux is not for you and your project was in eclipse then you will have no problem switching back to windows since eclipse is available for both operating systems



2536537
distance mercator
Pattern(s): 5	
i suggest that before you perform the calculations you transform your lat long pair to utm coordinates and work in distance not angular measurements
if you are not familiar with universal transverse mercator hit google or wikipedia



2539119
webrat cucumber
Pattern(s): 5	
since cucumber uses webrat to inspect the response coming back from the server and webrat doesn t support javascript your scenario fails
cucumber can use selenium to automate javascript testing and verify that the expected values are being plugged in



2556403
rsa aes
Pattern(s): 1	
a rsa key as its name says is for rsa not for aes
aes uses a symmetric key namely an array of arbitrary bytes of length 16 24 or 32 bytes



2568198
des aes
Pattern(s): 3	
des is not considered secure anymore you should always avoid using it
aes is still considered safe you could use 256 bits keys



2570702
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
although some compiler allocate memory for new using malloc free doesn t call destructors
so if you mix new with free you ll get memory leaks and a lot of hard to deal with problems



2570960
abstract-class superclass
Pattern(s): 1	
abstract-class are useful when you need a class for the purpose of inherited and polymorphism but it makes no sense to instantiate the class itself only its subclassing
they are commonly used when you want to define a template for a group of subclassing that share some common implementation code but you also want to guarantee that the objects of the superclass cannot be created



2580143
jsfl fla
Pattern(s): 5	
here s an ant script with a jsfl command has example
the jsfl use a parameter to force or not force a compilation even if the fla was not modified



2615034
cvs svn
Pattern(s): 1	
cvs svn allows different files in the working directory to come from different revisions while dvcs es usually have one revision for the entire wc always even if a file is be reverted to an earlier version it will show as modified in status as it is different from the file in the checked out revision
svn cvs does not show this always.



2623806
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
since you mention wow they use udp not tcp
tcp offers stream guarantee semantics with order guarantee and no duplicates



2626911
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
visual studio directory aren t just virtual folder though they can contain filter rules so when you add a file to your project it will automatically get added to the correct filtered folder
they can also specify whether the folder should be under version control or not



2632426
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 5	
if the type would have to be comparable you couldn t create a treeset with a non-comparable type and a comparator which you can as it is now
one way to fix this while still being type-safe would have been to have two classes one with a comparable type parameter and one with a non-comparable type parameter and no default constructor only the constructor that takes a comparator but i suppose the java devs didn t want to introduce two classes that basically did the same thing though one could easily be implemented as a wrapper around the other



2638231
int boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
int isn t a boolean and if you want for some reason to store boolean as int then you should hone your own standards of how the truth and not truth are represented
boolean true is not a number it is an instance of the boolean type



2663049
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
with that in mind you could use parent relationships as adam suggests and keep an incomplete count on each node which counts the number of immediate children that aren t yet complete
when you mark a node complete decrement its parent node s count



2672933
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	
also given a hash you cannot get the original value well you can always try cracking it that s the purpose of a hash
the result is always the same because an md5 hash has always the same length



2682873
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 1	
they are all modeled after firebug an extension for firefox and the existence of which is why firefox doesn t have one built in
opera internet explorer chrome and safari all come with good debuggers built in links go to information about the debuggers



2683666
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
as a general rule a good hash will not hash two similar but unequal strings to similar hash
md5 is good enough that this isn t a problem



2688976
trie tree
Pattern(s): 5	
on the other hand trie are not meant for requests like all words between xx and zz
note that the branching factor of the b+ tree affects its performance the number of intermediary nodes



2700131
runtimeexception unchecked-exception
Pattern(s): 5	
to summarize runtimeexception are a subset of unchecked-exception for exceptions from which recovery is possible but unchecked-exception is not a synonym of runtimeexception as many are answering here
as stated by their name unchecked-exception are not checked at compile-time which means that the compiler doesn t require methods to catch or to specify with a throws them



2700609
glassfish resin
Pattern(s): 1	
glassfish 3.0 very low level and sometimes complex glassfish 3.1 has new refactored websocket support which is more developer friendly v 3.1.2 supports rfc6455
caucho resin 4.0.2 not yet tried v 4.0.25 supports rfc6455



2707839
std ostream
Pattern(s): 1	
std streambuf has a virtual function overflow which you can override and use to alter the bytes before passing them to the wrapped output class
std ostream is not the best place to implement filtering



2733360
noscript meta
Pattern(s): 2	
since meta isn t allowed in the body of a page and noscript isn t legal in the head section perhaps the bots are just giving up on a page where they hit bad html
i suggest you simply use a noscript tag to encapsulate a warning message and a link that the user can click on if they do not have javascript switched on



2748392
xsl-fo xslt
Pattern(s): 3	
generating xsl-fo and xhtml from xslt is not necessarily an either-or choice
xsl-fo is generally used to generate pdf



2757869
phpunit simpletest
Pattern(s): 5	
phpunit is more popular and up to date as simpletest hasn t had a new release for some time though for testing webforms it s still very useful as phpunit does not have good support for that
it s also said that simpletest has better support for some of the more advanced techniques called mocking replacing part of a class to test with something under your own control



2766529
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
another difference is that hiding content client-side does not remove it from the dom - the content is there just hidden
hiding controls server-side prevents their content from even being emitted to the html



2770491
gridview repeater
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want more flexibility in the output than gridview provides take a look at repeater
since the repeater doesn t directly implement paging you ll have to supply your own next and previous buttons



2781823
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
you should never ever add the obj folder to version control as it is a folder completely managed by msbuild which will add and remove files and subdirectories whenever it likes to
the bin directory should not note the difference be versioned as it contains output instead of source files



2806177
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
so the superclass defines the flow from an abstract viewpoint and the subclassing implement them appropriately
in your case the simplest options are to either just leave performtransform empty in the superclass or implement it as an empty method in the subclassing that doesn t require it when you mix this approach with a short comment you get a more maintainable system imo



2830965
pthreads fork
Pattern(s): 5	
on pthreads systems spork uses kernel.fork
on windows fork is not an option so spork creates a pool of preloaded processes which



2834995
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the for-loop will run exactly 3 times - the length of que vector this is why you get three 5s instead of seven
changing len inside loops will not help since range for i variable is determined before the for-loop started and cannot be changed on run time



2865849
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
getter will not impact the state of the entity - setter will
throwing on a setter is enforcing the integrity of the model



2868914
mouseout mouseleave
Pattern(s): 5	
ppk has some excellent documentation on what is actually happening and why mouseout isn t doing what you think it should at that point technically you are mousing out of the layer when you mouseover its children which is a little odd conceptually
mouseleave will do the trick for you



2872864
xna slimdx
Pattern(s): 5	
xna requires a gpu with a least pixel vertex shaders 1.1 while i think slimdx does not
slimdx supports directx10 and 11 while xna only supports directx 9



2872864
xna slimdx
Pattern(s): 5	
slimdx supports directx10 and 11 while xna only supports directx 9
xna is a cross platform between windows xbox 360 zune and windows phone 7 while slimdx is not



2872864
xna slimdx
Pattern(s): 1	
xna is a cross platform between windows xbox 360 zune and windows phone 7 while slimdx is not
xna has a strong community creators.xna.com with tons of tutorials and help materials



2893513
arp dhcp
Pattern(s): 1	
listening for arp requests is the canonical way to do this
independent of dhcp or not any connected computer that wishes to communicate with the outside world will have to make an arp request for the address of the default router



2914583
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to perform a client-side disabling you ll need to use script for that or perhaps use a readonly attribute
specifying is like a server-side disable not a client-side disable



2920482
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
computing an md5 hash of your text-including-the-to-be-computed md5 hash is not possible
well adding a md5 hash to a text changes the text and thus the md5 hash



2941964
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql has full support for utf8
mysql doesn t support the complete utf8-encoding



2948582
mouseleave mousedown
Pattern(s): 1	
edit shout out to jandy for the point about mouseleave edited the above to use it
mousedown doesn t have an automatic repeat but you could create one via setinterval and then turn it off on mouseup via clearinterval



2950906
base-class derived-class
Pattern(s): 1	
public all public members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class
protected all protected members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and not to the instances of derived-class



2950906
base-class derived-class
Pattern(s): 1	
protected all protected members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and not to the instances of derived-class
protected internal all protected internal members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class created within the same assembly



2951991
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
which is a bad idea because of rainbow tables even if the hash is not md5 but sha512 for example
second idea add a unique random salt before hashing so the hackers has to bruteforce each password



2958685
free malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
free accepts null pointers
malloc doesn t need a cast in c



2963894
ivar subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	
joanna s answers are both correct though ivar synthesis doesn t kick in on 32 bit mac os x
the reason though is because allowing a subclassing to synthesize access to a superclass s internal state would quite explicitly break encapsulation



2967501
glut fltk
Pattern(s): 1	
fltk has a partial glut simulation but it s partial enough that a program that makes heavy use of glut may not work with it in the first place
since fltk is in active development i d guess it ll eventually support opengl 3.x or 4.x but i don t believe it s provided yet and it may be open to question how soon it will be either



2968222
vtune gprof
Pattern(s): 1	
vtune is not bad although i don t like the interface
else gprof is not bad and its free. and see which parts of your code is taking up cpu cycles



3029122
ssl https
Pattern(s): 1	
this still leaves the possibility of mitm attacks but performing an mitm attack on an ssl connection isn t entirely trivial so it s probably not an attack vector you need to be too concerned with
you can muck around with client-side hashing but in general posting the credentials over a secure https connection is considered sufficient



3032329
maven m2e
Pattern(s): 3	
maven isn t looking in the wrong repository and dependencies on hibernate 3.5.1 artifacts are available in the jboss repository and get resolved
however m2e is very likely not configured to use the nexus index of the jboss repository and you need to enable this index in your m2e installation



3032916
maven m2e
Pattern(s): 1	
the jdk compliance level is derived from the maven project not the other way around
in other words you need to configure the maven compiler plugin for 1.6 level compliance and then m2e will derive the appropriate settings under eclipse



3041832
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 1	
but scheme is not common lisp which is what lisp typically means today they are really different languages
if you want to learn common lisp i would start with common lisp and skip scheme



3046552
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
an int is a number that means something
an int that is basically the concatenation of chars s doesn t really mean anything



3073344
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 1	
learning common lisp is not that difficult but getting deeper experience get take some time because the language and its eco-system is surprisingly rich
learning scheme is useful too



3098357
appfuse spring
Pattern(s): 2	
once you have that in hand then bring appfuse in to lighten your load
spring does not require that it be in the root directory to work



3126262
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	
you can t reverse a one-way hash theoretically you can find a plaintext that has an equivalent hash which is generally as good but you can t in any reasonable amount of time so you just need to set a new password and email it to them as a temporary and or just provide them a link to reset their password
md5 isn t encryption - it s a one-way hash



3154872
awt swing
Pattern(s): 5	
keep in mind that awt swing have a dedicated thread that does gui work handling event handlers repainting the gui etc
if you do long-running things on that thread swing will not repaint



3157314
codeigniter kohana
Pattern(s): 3	
kohana is no longer simply a codeigniter fork and has not been for a while so sadly the code cannot be simply copied and pasted across
also codeigniter does not have modules just mvc components libraries and helpers so i m not sure what you would be copying from codeigniter



3168509
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
a password hash cannot be broken until the salt is retrieved
salt make precomputed attacks more resource intensive but never impossible



3171322
cassini iis
Pattern(s): 5	
cassini doesn t do url rewriting
you might want to look at the recently announced iis express version which will



3173818
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
in fact you don t need the for-loop on p since the outer for-loop takes care of iterating through s
the while loops doesn t have any guard for when you reach the end of s so it s pretty easy to run off of the end of s have a partially matched t at the end of s



3186640
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
at the moment it s possible that there is some space after stringarray into which you are storing the wordlength-arraylength extra pointers when you calloc them and realloc doesn t move stringarray
it s quite probable that 0xb49010 is one of the pointers you calloc d and you re overwritten the memory where malloc keeps its block size



3196933
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
adding a salt to your hash does not make a pre-computed attack impossible only more difficult
re-use of a salt makes your system more prone to attack



3207181
vbscript wql
Pattern(s): 3	
you haven t said what language you re using - i guess in powershell or c# the whole thing can be done more elegantly but vbscript is pretty verbose
wql doesn t support the join clause



3232713
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
if you only need this for a small amount of text like a heading you should be able to achieve the effect in safari google-chrome using -webkit-background-clip text and -webkit-gradient
firefox doesn t support this yet.



3248382
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
for example an image takes 3 packets to transfer udp does not guarantee that all 3 packes will arive at the destination and if they do it does not guarantee that they ll arrive in the same order you ve sent
now for tcp reestablishing a new connection for every file could be done yes but it is not necessary



3317833
textarea textbox
Pattern(s): 1	
when a textbox is in multiline mode it s rendered as a textarea instead of an input element
the textarea element doesn t use the value attribute so your code fails to set the initial value



3319405
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 3	
apache isn t really a typical setup for python in my experience
python webapps are usually daemons that are exposed to the public with a reverse proxy webserver in front nginx is very common



3345417
scheme racket
Pattern(s): 1	
racket also includes a lot of standard libraries web server that other scheme do not
for one big example racket lists are immutable by default whereas scheme s are mutable



3376528
nsbitmapimagerep nsimage
Pattern(s): 2	
there is an nsimage method to convert to tiff data and there is an nsbitmapimagerep method to convert to data in several formats
the way you say you re making an nsimage doesn t make sense



3379273
ienumerable ienumerator
Pattern(s): 5	
ienumerable doesn t inherit from idisposable because typically the class that implements it only gives you the promise of being enumerable it hasn t actually done anything yet that warrants disposal
however when you enumerate over it you first retrieve an ienumerator by calling the ienumerable.getenumerator method and typically the underlying object you get back does implement idisposable



3417323
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
firefox extensions have much more power than google-chrome and have wider access to browser s internal api
firebug lite for google-chrome is not able to track http requests yet



3446210
macports homebrew
Pattern(s): 5	
unfortunately the is very normal with macports and is the reason that people many have switched to homebrew
however i found this post because homebrew doesn t include meld



3457180
disk ram
Pattern(s): 5	
if it s close to 100 an ssd or hybrid disk won t help you at all you simply need a faster cpu
hard disk speed is a large factor when initially loading the project but for every compilation run after that a machine with sufficient ram doesn t need to touch the hard disk at all - all your source files will be cached by the os



3477456
post get
Pattern(s): 3	
a post unlike a get typically has relevant information in the body of the request
a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url. besides keeping the url relatively cleaner post also lets you send much more information as urls are limited in length for all practical purposes and lets you send just about any type of data file upload forms for example can t use get -- they have to use post plus a special content type encoding



3480492
bitblt gdi
Pattern(s): 5	
bitblt is a gdi call not gdi+
gdi doesn t preserve the alpha channel



3491048
geocoding geocode
Pattern(s): 1	
and things improved a lot but geocoding is not an exact science
in any case you might be using an old version of the geocode because i get a postal code with this request



3505368
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
after you authenticate a user you start a session and in that session you store md5 username+time and also store a cookie on users browser of md5 username+time then on subsequent page requests you could check your session hash matches the cookie hash to assert the user is who they say they are
md5 is not a good hash for this type of thing but hashing in general can help in situations such as these



3505879
free malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
additionally c++ s new and delete could actually request a larger amount of memory from malloc and use the extra for book keeping like storing the address of the destructor function and so the pointer you passed to free would not actually be one that was malloc ed
c++ wants to call a destructor on the object when you use delete but passing it to free doesn t allow this to happen



3507128
ssl https
Pattern(s): 3	
it s not difficult and ssl certificates aren t expensive startcom s free startssl certs might be sufficient for your purposes
if https is really too much work assuming you re using custom session-management code it s not too difficult to return a random mac key on login and sign future requests using the key and a sequence number to prevent replays



3514705
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
folder in private locations on the drive like in a user s home directory aren t necessarily accessible by the user that sql server runs as
it matters less what folder you have access to than what folder sql server has or should have access to



3521428
gtk gdk
Pattern(s): 5	
cairo and gtk are not directly relevant with shaped windows
you need to look at gdk which is the windowing system for gtk



3539194
maven m2e
Pattern(s): 5	
if your project is already imported update the project configuration right-click on the project then maven v update project configuration
the m2e plugin doesn t use eclipse defaults the m2e plugin derives the settings from the pom.xml



3551657
raphael excanvas
Pattern(s): 5	
svg raphael isn t going to work on android don t know about iphone
conversely if you want something that will work with old versions of internet excanvas may not work not sure if excanvas supports ie6 but svg does to some extent raphael supports ie6



3574494
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
the best you could do is write a custom action that walks your featuretree and disables parent when children and not set to install
otherwise can you possibly rearrange your feature tree components so that the parent features don t install anything



3587158
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
the temporary upload folder is specified in php settings as upload_tmp_dir
make sure your file destination and tmp upload directory do not



3598447
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the return value from getchar is an int not a chars
on most machines it can return 256 different positive chars values even if chars is a signed type and a separate value eof that is distinct from all the chars values



3605068
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
your html was invalid and google-chrome did not accept it
firefox was more lenient in what it allowed



3621561
vbscript vba
Pattern(s): 5	
vbscript is also the language used to create custom outlook forms outlook-forms
although vbscript has much common syntax with vba do not tag vbscript questions as vba unless you are specifically asking about both



3628644
nsstring nsdata
Pattern(s): 1	
luckily nsstring has a datausingencoding method to make it super easy
-sethttpbody accepts nsdata not an nsstring



3680692
int chars
Pattern(s): 2	
in you are adding a chars to an int an int can be much bigger than a chars so it chooses the bigger data type int to be the result a.k.a
so the result of the addition is an int which cannot fit into the chars c



3689681
filesystems fat
Pattern(s): 5	
naturally the underlying filesystems must also support a file that large
on windows ntfs does but fat doesn t for instance



3716598
rtp sdp
Pattern(s): 1	
sdp doesn t define the ssrc that will be used by each of the rtp participants -- yes as ssrc can be changed on the fly
you can manually add rtp participants discovered in other ways but you have no idea what the ssrc s will be



3783636
uiview calayer
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want a button that actually works on top of a calayer put that calayer into a uiview which is a subclass of uiresponder and add a uibutton to that view so it can get added to the event response chain
a calayer is not an event responder so trying to hook it up to a touch event handler will do nothing



3791562
printf strtod
Pattern(s): 1	
keep in mind thatr when i said reconstruct the original value i mean the actual value which was held in the variable expression passed to printf not the original decimal you wrote in the source file which got rounded to the best binary representation by the compiler
since you asked about scanf one thing you should note is that posix requires printf and a subsequent scanf or strtod to reconstruct the original value exactly as long as sufficiently significant digits at least decimal_dig i believe were printed



3825328
xna slimdx
Pattern(s): 5	
based off of your concern of slimdx documentation and the fact that you want to use multitouch which i can t determine if that is accessible from slimdx - refer to documentation comment i d suggest going with xna
xna doesn t have immediate support for ogg but there are several nice converters out there



3840749
floating-point fractions
Pattern(s): 3	
floating-point numbers are normally represented as binary fractions times a power of two for efficiency
this is about as accurate as base-10 representation except that there are decimal fractions that cannot be exactly represented as binary fractions



3843982
spaces delimiter
Pattern(s): 1	
the extra spaces is mandatory according to perldoc perlpod scroll down from here to find it
a more readable and perhaps more plain way is to use an alternate set of delimiter that doesn t require a single to be escaped



3844173
helpers actioncontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
one thing to note since the helpers uses the predispatch hook i believe it will get called on every action even an internal forward
the actioncontroller is not directly accessible directly from a front-controller plugin



3854434
free malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
somebody say that this behavior can mask double-frees since free null doesn t produce errors but imho this is better than the alternative
one important detail you re not checking the return value of malloc which is quite bad



3899467
macports homebrew
Pattern(s): 5	
still macports does not seem to have a way to install a previous version of imagemagick so i installed it from source
homebrew might be a better option



3901979
strcpy strdup
Pattern(s): 5	
strcpy does not allocate new memory area for the string it only copies data from one buffer to another
you need to allocate new buffers using strdup or create the array pre-allocated



3926623
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
define these versioning explicitly in your references so that if you upgrade the .net versioning it will continue to use the old versioning and not the new
then you should be free to upgrade all other referenced libraries without concern over the upgrade affecting your interface



3939107
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
since you select innodb when creating tables all of your tables are innodb not myisam
myisam is the default storage engine on your server



3941211
mouseover mouseout
Pattern(s): 5	
what s happening is that the jquery animate function that is started on mouseover isn t finished when the mouseout event is fired.
thus the 100ms delay before the z-index change is suppose to happen on the show part of the animation ends up happening after the z-index is changed on the mouseout hide function



3984819
repo egit
Pattern(s): 1	
that notion of dedicated repo is not a new one and has been used before for local repo used for testing before pushing to a remote repo but it can easily be adapted for the kind of automatic pushing you are looking for
for a strong eclipse integration i would go with git even though egit is not fully baked yet all eclipse projects for the development of eclipse itself are or will be soon on git repo



4006604
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 3	
on a good compiler for a modern platform inline will affect only a very few functions
it is just a hint to the compiler modern compilers are fairly good at making this decision themselves and the the overhead of a function call has become rather small often the main benefit of inlining is not to reduce call overhead but opening up further optimizations



4050987
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
for more compact notation a for-loop is the way to go
the equivalent with a while loops is not so readable



4063990
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
and as already noted setter getter are not implemented in ie
also i m not sure about how wise it is to have a setter that is the same name as the property it sets



4067747
pecl pear
Pattern(s): 5	
http pecl requires libcurl
http pear does not use curl but fsockopen



4069769
printwriter bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 1	
so while printwriter does not have the specific constructor you might want it does have a constructor that takes another writer so you can do something like the following
as a general usage note you always want to wrap a low-level writer eg filewriter or outputstreamwriter in a bufferedwriter to minimize actual io operations



4069980
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
ext js comes included with a debugging console you need to add debug.js and call ext.log blah to bring it up this will provide functionality that is similar to firebug on firefox but not as extensive still its useful for supplementing the poor development tools that come pre-installed with ie 8
firebug as ergo mentioned here is the most powerful of the browser-based development tools it allows step-by-step debugging however the latest versions of chrome and safari also come installed with develoment tools that are useful but not as much as firebug



4070043
strncmp strcmp
Pattern(s): 3	
make certain you use strncmp and not strcmp
strcmp is profoundly unsafe



4074938
mef prism
Pattern(s): 5	
well keep in mind that mef won t be officially part of prism until version 4.0 is released it is in ctp right now but they can definitely be used together
on the other hand mvvm is not strictly part of prism it is possible to use prism and mvvm but it is possible to use prism and not use mvvm and vice-versa

cassini iis
Pattern(s): 5	
cassini does not support s
cassini runs as your account whoever is logged on iis runs as a service which means some things change quite a bit



4102615
ssl https
Pattern(s): 1	
however the wide availability of ssl tls stacks on various languages platforms os makes it rather convenient for many applications to protect the communication between the client and the server via https
not using https doesn t mean that your system is going to be insecure although it might require a bit of work to protect the data



4103057
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
as for coding practices that would prevent such bugs i d recommend that you a. put these types of functions that require temporary variables in functions and b. unit test since the second for-loop would not execute by itself a unit test for just that for-loop would catch your error
if you want the variables to go away after loops ends refactor loops into a function



4119148
actionscript mxml
Pattern(s): 5	
the advantage i see using actionscript is command over your application you have more control
sometimes your mxml does not get you the itch of what you are looking and actionscript gives you more power



4121333
primefaces richfaces
Pattern(s): 1	
primefaces is tiny and can be implemented in the code easily - not too many dependencies
richfaces does not support jsf 2.0 till now nov 2010 - primefaces has a stable release that supports jsf 2.0



4125074
division subtraction
Pattern(s): 1	
division requires iterative subtraction that cannot be performed simultaneously so it takes longer
in fact some fp units speed up division by performing a reciprocal approximation and multiplying by that

apache automatically sees the location header in the response and forces the response code to be 300-series if you haven t previously set a response code of your own
nginx does not do this -- it expects you set the proper response code yourself



4162480
jdk1.6 jdk1.5
Pattern(s): 5	
i have a file with all details of printgc for jdk1.6 but couldn t find a tool to read that
previously with jdk1.5 we used hpjmeter it worked fine but now with jdk1.6 it doesn t



4169523
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 5	
in my case i have the daemons doing more than 1 thing so it s very helpful to have systemd keep track of all the timers for me so that i can effectively poll stream_select for the xmpp connection
i m actually work on something very close to what you described but in my case the daemons doesn t poll for event it get s them asynchronously via xmpp but that s besides the point



4181446
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
safari does not store content in the dom google-chrome does
google-chrome keeps each browser window sandboxed in its own operating system process multi-process model



4183683
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 5	
but my suggestion is that instead of using multiple uilabel just concentrate on nsattributedstring
find uicontrollers that draw nsattributedstring because uilabel uitextview do not support nsattributedstring



4199127
ssl https
Pattern(s): 3	
some google engineers wrote an article explaining how some previous assumptions about ssl are no longer true
i think the faster performance you re seeing over https isn t a fluke



4233878
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities
myisam is not transacted and doesn t implement foreign key constraints which is a major drawback



4243560
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 1	
if it returns null either the properties has no accessor which should never happen or all of the properties accessor do not have the same virtual status -- at least one is and one is not virtual
technically properties are not virtual -- their accessor are



4253527
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
the int and short are equal because upgrading a short to an int will not change its value
the reason the float and double are not equal is because their values differ slightly



4257480
qstring qtextdocument
Pattern(s): 2	
did you tried to output the qstring to the console or called qstring size to make sure all the content is stored
may be it s a limitation that comes from qtextedit or qtextdocument and not qstring



4260831
scheme racket
Pattern(s): 5	
if you install a scheme implementation i am using mit scheme edited to add that this also works with racket using mzscheme it may come with a symlink named scheme - this is what emacs looks for i think
if it doesn t mit scheme doesn t seem to on os x you can edit your emacs configuration in emacs type m-x customize-group then type scheme



4267506
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
this would probably explain why google-chrome allows the xhr but not firefox
google-chrome considers the subdomain part of the same origin but firefox does not



4270094
youtube vimeo
Pattern(s): 5	
so on the youtube side doesn t happen nothing
also it only works with youtube it does not affect vimeo flash embeds for example



4270094
youtube vimeo
Pattern(s): 5	
also it only works with youtube it does not affect vimeo flash embeds for example
ironically at the time of writing the new html5 iframe embedding from youtube doesn t work with the iphone nor with the ipad while the old flash embed still does



4305402
scheme racket
Pattern(s): 5	
both ocaml and racket plt scheme have opengl bindings
it looks like racket doesn t have sdl bindings however which may or may not be important to you



4307049
phpunit simpletest
Pattern(s): 5	
to expand on the above answer with respect to simpletest mentioned above the st system has a built in browser object class for browser automation while phpunit has an extension for the selenium browser automation the advantage of selenium vs
simpletest is that selinium will run any on-page javascript while simpletest will not



4309222
h.264 webm
Pattern(s): 1	
h.264 is a patent trap waiting to happen
probably webm if not ogg



4311582
icmp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
on 1gb hardware i see 80µs icmp latency i cannot help on 10gige or infiniband
at faster fabrics though it really depends upon what protocols you are using tcp often has more acceleration options than other protocols and hence can reach higher performance figures



4329229
interpreted-language compiled-language
Pattern(s): 3	
in c# this won t be so easy because c# is a compiled-language not an interpreted-language
in an interpreted-language it s fairly easy to parse raw-text as the language and see the results



4331653
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
as described here - one common reason to override readobject and writeobject is to serialize the data for a superclass that is not serializable itself
the state that you think you have in your subclassing instance isn t really visible to the serialization as its not going via your api or reflection



4331887
agile sprint
Pattern(s): 3	
agile doesn t mean keeping the process the same - there s always room for improvement
some people recommend that once a sprint has started there should not be a change to what stories are worked on



4334219
letter-spacing text-align
Pattern(s): 5	
the letter-spacing attribute doesn t take percent values
text-align justify won t work either because it only affects the space between words not the font kerning and it also only applies to those rows of text that are followed by another row



4350640
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 5	
for an environment to implement tail call elimination is mandatory in scheme but not in most other lisp dialects such as common lisp
i thought lisp using clisp would recognize the tail recursion



4353033
django web2py
Pattern(s): 1	
django follows explicit is better than implicit
web2py does not and instead follows everything should have a default behavior



4356675
strcpy malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
using strcpy is safe because you know all the sizes
note that malloc does not return initialized data you cannot guarantee that the last allocated byte will be zero



4356739
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
i figured out the problem - i should have been using calloc not malloc
while malloc simply allocates the memory calloc



4359477
mongodb bson
Pattern(s): 5	
of course it works with bson documents but when you want to update some record mongodb returns full bson doc not the part
i am new in mongodb but as i understand mongodb cannot returns some part of document



4359645
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
udp doesn t guarantee message delivery - if there s no place in the buffer the packet is dropped without hesitation
if you need guaranteed delivery use tcp and build a message-based communication scheme on top of tcp



4361629
memcpy strcpy
Pattern(s): 3	
memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy
in fact if you perform a strlen to identify how much you are going to memcpy then strcpy is almost certainly faster



4366624
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the third line in your for-loop isn t actually a line it s just the third expression and is terminated by the closing bracket
the reason loops continues rather than quitting is because without squiggly brackets to indicate a statement block the for-loop will only loops the single statement immediately following loops - that is the console.writeline



4386251
tabcontrol tabitem
Pattern(s): 1	
you can download snoop or other tool that shows you visual tree and see there that content of tabitem is not actually the visual child of this tabitem but the visual child of tabcontrol
so tabitem is the logical child of tabitem s content and tabcontrol is the visual child of tabitem s content



4389022
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
and it makes sure that a hash password cannot be uniquely reverse engineered
md5 is a one way hashing function which will guard your original password more or less safely



4420797
hmac md5
Pattern(s): 1	
hmac is not encryption it s actually authentication integrity but its secure when used with a reasonable hash
normally i d recommend sha-256 or better but for what you re doing md5 sounds secure enough



4445477
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
assuming your hashing method is not weak it doesn t matter if the salt is known - salt is simply so that 2 users with the same password have different hash - and a casual inspection of hash wouldn t result in identical passwords being obvious
salt should be unique per user



4460056
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
since then innodb was improved a lot
myisam was not



4468719
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
also the for-loop you use is bad in conjunction with arrays
a for in on an arrays will loops not only over indexed values but also properties and methods



4494489
winpcap jnetpcap
Pattern(s): 3	
libpcap winpcap that jnetpcap uses provides this reliably on at least windows and linux from my experience
i have experience with libpcap winpcap but not with jnetpcap



4515338
ssl https
Pattern(s): 1	
another edit as pointed out in a comment below remember that ssl tls isn t the only solution to all your site s security needs there is still a lot of other considerations but it does solve a few security issues for the users and solves them well even though there are ways to do a man-in-the-middle even with ssl tls
it is highly recommended these days to run the entire site on tls https that is if possible



4527378
fink macports
Pattern(s): 1	
because fink is reputedly more stable than macports and has many more packages
the best way to manage packages on os x is fink not macports



4555411
umask mkdir
Pattern(s): 3	
also it s best to make sure the umask is reset so that if you chmod to 0777 the parent shell s umask doesn t interfere with the umask in the script
perl s mkdir doesn t work as the shell s mkdir -p which creates intermediate directories if they do not exist



4569743
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 3	
like stdout stderr is usually directed to the output device of the standard console generally the screen
that means stderr is not redirected to stdout but they share a common file descriptor



4574238
glut sdl
Pattern(s): 3	
glut is no longer under active development that s one reason not to use it
another is that other wrappers glfw sdl are not only under active development but generally more powerful



4576122
nemerle boo
Pattern(s): 1	
boo primarily integrates with sharpdevelop while nemerle has visual studio 2008 integration
adding caas to a language like c# or even macros to boo is not nearly enough to reach nemerle s level of metaprogramming for which the language has been designed from the start



4592648
uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
uiviewcontroller or uinavigationcontroller which implement their user interface in their own viewdidload
you should create your view controllers in viewdidload of the uitabbarcontroller not in the viewdidappear



4592764
pylons pyramid
Pattern(s): 3	
but pyramid would be a better choice to learn right now as pylons is not actively developed
i started with pylons and then pyramid and found both intimidatingly complex



4625909
phpunit simpletest
Pattern(s): 1	
phpunit works fine with every continious integration server since it outputs all standard log files for code coverage and test reports
simpletest does not



4665278
free malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
so with that malloc function no your free does not free the memory
first of all you re losing the address of the memory so every time you call this malloc you re actually pushing the process break a little further and never reuse freed memory locations



4669599
groovy gsp
Pattern(s): 5	
you can of course write portlets in groovy using gorm for data access
gsp isn t currently available outside of grails so you might have to live with jsp for the views



4674702
rubygems rvm
Pattern(s): 5	
this may or may not uninstall your rubygems i m not sure
and be aware that you re just going to have to reinstall that since rvm needs ruby to run



4675973
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
if the subclassing doesn t contain all the methods of the superclass they shouldn t be related in such a way
defining b as a subclassing of a is akin to saying b will provide all the functionality that a does plus whatever else you decide to define



4719286
qtreewidget qfilesystemmodel
Pattern(s): 5	
qtreewidget is not as flexible
qfilesystemmodel has a method called setnamefilters that should do what you want



4722445
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 5	
vb6 was interpreter based language while vb.net is a compiled language
vb6 was not a type-safe language while vb.net is a type safe language



4740030
typebuilder reflection.emit
Pattern(s): 5	
typebuilder conveniently does keep track of the created runtime type for you if it has already been created
this goes for almost every reflection operation in reflection.emit types not just typebuilder



4759517
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	
whether or not all cores are in the single cpu or not makes little difference it does make some difference in caching though
anyway the processors won t do any multithreading by its own



4800138
atoi atof
Pattern(s): 5	
in your case atoi does return an int so it works correctly
atof doesn t so it doesn t work correctly



4804813
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome has a design policy that forbids you from using xmlhttprequest to load local files
firefox does not have this policy



4813040
children parent
Pattern(s): 2	
if you want to define a in the parent and allow children to use it as appropriate then you can define it within a section
by doing this the parent will not execute the plugin



4819094
subclass abstract-class
Pattern(s): 5	
here my abstract-class is baseparameter and i am replacing the stringvalue property with a different value from the subclass not shown
note that although you can rebind to the correct type the form values associated only with the subclass will not be automatically roundtripped because the modelbinder only see the properties on the base class



4821539
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
your maven project doesn t seem to be configured as a eclipse java project that is the java nature is missing the little j in the project icon
to enable this the element in your pom.xml should be jar or similar



4824748
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
first of all while the arguments object available within a function is not an arrays it is array-like enough such that an incremental for-loop is preferable - not only because it runs faster but also because it avoids other pitfalls - one of which is exactly what you re falling into
to actually answer the question of why the second loops doesn t work it s important to realize just what for .



4886354
datamapper activerecord
Pattern(s): 1	
datamapper currently doesn t support this feature but it s on the roadmap and is referred to as embedded value
activerecord supports defining embedded values already



4896539
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
if the directory does not exist or the specified language is not located there ci will instead look in your global system language folder
file folder structure is very important



4899295
uinavigationcontroller uinavigationitem
Pattern(s): 1	
dealing with uinavigationcontroller uinavigationbar uinavigationitem can be confusing but luckily apple has a decent explanation of how all these things work together at the top of its uinavigationcontroller documentation
it seems like self.navigationitem is only looked at by the uinavigationcontroller controller not bar



4905239
performselector delegation
Pattern(s): 5	
that respondstoselector performselector combo is an idiom for optional delegation methods
the delegation isn t guaranteed to have that method defined so a direct call to it would cause a compiler warning



4915145
rsa aes
Pattern(s): 5	
if you re looking for privacy rsa isn t the way to go use rsa to generate a private public pair and then use them to excahnge keys -- or exchange keys out of band
use a streaming algorithm like aes to encrypt the message



4929975
bash tcsh
Pattern(s): 2	
here s one way you can get around that using bash to interpret the escape sequences although it s a little ugly
the problem is that tcsh isn t interpreting the escape sequence in your variable name so the environment variable ends up with a literal e in it when you try to set it with tcsh



4943179
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 5	
cron jobs do not run under your user and environment
the path to wget may not be in the cron user s path



4958579
folder dir
Pattern(s): 5	
edit suposing you have saved your class in an accesible dir in a folder called applet your code should look something like this
the web-inf classes dir is not visible from the client explorer java environment which is where the applet is run so when it s trying to load your class it can t found it



4959636
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
add a protected getter method in the superclass to return the balance value such as this
this method will be visible to subclassing but not visible externally



4976962
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 1	
first you are using a very old versioning of jquery - the current versioning is three major versioning ahead
please upgrade there really isn t a lot of reasons not to



4977259
rvm bundler
Pattern(s): 5	
i hope you ve got rvm if not i strongly sugget you to install it this will allow you not only to use different versions of ruby but also to set different gemsets therefor one each project you ll find it useful
once in rails 3 you can use bundler have a look at this episode of railscasts by the way this is a very good site but you may know it already



4977633
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 3	
when the error message indicates that ttf_font is actually a typedef not a struct
the struct is actually called _ttf_font



5041799
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
use a larger signed int type such as int while doing intermediate calculations this to make sure that over- and underflows can be detected and dealt with in particular not casting to a signed type could force to compiler to promote every type to an unsigned type in which case you wouldn t be able to detect underflows later on
when assigning back to a jbyte you ll want to clamp your value to the 0-255 range convert to unsigned chars and then convert again to signed chars i m not certain the first conversion is strictly necessary but you just can t be wrong if you do both



5055680
apache lighttpd
Pattern(s): 5	
this is the correct line for apache but not the correct line for lighttpd
for lighttpd you want something like this



5070003
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
the mathjax fonts don t include u+25fb and so google-chrome is showing the missing symbol
it looks like firefox is finding the character in a different font and using that or perhaps you have stix fonts on the machine running firefox but not the one running google-chrome and mathjax is using that



5073472
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 3	
if you are new to lisp and not an emacs user presently then i would strongly recommend the free editions of either allegro lisp or lispworks
or if you are going the scheme route plt scheme which is now called racket



5084692
securitymanager classloader
Pattern(s): 3	
you can be more precise about this with a custom securitymanager which is usually a damn good indication you are doing something really dodgy
in general you can make a classloader that doesn t always delegate to its parent



5118859
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are getting compile errors not linker errors make sure libav folder reside in usr local include and you include ffmpeg headers with their folder names
you have to define usr local include as an include directory and not libav folder inside



5123755
addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
otherwise it would have to be represented by matrix addition which is more intuitive to humans but would make graphics cards even more complicated than they already are
now matrix multiplication generally isn t commutative so when adding a transformation by multiplying your matrix you need to specify whether you re left-multiplying or right-multiplying



5173263
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb enforces referential integrity
myisam does not



5177265
strcpy malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
you re getting lucky that strcpy isn t hitting anything of consequence so the program runs
malloc often allocates a few more bytes than requested to better keep memory aligned



5191896
ftp telnet
Pattern(s): 3	
ftp is typically exposed since it s less risk - ssh can be much more dangerous and i would suspect blocked if you re seeing a connection timeout message
putty is an ssh telnet client not an ftp client - different protocol different tcp port



5202741
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
but in reality if you need them to be able to deselect then you need a checkbox and not a radio button
you have two options create another radio button labelled none or something appropriate to your form that s part of the same group then they can select that instead



5228482
micro-optimization benchmarking
Pattern(s): 1	
i ll start with a warning these may be micro-optimization that aren t worth worrying about
i would perhaps consider doing performance benchmarking to see how important this is



5253775
notepad++ sublimetext
Pattern(s): 1	
on windows notepad++ does a pretty decent job another good option is aptana especially for javascript although it can be a bit heavy weight depending on the job
i ve also used sublimetext but not in any great depth and then there s microsoft expression web which is very similar to dreamweaver i thought they had a free express edition but apparently not



5269203
disk ram
Pattern(s): 1	
this use of virtual memory lets parts of programs and their data be stored on disk when not in use then brought back into ram when needed
when it is brought back into ram being virtual means that it can be put any place there s space for it rather than having to go back exactly where it came from



5297935
subclass abstract-class
Pattern(s): 5	
you can use a subclass or implementing class
interfaces and abstract-class are not concrete classes



5311776
uiview subviews
Pattern(s): 1	
this can be done for any uiview subclass not just uibuttons
looping through a uiview s subviews is an unreliable way to find a button



5330319
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp doesn t
tcp - used for traffic that you need all the data for



5332654
csla .net
Pattern(s): 1	
mobile objects through the data portal csla .net supports 1- 2- 3- and 4-tier application deployments and allows an application to switch between deployment configurations without changing existing code
abstract persistence csla .net is not an orm and does not implement mapping to databases



5464228
rtp rtcp
Pattern(s): 5	
rtp does not address resource reservation and does not guarantee quality-of-service for real-time services
the data transport is augmented by a control protocol rtcp to allow monitoring of the data delivery in a manner scalable to large multicast networks and to provide minimal control and identification functionality



5471740
libevent epoll
Pattern(s): 2	
i needed libevent to read many files regarding priorities
the problem was in epoll not in libevent



5486739
free malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
as far as malloc realloc and free are concerned memory is just a flat array of bytes
if you store pointers in memory that s you choice but malloc doesn t care



5522964
gitolite gitosis
Pattern(s): 1	
i m not sure if this will be of any help to you but it s worth noting that the successor to gitosis gitolite has built-in support for wildcard repositories documentation here
according to this blog post gitosis does not support wildcard repositories



5523339
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 3	
you can download vmplayer and ubuntu and get started really quickly
linux isn t as scary as it used to be and something like ubuntu is actually really easy to use



5532921
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
your for-loop does not terminate before the arrays is exhausted
accessing outside the arrays limits invokes undefined behaviour



5535764
avro thrift
Pattern(s): 3	
apache avro doesn t do that tagging and will save you a tiny bit more space because of that
like others have said google protocol buffers or thrift are very popular binary serialization tools



5537609
onchange onblur
Pattern(s): 5	
i used the onblur event to destroy the widget and the onchange to save by xhr the new value
the focus is below because the onblur was not working properly



5568590
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql uses the reserved word serial as a part of the ddl in that process
mysql doesn t



5570244
tlistview tlistbox
Pattern(s): 5	
while the tlistview does not expose an itemheight property the tcustommultiselectlistcontrol is also the ancestor for the tlistbox which does expose this property
the tlistbox s itemheight property is implemented in tcustomlistbox which descends from tcustommultiselectlistcontrol



5590078
nsoperationqueue nsinvocationoperation
Pattern(s): 5	
inspired by bbum s answer i found a solution that uses nsoperationqueue but not quite in the way he described
in my preloadparts function i create and store a load operation that is an instance of nsinvocationoperation that runs my background thread function



5612650
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
a directory is a kind of folder
a virtual folder is not necessarily backed by a directory



5614047
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
casting it to the superclass does not invoke the superclass method
the subclassing s method is called automatically



5615319
django-cms django-filebrowser
Pattern(s): 5	
whilst that may sound in fact like the opposite of what you want i ended up there because what i really wanted was to get django-cms working with filebrowser
without grappelli though the standard django-filebrowser does not work as expected



5629571
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
when a button element is left to the native style remove the border line-height is ignored by both browsers weirdly google-chrome also ignores the height but firefox does not
as soon as the button is custom-styled google-chrome picks up the line-height but firefox does not



5655014
wsdl2java cxf-codegen-plugin
Pattern(s): 5	
the wsdl2java documentation doesn t mention any options for specifying the java version
you could try using the maven cxf-codegen-plugin to generate the client stubs which should respect the maven compiler s source and target versions



5671202
actionscript mxml
Pattern(s): 5	
having actionscript defined in a script block in your mxml is not mixing logic with presentation
likewise mxml does not define the presentation of your project



5675900
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
at the time icon_img is evaluated in the callback passed to geocode the outer for-loop already finished and icon_img has the value of the last iteration
it works for address because it is evaluated inside loops not later



5677762
cvs svn
Pattern(s): 5	
subversion differently than cvs cannot change the content of the code coming from a commit
the svn book includes a note about this question



5709287
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	
it would be good to know what physical cpu this is but i m assuming from your phrasing about logical processors that there is 1 physical socket 2 cpu cores and hyperthreading is enabled giving you 4 logical processors
the short answer is for this complicated definition of processors no not all processors are created equal



5710475
nsurlconnection nsurlprotocol
Pattern(s): 5	
when you would like to display an iad you can send your pause notification this will cancel the nsurlconnection but not the nsurlprotocol which will remain open and loading and thus your webview will continue to appear as if it were loading
then when the add is finished you can send a resume notification much the same except in this case any active nsurlprotocol handlers receiving the notification will create new nsurlconnections using the range header to resume where they left off



5711132
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
the problem is that your code loops through all indices of the arrays using a canonical for-loop which is fine
however the body of loops uses not only the index counter but also the index plus one counter+1 which is outside the range of the indices of the arrays



5713772
tesseract tessnet2
Pattern(s): 1	
if you don t want to reinvent the wheel i suggest you use tesseract an open source ocr in c++ or tessnet2 which is a .net wrapper around it
i had the same approach as yours grayscale then thresholds etc in .net then i adapted a bit tesseract tessnet2 is a wrapper around tesseract 2.0 not 3.x which is the actual version to have a good interface for ocr output then i have good results



5754021
gif png
Pattern(s): 1	
versions of gd older than gd-1.6 support gif format images and do not support png where versions greater than gd-1.6 and less than gd-2.0.28 support png not gif
gif support was re-enabled in gd-2.0.28



5759317
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp is not a good choice for persistant connections
tcp is a much better choice



5772144
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
saying udp sucks would be quite ignorant towards a lot of programs i know that would never work with tcp and require the fast and easy data distribution of udp which cont rary to tcp also supports multicast
most of my traffic counting in gb external these days is udp based because udp does not get stuck on a lost packet and list packets can be easily requieried with a specialized higher level application level protocol



5772144
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
most of my traffic counting in gb external these days is udp based because udp does not get stuck on a lost packet and list packets can be easily requieried with a specialized higher level application level protocol
tcp has the really nasty habit of getting stuck up to 3 minutes when a packet is lost



5812916
xlib xcb
Pattern(s): 3	
in fact xcb was created precisely because xlib was too high-level masking too much underneath so it was easy to make mistakes and making it difficult or impossible to have full control
also xcb is not very old from an x perspective



5832294
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome doesn t agree about this for reasons i don t understand
i think firefox is actually doing the correct thing here



5833841
rss feed
Pattern(s): 3	
that is an xml feed rss is always xml
your issue is likely that feed isn t a real url even if safari handles it



5837942
ssl https
Pattern(s): 1	
added ssl tls uses random numbers in the client_hello and server_hello handshake messages to prevent replay attacks
https does not use public key encryption for transmitting data like http requests it is used for setting up symmetric random keys



5841194
queue fifo
Pattern(s): 1	
note that lifo queue are a good fit for singly linked lists
fifo fifo not so



5863681
swt swing
Pattern(s): 5	
by contrast swt actually uses the operating system s windows so naturally it has less memory usage and less work to do on its own
the windows in swing aren t really windows they re just made to look like windows



5870416
ienumerable icollection
Pattern(s): 5	
if calculating the number of elements is expensive they should implement only ienumerable - not icollection
because icollection exposes count as a property it should be safe to assume that it is very cheap to get its value it should not iterate through the entire collection



5886753
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
el accesses properties by getter not directly by the field
if your setter is named setemail then your getter is likely named getemail so the property name is really email not email



5889110
folder dir
Pattern(s): 5	
you will then see files and folder not referenced by the project as grayed out
if you wanted to automate this you could produce a list of all files in the project directory and subdirectories from the os using dir and redirecting the output to a file for instance and parse the project file to get a list of all files referenced by it



5951581
cvs rcs
Pattern(s): 1	
cvs not to be confused with cvsnt is a predecessor to svn
rcs is the non-networked predecessor to cvs



5978844
apache lighttpd
Pattern(s): 5	
speaking only of unix-based environments i d say that fortunately you only have to think of this if you are going to use php with apache web server in which case you are advised to go with the prefork mpm of apache which doesn t use threads and therefore php thread-safety doesn t matter and all gnu linux distributions that i know of will take that decision for you when you are installing apache + php through their package system without even prompting you for a choice
if you are going to use other webservers such as nginx or lighttpd you won t have the option to embed php into them anyway



5982355
rss feed
Pattern(s): 3	
the link to the rss feed is working properly and there is information at the address
so i started looking around and i found that the problem is with the rss not the code well the original problem



6015107
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
you are only allowed to first assign variables that are enumeration types or integral types -- int chars long etc -- inside a class definition
chars is not an integral type so you can only assign to it in global scope



6027659
haskell ocaml
Pattern(s): 5	
haskell implicitly creates selector functions for field names
ocaml doesn t do this



6046512
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
first of all md5 is a hash algorithm not an encryption algorithm.
if you really need to use the md5 algorithm i don t have any solution for you



6047005
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
one of the main performance advantages of innodb is row-level locking as opposed to table-level locking of myisam which means that multiple insert update queries against the same table won t block each other unless really necessary
however innodb does not perform well at all out of the box you really need to fine-tune your mysql configuration for your specific site



6060260
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome to not add iframe url changes in the back button history
sadly i ve found no way to force ie and firefox to replicate this so i used the ajax post approach suggested above by arun



6076849
mp3 ogg
Pattern(s): 1	
also when jumping through a file the positions aren t the same - half way through a vbr mp3 may not be half way through the song
ogg vorbis is a more advanced free music format and uses vbr as default without problem



6119232
rar zip
Pattern(s): 1	
rar not so much
zip is easy



6139683
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 1	
and std map shouldn t be compared to dictionary
std map maintains keys in sorted order because it is a balanced tree dictionary solves a different problem



6196174
return-value-optimization nrvo
Pattern(s): 5	
one possible disadvantage is that it is potentially more difficult for a compiler to perform return-value-optimization return-value-optimization with a named object
named return-value-optimization nrvo is not always as straightforward as return-value-optimization with an unnamed temporary



6200589
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
however this is a simple hash good enough for hash maps not for security
if you are looking for cryptographic hash then the issue is completely different and md5 is loosy and you ll need a library for for example a sha-2 hash



6201574
gridview detailsview
Pattern(s): 1	
so this is useful for the gridview but not for the detailsview
detailsview is singular in form as it only shows one record at a time so sorting wouldn t be beneficial to expose



6235395
erd diagram
Pattern(s): 5	
the inclusion of field names muddies this a bit - an erd shouldn t really express this information afaik
yes this is an entity relationship diagram using chen s notation



6236056
swt nebula
Pattern(s): 1	
a swt combo doesn t provide this functionality which is due to the native widgets used for combo i believe
that s why there is a widget in nebula which adds such features by internally using a table to draw the combo



6248325
floating-point fixed-point
Pattern(s): 3	
this is because ieee floating-point is stored essentially as scientific notation so range is favored over uniform precision
if it was uniform precision it would be fixed-point not floating-point.



6254431
vsto add-in
Pattern(s): 5	
1 the reg entries pointing to it or to the manifest in the case of vsto either aren t there or aren t right
2 the add-in has some prerequisite or dependency that you ve missed and since it s not there the add-in loader is just failing to load the add-in



6335921
onclick onmouseup
Pattern(s): 5	
because onclick does not work there
onmouseup do the job like not exactly the same click it works for me



6388011
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
you can think of the memory free but not released back to the operating system as your own personal cache of memory
this is all assuming of course that malloc uses sbrk at all



6393068
uiview calayer
Pattern(s): 5	
set view.layer.masklayer on an appropriate view a uiview containing the scroll view should work to something suitable a calayer with contents contentsscale contentscenter set appropriately
more of a pain since calayer does not autosize itself so your wrapper view will have to do the necessary things in -setframe -setbounds -layoutsubviews



6403884
lisp racket
Pattern(s): 3	
racket is actually unique among lisp and scheme in this kind of support but even with others the situation is still far more advanced than in non-lisp languages
lisp not lisp has a number of advantages when you re facing problems that are not well-defined



6416147
dbcontext objectcontext
Pattern(s): 5	
because of that i think that whole idea of dbcontext api was management failure
at the moment ado.net team must maintain two apis - dbcontext is not mature to replace objectcontext and it actually can t because it is just a wrapper and because of that objectcontext cannot die



6417334
oncreate findviewbyid
Pattern(s): 1	
oncreate is the right place to put them
in the constructor your object does not yet have a context so findviewbyid will not work



6421602
selecteditem selectedindex
Pattern(s): 3	
things like selectedindex are specific to the way the data is shown in the ui if you change the sort order of a datagrid then the selectedindex can change even though the selecteditem is still the same
in this particular case the selecteditem can be bound to the viewmodel but the selectedindex shouldn t



6431707
qgraphicsitem qobject
Pattern(s): 2	
since as you mentioned qgraphicsitem does not derive from qobject the complier gave you that error
you have to pass a qobject pointer to qobject_cast and qgraphicsscene itemat returns a qgraphicsitem pointer



6441178
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
i would give the parent object to the children maybe not by constructor but a setter
and if the parent is set then we are able to access its children



6469588
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
maven needs the .svn folder when doing a release
also you need to have committed all your changes and not have files directory which aren t added yet



6486144
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
i can imagine that the point of hashing that fingerprint information is storage space as the resulting hash has a fixed length
but to also use a salt doesn t make much sense to me



6496030
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
i would guess that your issues arise from the eclipse project and maven pom.xml not being in synch
i would suggest that you use the m2e plugin to keep maven and eclipse in synch



6523725
lxml libxslt
Pattern(s): 3	
an older version of lxml may work too try with
your libxslt do not have exsltmathxpathctxtregister remove it and manually install a newer version 1.1.26 should work fine



6564252
ssl https
Pattern(s): 1	
there are lots of references to this kind of issue on the microsoft support site also internet explorer file downloads over ssl do not work with the cache control headers
everyone who used file downloads on https is likely to have hit this problem with internet explorer



6626326
cassini iis
Pattern(s): 5	
however sadly cassini does not allow remote connections
you might be able to use install iis express see this link without administrative privileges



6650375
actionscript mxml
Pattern(s): 5	
when optimizing flex projects for mobile devices be sure to build your custom skins in actionscript not in mxml
since mxml is turned into as3 by the flex compiler it is not always the most performance intensive



6674721
mongodb bson
Pattern(s): 1	
mongodb s underlying storage format bson doesn t support high-percision decimals only 64-bit floating point numbers
javascript in mongodb is single-threaded and can be a bit slow



6675428
cpython pypy
Pattern(s): 1	
running pypy on cpython wouldn t help besides slowing things down terribly because the api wouldn t interact with pypy s object model it would interact with that of the cpython host environment
pypy has alpha-level support for the cpython extension api via an emulation layer called cpyext



6677840
cassini iis
Pattern(s): 5	
try iis express as an alternative for cassini that s why ms released it
as far as i know this is not possible - cassini does not support comprssion



6681876
lcds graniteds
Pattern(s): 5	
you ll need to use a server that has push technology like blazeds graniteds lcds wowza server fms etc
although blazeds and graniteds isn t true push it s long polling it should be more than adequate for 99 of all projects plus it s completely free to use



6701060
interrupt wakeup
Pattern(s): 1	
calling interrupt isn t suitable because doing so sets the interrupt flag and after a spurious wakeup the interrupt flag is not set
you can t force a spurious wakeup but to the running thread a spurious wakeup is indistinguishable from a regular wakeup the source of the event is different but the event itself is the same



6729409
cassini iis
Pattern(s): 5	
you are currently hosting under the development web service cassini which doesn t accept off machine connections
you will need to host in iis by creating an application and pointing it to the physical directory where the .svc file lives



6742554
boost stl
Pattern(s): 2	
you can use boost to do it though requires a recent c++ compiler such as msvc 2010 or gcc 4.5
sadly the stl doesn t allow you to split a string on a separator



6763673
heroku engineyard
Pattern(s): 5	
in terms of scaling heroku might not be the best choice for applications that get ton s of traffic
it s funny that engineyard has the slogan when apps grow up and this is kinda the start with heroku for free and if you app gets traffic then move to something that might be better for performance



6764627
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
the cpu certainly puts an upper limit and that is essentially the only limit on 64-bit systems
although note that current x86_64 processors do not actually let you use the entire 64-bit space



6795919
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
this way the superclass doesn t have to know what the subclassing need
each subclassing defines its own behavior



6798042
metaclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
the metaclass implementation passes this test
the metaclass is responsible for enforcing the pattern and the created class and subclassing need not be aware that they are singletons



6815409
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
this is implied by romaintaz s answer to the same question maven - skip parent project build
but just to make this explicit in the parent pom.xml it s imperative that you specify the packaging element as pom.xml and not jar or war



6830694
wadl wsdl
Pattern(s): 1	
i think wsdl is not appropriate for rest and wadl is not necessary
http exposes already what wadl could describe in a separate file



6834762
uicontrol uibutton
Pattern(s): 5	
uibutton uses the target-action design pattern through the methods inherited from uicontrol to send action messages to a target object
uibutton does not make use of the delegation design pattern



6843310
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
a file size of 2gb if represented as a 32-bit integer would appear negative though it obviously isn t
it may well mean that file sizes in posix should be treated as unsigned integers not signed



6863108
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	
as long as the connection between the browser and the cpu isn t interviened which i believe there is more risk of with a browser than a desktop application
as an alternative for the future new intel business processors deliver leading security manageability and performance



6897479
allocator stl
Pattern(s): 3	
looks like the feature of stateful allocator in stl containers is widely supported already
in most cases statefullness of the allocator does not cause trouble



6902604
uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
embedding a uitabbarcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller is not supported
apple has a careful hierarchy of container view controllers and a uitabbarcontroller must be the root of its view controller hierarchy



6917173
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
since int does not have nan and both +0 and -0 will be regarded as just 0 such a method is not really needed for functionality
the compare in double has the same effect as



6919926
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
create a for-loop and execute method a repeatedly 1000 times with the whole test data
measure the timing of loops not the sum of the single functions since timing functions can bias your result when called a lot



6955700
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
this should at least give you some pointers for choosing a maximum width that doesn t look out of place
as far as i am aware the message box doesn t have a maximum height but i imagine a similar algorithm would work nicely



6986282
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
i guess that your input_arg should be defined as a matlab int type not as a double
it seems that you cannot use a double which is a floating point type as a representation of an address in memory which is inherently an integer value



7015700
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome is apparently reads my mind.
since my success callback was part of a json object firefox couldn t find whatever default it was looking for and therefore didn t fire anything



7030652
ggplot2 lattice
Pattern(s): 1	
ggplot2 is not meant to be a general-purpose graphics tool-kit
like lattice it has a particular paradigm in mind and you use it for that purpose



7054570
uiviewcontroller uipopovercontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
so the uipopovercontroller isn t rotating the popover view that it maintains like a uiviewcontroller would
this makes sense considering that uipopovercontroller inherits from nsobject and therefore doesn t inherit the uiviewcontroller s code that handles the rotation



7083385
singleton facade
Pattern(s): 1	
a spring service with singleton scope is like a local stateless session bean it is an implementation of the session facade pattern only for applications that are not distributed
spring does make the case that in most cases services don t need to be distributed and that the distributed aspects of session facade are not as all-pervasive as j2ee made them out to be



7115277
soundpool audiotrack
Pattern(s): 1	
i like audiotrack because it gives you the ability to edit sounds at runtime by changing the frequencies of the sound and soundpool can do the same
though for your situation audiotrack doesn t seem like it would work well since playing two sounds would require two threads because audiotrack is blocking i m pretty sure



7152635
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
you are using ajax in a for-loop and pushing the newtermlist item in its success handler
since ajax is async by default loops is not going to wait for the ajax request to get completed



7162038
opera safari
Pattern(s): 3	
macosx 10.5 firefox v5 and v0.8 opera works perfectly
safari 5.0.6 doesn t work at all



7218155
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
i think innodb implements a true acid and does a lot of fsync s to save the data
and myisam is not a true acid and does less fsync s



7279650
dreamweaver fireworks
Pattern(s): 5	
dreamweaver is not an image editing tool which is why you can not save an image from it
dreamweaver is a website webpage editing tool which is why there is fireworks which was the image editing companion to dreamweaver before adobe bought out macromedia



7285149
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
no the parent does not clean up the children automatically
whenever a process terminates all of its children running or zombie are adopted by the init process



7303273
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
a salt is most typically encountered with cryptographic hash functions not encryption functions
the idea is that rather than hashing just your data a password you hash data+salt where salt is typically a randomly-generated string



7307853
liferay magnolia
Pattern(s): 5	
iirc liferay is not really using vaadin but they allow you to use vaadin in your own portlets
magnolia is betting their future on vaadin and if you read the above posts you ll know why



7333408
spaces delimiter
Pattern(s): 1	
the default of one blank spaces is not relevant here
the job opens the file for writing truncates existing file or creates a new file set the field and record delimiter then writes the same line twice using two different calls



7353337
nsdatadetector nsregularexpression
Pattern(s): 5	
the only thing that seems strange is that the nsdatadetector does not detect the same links on ipad and iphone
the only workaround you can implement if you are not satisfied with links found by apple s nsdatadetector is to remove the nstextcheckingtypephonenumber value from automaticallyaddlinksfortype and find the links on your own for example using the nsregularexpression s class



7367011
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
yes as the other answers state the getter are the same
the options retain copy and assign determine how to generate setter but not the names even of those



7378297
m2e pom.xml
Pattern(s): 2	
fix by configuring m2e to use the maven installation you are using outside or turning off offline for one build
if your pom.xml is not specific as to the version of the maven-resources-plugin that version will come from the superpom



7394142
nunit moq
Pattern(s): 3	
i think mocking socket is a fairly advanced task nunit dynamicmock isn t suited for that after all they don t pretend to be a real powerful mocking solution
i am personally using moq and since socket class isn t sealed i think mocking it with moq should be pretty straightforward and suitable for your needs



7431650
helpers actioncontroller
Pattern(s): 1	
i think the issue might be that the url_for method that you re used to calling in your views and defined on actionview as a helpers is not the same url_for method that gets called when you re in a controller
actioncontroller base has its own similar but not the same method called url_for method



7438390
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
the idea of a salt is just to make the hash digest unique per user to resist dictionary attacks and rainbow table attacks
the salt doesn t add to the strength of the hash digest algorithm regardless of the salt s length



7465411
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
salt are used with hash not ciphers
note that both ivs and salt are specific examples of a nonce



7474998
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 1	
note that you need to refer to the type as struct element not element within the definition itself since the typedef name element isn t visible yet
the fact that the struct tag and the typedef have the same name may seem confusing but it s perfectly legititimate



7515779
flowlayout jseparator
Pattern(s): 5	
the reason flowlayout doesn t show the separators at all
jseparator has a pref height of 0



7527541
ppl tbb
Pattern(s): 1	
note that namespace concurrency in vs2010 also contains apis of concurrency runtime concrt on top of which ppl is built asynchronous agents and etc
tbb does not have most of that though it has some critical_section



7544425
mef prism
Pattern(s): 1	
so mef is not the same thing as prism
prism is a ui composition framework which can be used with wpf silverlight wp7 surface and probably with c# based metro style apps for win8



7584180
apache cherokee
Pattern(s): 3	
if you plan to server push services apache is not a good choice
take a look at cherokee and nginx both work much better with php-fpm than mod_php with apache2 since you do not need cgi support only fastcgi is supported with cherokee and nginx only php



7605542
emacs gedit
Pattern(s): 2	
you d be better off identifying what gedit does that makes you want to use it instead of emacs and extending emacs to make it do that too
there can t be that much --- gedit doesn t do much. the extra features can just sit there and wait for you and you ll find it easier to locate and use them if you re comfortable in emacs-mode already



7607934
screens tablet
Pattern(s): 5	
also other android tablet phones can be used with pens even if they re technically not made to support pens but those pens are just special styluses that emulate the capacitive touch of your finger so with those devices the screens can not tell the difference between your fingers and that pen so you can not assign them different functions which is definitely not as good
as far as i know only htc supports a pen on some their android tablet please someone correct me if i m wrong i may not be up-to-date on these things



7610575
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
fgetc returns int not chars
the purpose of that is to be able to return eof and distinguish that from a chars that s read



7630695
layoutparams viewgroup
Pattern(s): 5	
the takeaway from this is that layoutparams are not parsed by the view s constructor they re parsed by another step that your code above isn t doing
the layoutinflater involves the parent viewgroup s generatelayoutparams method.



7641031
d3.js protovis
Pattern(s): 5	
you might try d3.js which doesn t support gradients out of the box but offers lower-level access to the svg element which you can use to define an svg lineargradient fill
sorry but i m pretty sure protovis has no support for gradient fills



7699482
uiview subviews
Pattern(s): 1	
either a xib interface builder view or a class that inherits from uiview are equivalent to a user control
they are ways to aggregate sub views think views and subviews - not controls



7723868
gif png
Pattern(s): 5	
however gif was not a supported image file in previous versions of ax maybe there is an error with transparency
my first suggestion is to convert the gif to png update the image in the check layout and try again



7776000
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while myisam implements table-level lock
innodb has transactions while myisam does not



7776000
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not



7776000
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes



7776000
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not



7776021
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while myisam implements table-level lock
innodb has transactions while myisam does not



7776021
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not



7776021
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes



7776021
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not



7778405
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
however this is not a cross-browser solution works in google-chrome and safari not firefox
edit i have it working with jquery now but still doesn t work for firefox which is using mediaelement s flash fallback



7811818
free malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
the reason malloc works is probably because or pulls in a declaration for malloc but not free
thus malloc is unmangled but free is mangled



7826964
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
2 the single quotation marks are mainly used because a switch statement in c always expects an int and not a string
having a chars surrounded by single quotations would return the int representation of the chars



7871006
nsmutablestring nsstring
Pattern(s): 1	
nsmutablestring nsmutablestring objects provide methods to modify the underlying array of characters they represent while nsstring does not
for example nsmutablestring exposes methods such as appendstring deletecharactersinrange insertstring replaceoccurenceswithstring etc



7896584
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb does not support hash keys only btree
myisam is infamous for being unreliable



7897716
strlen strncpy
Pattern(s): 5	
for example strlen returns the number of characters excluding the terminating null so buffers need to be one byte larger than what it returns to hold things
also strncpy does not guarantee null termination while snprintf does



7921530
skip-lists queue
Pattern(s): 1	
my tests show that a skip-lists priority queue compares favorably with a binary heap based priority queue but has one big advantage looking up an item is o log n rather than o n
and a skip-lists isn t much more difficult to implement than a binary heap



7924724
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
this web.xml should be in a folder named web-inf inside your war and the compiled java class file should be in web-inf classes
the war file should be dropped in the webapps directory not the root directory



7925461
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
more seriously any subsequent children only have a closed pipe to work with and that isn t going to help them
another problem is that the parent process doesn t close the pipe



7948964
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
your command will have created the directory structure in the current folder not the root directory of your computer which is what the missing is
the first command was right but because you are trying to create a folder in which is a protected directory you need to prefix it with sudo which is short for superuser do



7968503
web.py cheetah
Pattern(s): 3	
we definitely care about performance most of our pages render in less than 25ms but web.py isn t the bottleneck
our bottlenecks are template rendering we use cheetah which is fast enough but not other-worldly fast and database queries we cache heavily and keep the number of database queries per page to 0 or 1 and accessing our 3rd-party hotel pricing providers these are accessed when you do a search with dates we don t already have cached



7969807
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
firefox msie starting with version 9 opera konq and google-chrome support
msie8 and safari not support



7990626
rtp sip
Pattern(s): 5	
rtp isn t encapsulated into sip packets
sip is a signalling protocol



7996916
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 3	
secondly the whole point of get set accessor is so you can get and set the value without needing helper methods
thirdly and as to your problem you re creating a new instance of the class in each form hinted at by the new keyword and the value of the properties will be whatever it is initialised as on construction of the instance or not. the values of properties are not shared between different instances of the same type



7999821
gif png
Pattern(s): 3	
you can use transparent gif they are somewhat supported
transparent png however not



8005540
hash hmac
Pattern(s): 5	
assuming that the is stored alongside the final -- since the hash wouldn t be testable without it -- this scheme is quite weak
using a salt does protect against rainbow tables but a non-iterated hmac leaves this scheme weak to brute-force attacks



8005540
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
assuming that the is stored alongside the final -- since the hash wouldn t be testable without it -- this scheme is quite weak
using a salt does protect against rainbow tables but a non-iterated hmac leaves this scheme weak to brute-force attacks



8080957
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
your salt isn t following that so the hash function is probably failing completely though i m not certain
also your salt shouldn t be a constant in your app it should be unique to each user and stored in the db along with their hashed password



8099711
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
width is not a problem will work as it is
height is slightly more tricky for it to work you need to have the parent of the overlay div to have a known width



8184489
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
first this will break out of the inner for-loop not the while loops
your while loops has no termination condition



8187448
mockito unitils
Pattern(s): 1	
yeah unitils doesn t support mockito
however mockito comes with handy mock injection utility annotations



8190150
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
this is unlike lists where each for-loop would get its own iterator over the entire list
you can have an inner loops steal lines from the file so that the outer loops doesn t get to see them



8260741
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
the only thing i think of that is that you actually never start receiving the file because the server-side doesn t read the command get foobar.txt so the client-side freezes on sending the command
the existence of the file at the client-side might be from previous tests



8262666
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
no in general the hash doesn t change by move_uploaded_file somehow magically
but if you compute the md5 including the file s path the hash will certainly change if the file is move to a new path folder



8280361
maven m2e
Pattern(s): 5	
alternately you can provide a goal in the maven build configuration
now as for the warning copy-dependencies is not supported by m2e it means that m2e does not support this plugin



8297302
dbcontext objectcontext
Pattern(s): 1	
a shared dbcontext is not a good idea
since dbcontext objectcontext is not thread safe



8303765
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 2	
well the only way i could think of was to store the column values in arrays and then using for-loop to spit each value out along with their percentage
now arrays in awk are associative and are never in order i.e pulling the values out of arrays will not be in the same order as they went in



8313167
text-align height
Pattern(s): 5	
the text-align rule isn t necessary
the height rule won t apply to the button unless you specify border 0



8320343
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 1	
one approach would be to make sure that if those two jobs are separate cron jobs - there is enough time inbetween to surely cover the run of job 1
another approach is locking as others here suggested but then note that cron will not re-run your job just because it completed unsuccessfully because of a lock



8331291
crypt md5
Pattern(s): 1	
unix md5 crypt doesn t use plain md5
that would be insecure because plain md5 is fast and password hash should be slow



8353812
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
pom.xml is a maven build configuration file
if you are not using maven adding a pom.xml will not help



8363525
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
so until you specify the width the div s width will not shrink down to the image
your div is set to 100 height which is in relation to its container height not its contents



8368998
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 5	
therefore multiple sudo calls are also not a problem
the passwd is not read from the standard input but from the current terminal



8381893
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
if there width is not defined then use css overflow and a simple tutorial available here
for example your content div have not prediction about width height then use overflow



8398478
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 2	
be sure to let sudo only run specific commands without passwd not all
you can configure sudo to be usable with no passwd as described here



8404141
oncreate getwritabledatabase
Pattern(s): 5	
you will need to ensure the sqlite database user-version is set to the current version after you copy the file from assets to ensure that oncreate is not called upon subsequent calls to your getwritabledatabase implementation
you shouldn t really be overriding getwritabledatabase and calling the superclass method in that way



8404631
fadein hide
Pattern(s): 1	
jquery adds fadein hide and other effects to it s effect s queue
so it s calling .load instantly just after it sends the hide to the effect s queue and the hide isn t completed



8419066
margin height
Pattern(s): 1	
you need the positive bottom margin to make sure the div s don t overlap
for the second fieldset you ll need to give it an even bigger negative margin but if you know the number of divs and can give them a set height it shouldn t matter too much



8433855
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
think of it this way an instance of a subclassing is also an instance of the superclass
but an instance of the superclass is not necessarily an instance of the subclassing



8433855
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
but an instance of the superclass is not necessarily an instance of the subclassing
thus the superclass methods are always available in both but the subclassing methods are only available in the subclassing



8445789
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
since the return value of read is actually a chars you cannot use it directly as an int you would need to parse it from chars to int
but assuming that you want a number that is longer than one digit then you really need to use console.readline instead and convert the input to an int using int.tryparse



8449950
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
only google-chrome currently supports sending binary object types
firefox does not yet support sending binary types



8512805
viewdidload viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 1	
if you ve already loaded that viewcontroller or added it to a tab bar controller or whatever then viewdidload will not be called again - this is only called once when your view controller has finished loading its views from a nib or manually
to update a view when it is presented by another controller viewwillappear is the standard method to use though this won t be called if you are swapping views the way you do in your question



8547903
cpu affinity
Pattern(s): 3	
with a query that doesn t end up blocking on resources on a 4-core machine you theoretically get a 4-times speed up 4 hyper-threaded might give you more or even less but probably not 8-times since hyperthreading s doubling of some parts of the cpu doesn t give a clear two-times increase
with the same query on a single-core or with processors affinity meaning only one core is available a webserver in web-garden mode then there s no speed-up



8547903
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 3	
with a query that doesn t end up blocking on resources on a 4-core machine you theoretically get a 4-times speed up 4 hyper-threaded might give you more or even less but probably not 8-times since hyperthreading s doubling of some parts of the cpu doesn t give a clear two-times increase
with the same query on a single-core or with processors affinity meaning only one core is available a webserver in web-garden mode then there s no speed-up



8554731
int double
Pattern(s): 2	
the problem is not that you can t convert a double to an int round accomplishes that just fine it s that you re trying to do division on an int padlength - length string
the error message is just telling you that int is not an instance of fractional the typeclass for numbers that can be divided



8569245
bash zsh
Pattern(s): 1	
the main incompatible change between sh and zsh is that an unquoted parameter substitution undergoes field splitting and filename generation globbing in sh and ksh and bash but not in zsh
in zsh always expands to a single word unless var is an array variable here ls -l whereas in sh would expand to the two words ls l-



8591608
spotify last.fm
Pattern(s): 1	
spotify doesn t really provide access to the currently playing song so what you re attempting to do is probably not really feasible
i would suggest maybe using something like last.fm to save overall playcounts



8595187
ienumerable icollection
Pattern(s): 1	
icollection collectionbase and ienumerable aren t directly instantiable types
collectionbase icollection is a base class interface that is inherited implemented by any class that considers itself a collection and holds multiple items



8659386
vala genie
Pattern(s): 5	
converting from vala to genie is a bit more complicated since the vala.codewriter class in libvala only outputs vala not genie
it would probably be possible to create something which outputs genie by subclassing vala.codevisitor just like vala.codewriter does but nobody has done so yet



8674687
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
if a method in a superclass refers to a particular field static or otherwise of that class only that class s declaration of the field will be in scope at that point
any fields static or otherwise of subclassing will not be in scope



8704345
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
rather it is to point out that often times a simple for-loop does not perform that poorly
while it often results in a massive speedup to eliminate for loops and take advantage of numpy built-ins vectorization



8715966
phpunit simpletest
Pattern(s): 1	
phpunit works fine with every continuous integration server since it outputs all standard log files for code coverage and test reports
simpletest does not



8736369
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
quoting is different mysql uses backticks for quoting identifiers whereas postgresql uses double quotes
like is case insensitive in mysql but not in postgresql



8736838
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
i used the same code written in this question which worked in firefox and safari but not in google-chrome
in google-chrome it didn t play again



8781026
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
in other words the hash algorithm doesn t really matter as much as system security and limiting login attempts also if you don t use ssl then the attacker can just listen in on the connection to get the information
unless you need the algorithm to take a long time to compute for your own purposes then sha-256 or sha-512 with a user specific salt should be enough



8801023
codeigniter kohana
Pattern(s): 1	
codeigniter has different class naming
all codeigniter classes begin with ci_ while kohana doesn t use any prefixes



8806188
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
your for-loop is not particularly bad because you loops only n times but do work each loops
since you re doing a lot of work each iteration loops penalty doesn t hit as hard



8812119
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 2	
try google-chrome to see the effect
nothing as far as i know firefox doesn t support those yet



8869795
qunit sinon
Pattern(s): 5	
its cause qunit doesn t have spies or mocks
but you can use the sinon mocking framework



8886805
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 5	
but pay attention in case you use that init script to start up the fastcgi daemons do not use any init tools like service monoserve start rhel centos or rcmonoserve start
for me this will not work i suspect the init systemd will spawn another process with different environment variables



8910048
knitr latex
Pattern(s): 1	
if you do have spaces knitr will be able to produce the output with the long lines wrapped with so will sweave i think if you set
this is a difficult and extreme case because you do not have spaces among those a s so latex may not be able to wrap the words



8920598
filesystems hfs+
Pattern(s): 5	
the lack of case sensitivity is due to the filesystems you are using hfs+ not the perl functions -e and open nor the underlying stat 2 and open 2 system calls
the hfs+ filesystems is not case sensitive by default



8925017
filesystems fat
Pattern(s): 3	
different filesystems not different operating systems have different capabilities for storing metadata
ntfs has plenty of possibilities while fat is very limited and ext are somewhere in between



8925017
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 5	
different filesystems not different operating systems have different capabilities for storing metadata
ntfs has plenty of possibilities while fat is very limited and ext are somewhere in between



8980076
winpcap libpcap
Pattern(s): 1	
thus no clr-language wrapper around winpcap will be able to read pcap-ng files until such a winpcap release comes out
in addition the libpcap winpcap api currently doesn t return time stamps with nanosecond resolution so even if you did read a file with nanosecond-resolutions time stamp with libpcap you wouldn t see nanosecond-resolution time stamps



8984779
junit jmock
Pattern(s): 5	
one more thing you don t need to set the fields in the test class to null junit flushes the instance for every test
jmock isn t thread safe



9003139
unsigned short
Pattern(s): 1	
you cast it to char that is an unsigned value discarding the negative sign if there is one a narrowing conversion
then converting to short is not bringing back the negative sign if there was one



9036366
cassini iis
Pattern(s): 1	
a little reading asp.net dev server cassini iis express and multiple threads
the asp.net dev server cassini cannot handle multiple threads



9045335
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
other dbmss like postgresql have non-redundant enums so the following might not really apply to your situation
mysql enums cannot be applied in every situation anyway



9087899
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 1	
use g++ not gcc
gcc is a c compiler whereas g++ is a c++ compiler



9093506
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
you pass in the root folder and backup destination and it finds all folder tests if it is a mercurial repo looking for a .hg directory and clones the repo to the backup destination
if the folder is not a mercurial repo then it does the recursion itself



9105666
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
your script seems to be working in google-chrome but not in firefox
the error i am getting in firefox is position unavailable meaning probably that firefox s location service doesn t have access to my wifi network



9108421
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
also tobytearray only dumps the value of the int it doesn t include any der encoding information to identify it as an int of whatever length
also in c# byte and chars are different things with different sizes



9149751
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 2	
you re probably still receiving emails because you re only redirecting stdout but not stderr
to redirect stderr to dev null use



9150803
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
use calloc to allocate memory with zeros
malloc is not guaranteed to zero the memory



9161257
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to store a hash that will be secure for a long time to come sha-256 or sha-512 part of the sha-2 family of hash designed as secure replacements for sha-1 are a good choice and somewhere between 128 and 256 bits of salt are standard
however the use of plain hash is not the best way to do this nowadays



9189168
free malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
malloc keeps track of the memory that is free or not
in general malloc cannot return this arbitrary region of the heap to the os because the heap is a single contiguous region from the os point of view



9194355
junit jmock
Pattern(s): 5	
jmock depends upon hamcrest and junit uses and includes some hamcrest classes in it s jar so this is probably where the problem comes from
the easiest fix is to use the version of junit which doesn t have the hamcrest libraries included junit-dep



9257048
nstimer nsrunloop
Pattern(s): 5	
once you ve invalidated an nstimer you shouldn t use it again
instead create a new timer instance and use that instance to add to the nsrunloop s addtimer method



9279107
nhibernate automapper
Pattern(s): 1	
the reason why nhibernate isn t updating the customeraddress object referenced by customer.addresses is because the address variable gets overwritten with a new object in the call to the mapper.map method
automapper creates a new customeraddress object which isn t associated to the retrieved customer hence nothing gets updated when you call session.save



9370706
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
create at least one package to wrap your source because when jars are exported the src folder isn t included
so if you create your own default package then you ll have some defined root directory to base your resource paths on



9400244
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
if you use a service reference to generate your client-side proxy be sure to check reuse types in referenced assemblies when generating the proxy
the class and object you created server-side doesn t exist client-side



9418146
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
if you have data that needs to be retrieved but under no circumstances should ever be changed use a getter but not a setter
if you have data that needs to be set for internal purposes and should never be publicly exposed and cannot be set at instantiation use a setter but not a getter setter presumably prevents a second call affecting the internal property



9429163
imei cellid
Pattern(s): 1	
imei is a global unique number which used to identify your phone but not possible for location
i believe what you re looking for is cellid but not imei



9430846
vbscript jscript
Pattern(s): 5	
for scripting a dynamic property can be any legal jscript or microsoft visual basic scripting edition vbscript statement. says msdn
jscript is not javascript



9435179
strlen strtok
Pattern(s): 5	
strlen doesn t work on non-null terminated chars
also note that strtok modifies the string in the process of tokenizing



9437893
vim textmate
Pattern(s): 1	
fyi vim exhibits the same behaviour
textmate doesn t do syntax-checking at all



9440133
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 3	
cron jobs are only installed onto the application master instance
when your application master fails and a failover occurs the cron jobs do not automatically transfer to the promoted instance



9450549
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
however for a cipher algorithm that is not based on hash a salt isn t necessary because the attackers will obtain anyway the original string with the salt and it s just needed logic to remove it
a salt is a sequence of characters added to a string about to being hashed so it s harder for an attacker to obtain the original string



9452939
bindparam pdostatement
Pattern(s): 5	
pdostatement bindparam requires a reference and potentially modifies the argument that was passed to it converts it to the most appropriate type or writes the result to it if it s an out inout parameter
pdostatement bindvalue doesn t take a reference and doesn t modify the argument



9452939
bindparam bindvalue
Pattern(s): 5	
pdostatement bindparam requires a reference and potentially modifies the argument that was passed to it converts it to the most appropriate type or writes the result to it if it s an out inout parameter
pdostatement bindvalue doesn t take a reference and doesn t modify the argument



9452939
pdostatement bindvalue
Pattern(s): 5	
pdostatement bindparam requires a reference and potentially modifies the argument that was passed to it converts it to the most appropriate type or writes the result to it if it s an out inout parameter
pdostatement bindvalue doesn t take a reference and doesn t modify the argument



9462159
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while myisam implements table-level lock
innodb has transactions while myisam does not



9462159
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not



9462159
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes



9462159
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not



9486406
moq moles
Pattern(s): 1	
in other words moq is not going to be any help to you here
for mocking statics i use a tool called moles which is free



9528832
ready each
Pattern(s): 5	
i dont know what are you trying to achieve you didn t disabled the button by default so enabling them at the dom ready doesn t make sense i must be missing something but from the code you have provided and what i understood from it if you modify the markup as
notice that the ids are now unique and i have applied the class send to each send button also i have taken the send button inside the form



9543611
octal decimal
Pattern(s): 1	
these escape sequences originated in c or maybe in c s predecessors b and bcpl in the days when computers like the pdp-7 ruled the earth and much programming was done in assembly or directly in machine code and octal was the preferred number base for writing instruction codes and there was no unicode just ascii so three octal digits were sufficient to represent the entire character set
by the time unicode and java came along octal had pretty much given way to hexadecimal as the preferred number base when decimal just wouldn t do



9559081
super self
Pattern(s): 3	
also two comments on your other code there s no point overriding the __init__ method if you re just calling the parent method but if you do need to that you should use super as i have done here rather than using the name of the superclass itself
self doesn t exist in that scope - it only exists inside a method and only then because it s passed as the first parameter



9595562
gtk pygobject
Pattern(s): 3	
since pygobject binding is virtually the same than the c api because the introspection technology i suggest to use gtkcellrenderer present in gtk
apparently gtk does not have any class called gtkgenericcellrenderer is pygtk exclusive



9600058
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 1	
the best and much more secure way is to sudo visudo and attach nopasswd to get sudo not require a passwd
the way in the middle is using the sudo -s parameter that expect the passwd coming from standard input instead that from the terminal device



9610065
redhat fedora
Pattern(s): 3	
redhat has traditionally had better virtualization support in its enterprise offerings
but fedora is not that



9610415
hash salt
Pattern(s): 2	
the two append something to or otherwise modify the input password not including salt to give the resulting hash
if indeed you have the md5 hash values using the method you describe piping a string to md5sum that resulting hash cannot be reversed to anything you can then hash to an htpasswd compatible hash



9635881
qtp loadrunner
Pattern(s): 1	
if you look at qtp based gui virtual users then you are looking at a sinngle virtual user per os instance
your statement i think loadrunner does not run browsers and only sends recorded data when you look at both the full firefox stack in the truclient user type as well as the ability to run gui virtual users operating against whatever browser you choose pretty much causes this statement to be set aside



9646965
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 5	
if the properties accessor doesn t match the ivar it will return nil
of course if you re manually implementing the accessor check your code there



9647787
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
the salt determines how much space is required to store a pre-computed table such as a rainbow table that allows an attacker to quickly lookup a password for a given hash
the number of hash iterations not the salt is what determines the time required for an attacker try each password in his dictionary of candidates



9647787
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
the number of hash iterations not the salt is what determines the time required for an attacker try each password in his dictionary of candidates
every bit of salt doubles the space required for the lookup table



9652662
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
depending on what query you make like queries that match at the beginning of the column may use indices in postgresql i know for sure that they do
in mysql i m not sure



9662859
jwindow jdialog
Pattern(s): 1	
contents of jwindow is accesible only if its parent is displayed on the screen
for editable and accesible contents use un_decorated jdialog instead of jwindow jdialog doesn t caused non_accesible contents



9674034
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
remove all children and they become orphaned and deleted but the parent is still around
now you have the problem that the children cannot be orphaned because the foreign key is not nullable



9693000
freebsd linux
Pattern(s): 5	
freebsd has an emulation afaik but i don t know if you can access it natively
if you want to target other platforms than linux you cannot use futex



9716563
ssl ntlm
Pattern(s): 1	
my guess is that ntlm authentication fails due to ssl connections not being persistent
ntlm scheme requires multiple message exchanges and can function with persistent connections only



9725977
findstr tasklist
Pattern(s): 1	
the skip 2 option would skip the first two lines output from findstr not tasklist
since the regular expression won t match anything in the first two lines output from tasklist you re safe to remove the skip option



9729770
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 1	
strictly speaking funcall would not be needed but there are some lisp list-2 implementations such as common lisp that separate the variable name space of the function name space
list-1 implementations scheme do not make this distinction



9741159
lsp principles
Pattern(s): 1	
i think you have mixed up the direction of lsp liskov substitution principles lsp is strong behavioral subtyping not strong behavioral supertyping
so lsp is not working against your example but for your example



9745679
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 3	
automatic upgrade are performed only if you increase the versioning
if you modify the package and keep the same versioning older packages with the same versioning cannot be removed automatically



9770974
vb6 vba
Pattern(s): 2	
also vba does not have forms right so you will need to understand how the vb6 gui forms archetecture works
whether you are learning vb6 to maintain existing vb6 or migrate it to .net or other more modern language you should try to come up to speed on standard object-oriented methodology



9774195
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
if it is false the body of loops does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement past the for-loop
after the body of the for-loop executes the flow of control jumps back up to the update statement



9790057
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
loops here actually works by next method of cursor object as in calling second_collection_records.next until second_collection_records raised stopiteration exception in python generator and for-loop stopiteration is caught and code inside for-loop would not be executed
so in the second til last loops of first_collection_records second_collection_records.next actually raised stopiteration for the inner loops not executing the code



9791321
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 5	
finally simply having a reader present on the stdout is not going to be enough
you need to actively be reading from it and from stderr to prevent the process from hanging if it writes too much output



9823788
javassist cglib
Pattern(s): 5	
the class engineering api is ok but javassist is not perfect either
in particular the proxyfactory which is the equivalent of the cglib s enhancer suffer from some drawbacks too just to list a few



9841043
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
then find a good measure to set the width not necessarily the same as the string s length
if you find a container that has the right height just grab its height and update the other elements



9874120
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
yes it would work because a chars is implicitly convertible to an int
i think the answer is yes this is permitted and will work because an int is 32 bits and a chars is 8 bits. this is wrong an int is not always 32 bits



9918572
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
whoever tells you postgresql is not fast enough for writing does not know it
whoever tells you that mysql is not scalable enough does not know it facebook runs on mysql



9929829
sctp udp
Pattern(s): 1	
sctp is message-oriented like udp and ensures reliable in-sequence transport of messages with congestion control like tcp
sctp is not yet widely used



9951705
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
setting up https in apache isn t too hard and then just use modproxy to send requests internally to your play application
any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used it with https



9966174
mspec moles
Pattern(s): 3	
moling mspec is basically not possible
moles is not capable of detouring anonymous methods



9990747
swt swing
Pattern(s): 5	
if you re using swt have a look at this
unless explicitly otherwise stated in the javadocs swing components assuming you re talking about swing are not thread-safe



9993386
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are saying that the arrays is empty because the for-loop was not entered it is probably because your integer i is not initialized
therefor it contains some garbage value which was likely higher than the value of self.arrayquattro.count making it appear that the arrays was empty hopped over the for-loop



10001580
base-class derived-class
Pattern(s): 5	
if your base-class doesn t have a default constructor because you ve provided one or more constructors that take parameters and no constructor that doesn t then it s a compile-error for a derived-class constructor not to indicate the base-class constructor it calls.
if your base-class has a default constructor a constructor that takes no parameters



10029603
updatepanel scriptmanager
Pattern(s): 3	
2 make sure the updatepanel aren t interfering by turning off the ajax updatepanel functionality
you can do this by setting enablepartialrendering to false on your scriptmanager which is usually located on the masterpage



10037463
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 5	
typedef does not create types in c but creates alias names for existing types
struct my_struct is a name of a type my_struct is a tag name and not a type



10091806
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
as you will see the message handler is called in firefox but not google-chrome
this is not working on any google-chrome i tested so far



10094403
directwrite direct2d
Pattern(s): 2	
directwrite doesn t actually require direct2d and can be used on its own idwritebitmaprendertarget
it s just much much easier to use direct2d to render directwrite text into an iwicbitmap via id2d1factory createwicbitmaprendertarget and then draw that bitmap using dx maybe by copying to a dx surface or using some shared surface approach



10114381
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
hint udp does not have connections so you don t have a listener socket
for tcp you open a listener socket on which connections can be accepted



10115216
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
md5 does not encrypt a password it hash it
a hash is a one-way function that takes a given input and creates a predictable output that is a given input will always have the same output ideally such that even very similar inputs will yield vastly different outputs



10116707
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
as it is now anything but an int would result in an infinite loop
in getnextline you have a while loop at the end that say get chars from file while chars is not newline



10162011
passenger webrick
Pattern(s): 1	
phusion passenger is a full fledged rails server
when it is used webrick is not involved



10175756
cpython pypy
Pattern(s): 1	
the real speed difference comes from the fact that unlike cpython which is interpreting whole program as bytecode pypy uses just-in-time jit compilation into machine code for rpython parts
pypy isn t python interpreter implemented in python it s python interpreter and compiler implemented in rpython which is a restricted statically typed subset of python



10217018
dbcontext objectcontext
Pattern(s): 5	
it discovers entity sets based on dbset properties defined on the dbcontext derived class or in general it discovers your model based on your code
objectcontext does not do any discovery and is not convention based



10228199
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
note the parent should not have knowledge about the specific children in a good oo-design
this ensures that you can create new children later say child3 without having to change parent



10264503
.htaccess httpd.conf
Pattern(s): 5	
i believe the issue is that allowoverride is set to none for the web directory you are using which means the .htaccess will not be processed
you will have to edit httpd.conf and set allowoverride all



10265852
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
please note that older version of svn use to create a hidden .svn folder in all folder not only in the root folder or direct subfolders
you could also do an export command to create a full non-versioned copy in a target directory to avoid the manual delete of .svn folder



10267807
salt md5
Pattern(s): 5	
regarding the question sha1 with salt works fine for most use-cases unless you write software for the cia or such
the point is that even salted md5 -hash isn t worth to get cracked on most sites



10291625
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
body in which case the for-loop would execute the i++ before re-evaluating the condition and the while loops would not
it s a regular for-loop that does nothing at all in the initialization step



10306650
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
and you ll be fine as long as int do not overflow
you are unnecessarily using double s not to mention math.pow isn t the most effective and straightforward way to compute the power of 2



10308655
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as



10308655
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does



10308655
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not



10363117
scheme racket
Pattern(s): 5	
scheme is defined by a standard
racket isn t



10368506
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
what you are adjusting automatically is the width and not the height
the height is something you ll have to adjust manually based on the maximum font size you will use



10369039
textview imageview
Pattern(s): 5	
so it would be logical that you touching somewhere on your activity such as your textview would trigger this image rotation thing
my best guess seeing your code would be this it would be best to implement a touch click event listener for your imageview itself not for your whole activity



10379026
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
swift is not much friendly with macros
complex macros are used in c and objective-c but have no counterpart



10387713
junit testng
Pattern(s): 3	
i suspect what you re trying to do will be easy with testng - junit does not have the grouping capability that testng does
i always recommend that people switch to testng which is just like junit 4 except with more functionality



10407941
int chars
Pattern(s): 2	
also note that when you assign an int to a signed type that cannot hold that value you are invoking undefined behaviour
so assigning 128 to a signed chars that cannot hold 128 when 128 is greater than char_max is invoking undefined behaviour



10429195
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
doctrine2 uses innodb which supports foreign keys used in doctrine associations
but as myisam does not support this yet you can not use myisam to manage doctrine entities



10434147
free malloc
Pattern(s): 2	
then you are correct in thinking that without a destructor the memory allocated by malloc will not be free
if you follow the rules above then you need to use free not to deallocate it



10436253
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 1	
that s very interesting as google-chrome isn t anything special on pc
in fact on my windows 7 pc safari is my tertiary browser behind maxthon-3 operates like ie but better and opera 1-key window cycling and page resize beats all



10442638
cppcheck coverity
Pattern(s): 5	
afaik cppcheck does not provide accurate parsing or symbol table definitions so its error checking can t be both deep and correct
i think coverity and fortify offer something along these lines using the edg front end



10467702
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
i m using so that the final int does not need to be followed by a semicolon or end-of-line
it looks like the skipper is being applied when checking the semicolon and so the skip chars including newline have already been consumed once is reached



10499458
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
from the blog post it seems it is buggy in safari so maybe google-chrome has not implemented it yet
i m unable to activate that experiment myself there s no developer tools experiments in my google-chrome flags but from safari i found this explanation



10518317
bitblt gdi
Pattern(s): 1	
see gdi vsync to avoid tearing though getting things down to a single small bitblt may be good enough for some cases
also note that it appears that gdi bitblt isn t synchronized with screen vsync



10527259
viewdidload viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 3	
first of all viewdidload will not be called so you can remove it from here
both viewwillappear and viewdidappear will be called so you only need it one of these 2 methods



10534904
range min
Pattern(s): 5	
so if i 3 then i-min is 1 the range after adding the delta is 2 3 4 modulo 4 yielding 2 3 0 so adding the min gives us 4 5 2
generate a random number up to n-1 and add it on modulo the original range shifting because the min is not 0



10604271
mkdir pwd
Pattern(s): 1	
the second mkdir doesn t want the
also pwd is a built-in variable



10604601
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
alternatively you could use an arrays that is actually 3x2 instead of 4x3 then fix your for-loop to use indexing that matches
the declaration of your arrays is not correct it s 4x3 instead of 3x2



10615995
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
get button back and hide it by adding display none style add client side onclientclick event call this button s click event using javascript
yes because of event bubbling controls like checkbox cannot fire itemcommand event



10633193
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp does not guarantee data delivery could be lost so i would use udp multicast for device discovery and open up a tcp connection for data that requires guaranteed delivery
tcp listening port can be advertised via udp multicast so that everyone can connect with each other over tcp



10668256
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
if you didnot copied you plist from resource folder to document directory then first copy it there and then try to access it
first check whether your plist file exist in document directory or not



10669778
coalesce isnull
Pattern(s): 3	
coalesce function works a bit different coalesce will take any number of parameters and return the first non- null value i prefer coalesce over isnull cause
meets ansi standarts while isnull does not



10678494
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
beyond that the rules and guidelines for abstract-class interfaces and general superclass are the same
any class interface which is being subclassing will not be resolved through magento factory methods



10680485
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
method java.util.arraylist.add int java.lang.object is not applicable
actual argument double cannot be converted to int by method invocation conversion



10684001
pthreads fork
Pattern(s): 5	
from the pthreads spec section you quote above
the reference to create handles using fork isn t elaborated on further in this section but the spec for fork adds a little detail



10690755
realloc calloc
Pattern(s): 1	
do not free ptr if realloc is successful
some folks may point out that in some esoteric systems calloc may not do what you expect specifically for pointer and floating point types



10702338
decimal ieee
Pattern(s): 5	
decimal cannot use the fpu
you get best performance with float or real which map to a standard ieee floating point number which is supported by the fpu



10710895
docx .doc
Pattern(s): 1	
this answer is specific to docx though it looks like you might be sending .doc - not sure whether you are committed to that where there are two ways you can handle html
the first is to create an altchunk alternative format input part containing the html which word can process when the docx is first opened



10759027
git-status git-add
Pattern(s): 5	
git-status is your friend
note git-add does not add files to the repository



10771280
range minimum
Pattern(s): 3	
a larger range is quite useful
the standard specifies minimum ranges not the precise range itself



10776329
multicastdelegate delegation
Pattern(s): 5	
given any delegation type one may fairly easily write a class which will combine delegation which are of either that type or a derived type and yield a combined delegation which will do just about everything a multicastdelegate can do and a number of things it can t
the only thing that style of combined delegation would not be able to do is have its subcomponents taken out by delegate.remove since that function would just regard the combined delegation as a unit



10796652
mouseup mousedown
Pattern(s): 3	
the problem is that you click on the text your current target is the text now it means mousedown event is already fired inside the text area and it s waiting for mouseup event to be fired in order to complete a click event
however you drag cursor out of the text and release mouse outside the text area and your current target now is the button not the text anymore mouseup event doesn t fire inside text area but inside button area so click event won t happen



10800833
agda ats
Pattern(s): 1	
agda is not designed to be a general-purpose programming language
ats is a dependently-typed language that is designed for low-level programming though it s somewhat less elegant than agda



10801252
primefaces richfaces
Pattern(s): 3	
standard jsf and primefaces does not support request based el evaluation in attributes
richfaces is the only who supports that



10801846
do.call lapply
Pattern(s): 5	
lapply is similar to map do.call is not
lapply applies a function to all elements of a list do.call calls a function where all the function arguments are in a list



10803241
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
and yes using innodb makes a difference
if you were using for instance myisam you wouldn t have transactions at all so any change will be permanent similarly to autocommit true



10804408
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
i suspect that you have some oop background so i won t go too much into subclassing other than to say a subclassing is very often a specialized or more specific version of the superclass
in other words every subclassing is a kind of its superclass but every superclass is not necessarily a type of subclassing



10817661
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the reason is that the variable i is defined as a chars not an int but it is possible for the two to be cast implicitly
so the reason why you are getting strange chars returned is because casting a chars to an int has resulted in an index value that probably does not exist in your string



10842047
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
maven doesn t support any sort of list or way to store several properties tags inside one tag
however you don t need to duplicate the plugin configuration you can just move it entirely into the profiles and not have it defined in the main pom.xml at all alternate still remove it from the main pom.xml but make an activebydefault profile which has the default plugin configuration



10853162
geocoding geocode
Pattern(s): 3	
geocoding is notoriously littered with icky humanity
the consensus is that google s reverse geocode is not sophisticated enough to report intersections in one query



10857757
xlwt xlutils
Pattern(s): 5	
xlutils can use xlrd and xlwt to copy a spreadsheet and appending to a to be written worksheet is straightforward
i don t think reading the open spreadsheet is a problem -- but xlwt will not write to the open book sheet



10864646
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
also i should note that in same cases you don t have to do a copy even when realloc increases the size for example if the next block in the heap is free
malloc does not initialize memory to zero



10906635
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 2	
otherwise maven will not know where to find your source code
it is possible to configure a pom.xml to tell maven to expect your source code to be in different source folders but it is highly recommended that you follow the standard maven directory structure



10923649
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
if you do need to be informed of the children completing then the signal handler needs to be set to reap all possible processes
if your parent process doesn t need to be aware of its children s completion status then you can just set



10979106
qthread qtcpserver
Pattern(s): 3	
qthread is not derived from
qtcpserver is only derived to access the socket handle



10981828
mousemove mouseenter
Pattern(s): 1	
you could even trigger the mouseenter event on mousemove as long as you include some kind of flag state-check to ensure your mouseenter code doesn t get executed repeatedly on mousemove
jquery s mousemove method is a nice solution here as it does get triggered when the mouse is rolled into an element as you scroll even while the mouse has remained static



11018269
bash subshell
Pattern(s): 3	
bash doesn t have threads and processes don t share memory
and subshell are still different processes - they inherit their state from their parent but they have no shared data with them



11044973
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
ie and firefox implement the spec correctly by putting the properties on the prototype
chrome and safari do not they put the properties directly on the object



11057475
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
firefox is even slower that google-chrome
so even if you get to run smoothly your animation in google-chrome is not garanteed it will do smooth on other browsers or slower machines



11094704
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
a struct with two int and one chars is not necessarily will take 4+4+2 10 bytes consecutively there may be internal padding
however this struct with two int only doesn t use internal padding



11120348
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
afaik cgi-bin folder is mostly configured to hold executable scripts
this directory should not contains any directly accessed non-executable files like pdf in your example



11154644
int chars
Pattern(s): 2	
the size attribute accepts only int not percents
it represents the maximum number of allowed chars to be typed in the input



11157350
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
it would appear that google-chrome will fire the click and context menu events as the op is expecting.
but ie and firefox do not which is more the behaviour i would expect



11159716
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 3	
however the public bar is and it has two accessor - get which just as the example above getbar returns the private member and also a set - which corresponds to the setbar string value method in the forementioned example
starting with c# 3.0 and above the compiler became optimized to the point where such properties do not need to have the private member as their source



11164824
box-sizing border-box
Pattern(s): 5	
if you check box-sizing is set to content-box
changing it to border-box doesn t change the positioning of the text



11167187
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
code that relies on the trick does not work in google-chrome because google-chrome does not support the inline processing of xml within javascript
this is a perk of firefox which supports e4x while google-chrome doesn t



11183585
qtp loadrunner
Pattern(s): 5	
afaik generally qtp is not used for load testing though it is possible to measure transaction time for a business scenario using start and end transaction.you can execute qtp scripts which would in-turn be a part of the load testing.but to go deep into load testing you need to use other load testing tools like hp loadrunner
it is obvious as both tools qtp loadrunner are from hp this also signifies according to hp for load testing you should use different testing tool both tool can be use together for load testing



11185448
ocean petrel
Pattern(s): 5	
there is a problem here ocean api allows you to create a propertydatafilter1d from a propertyversion whereas native filters in petrel are created from a property
and ocean doesn t expose any reference to the petrel property



11200659
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
rolling your own salt is not a problem and knowing them by this i assume you meant store them separately to the hash is not necessary if you re storing crypt s output as-is
from my investigation it seemed that the salt is always 22 characters and the hash offset is 29 not 28 making it 31 characters in length not 32



11207164
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
but the a modifier solution i provided is more efficient since it uses a simple for-loop and doesn t have to execute a command using for f
you have a classic problem for batch newbies - you can t look at a value you just set within a loops parentheses because the entire loops is parsed at once



11218233
free malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
i don t know if getline will try to call free or not when it dynamically grows the buffer
if it does then the malloc one is very preferable.



11240968
qgraphicsview qgraphicsscene
Pattern(s): 2	
i have done a similar thing to use a qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview to display items in a model
despite it s name qgraphicsview isn t part of the model view framework so i implemented a custom view class which drew the model data on the qgraphicsscene



11243999
haskell agda
Pattern(s): 5	
haskell unlike agda does not have dependent types so there is no way to do exactly what you want
types cannot be parameterized by value since haskell enforces a phase distinction between runtime and compile time



11245313
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 3	
innodb creates indices automatically for foreign keys
myisam does not support foreign keys at all



11279273
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
in this case your superclass is not meant to throw an exception
this is a case where your subclassing is thus throwing an exception which is not expected by the overlying software architecture



11282002
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
realize that maven is not magic
and that if you are going to use maven and eclipse everything has to be driven by the pom.xml file not the other way around



11316458
exif jfif
Pattern(s): 5	
exif is another container format identical to tiff as far as structure but it defines new tags expressly for metadata which means you can trivially wrap a tiff as an exif and it s still a legal tiff and with a bit of sneakiness you can also wrap a jfif as an exif in a way that s not quite a legal jfif but almost all software accepts it anyway
exif is the only common way to add metadata to jfif not counting dcf which is basically the same thing as exif but it s one of multiple different ways to add metadata to tiff



11326372
onchange onkeyup
Pattern(s): 3	
onchange occurs only when you blur the textbox
onkeyup onkeypress doesn t always occur on text change



11341332
nunit nsubstitute
Pattern(s): 5	
there was also another strange symptom though a new unit test that i had written using nunit mocking with nsubstitute wouldn t pass because nsubstitute wasn t returning what i wanted it to return
i lost a few minutes trying to figure out if i did something wrong programming nsubstitute then when i tried to attach the debugger to the nunit gui i saw that warning



11344149
vbscript jscript
Pattern(s): 3	
asp vbscript doesn t understand the concept of timezones just what the current server time is
jscript asp does and luckily enough you can mix and match your scripting languages in asp



11349905
junit powermockito
Pattern(s): 1	
for testing frameworks junit is the standard unit testing framework
note that the frameworks mockito and powermockito are not testing frameworks themselves but they can be used within junit



11350136
portrait landscape
Pattern(s): 1	
first i think there s a typo in your question -- on a 640x960 display 640 wide is portrait mode not landscape
portrait is vertical landscape is horizontal



11428258
floyd-warshall dijkstra
Pattern(s): 5	
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v|3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|
also dijkstra s cannot be used for negative weights we use bellmann ford for the same



11443795
nsstring nsdata
Pattern(s): 5	
the methods to measure and draw strings are methods on nsstring not the graphics context as in other systems
the method to save the data is a method on nsdata not a file class



11480994
red-black-tree 2-3-4-tree
Pattern(s): 1	
rb-tree red-black-tree is not isomorphic to 2-3-4-tree
because the 3-node in 2-3-4-tree can be lean left or right if we try to map this 3-node to a rb-tree



11484916
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the solution is either to alter your schema to make that column store int or alter your query to cast the column
the column is being stored as chars data not int notice that the it thinks the one that starts with 99 is highest even if there is a 111



11530218
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 3	
yes - it s stable and it has much much better performance than apache if configured properly of course
no nginx is not compatible with apache - configuration is completely different



11543761
caanimation nsanimation
Pattern(s): 5	
but caanimation is always working fast and nsanimation may slowing if cpu is too busy
if you need to get window screenshot later as example to make transition animation between two window states the core animated views view with caanimation may not been grabbed



11571647
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
now the final apk size is 486kb and files from libs folder are not included
this happens because you keep your modules in the directory named libs which is by default designed for the native libraries usually .so files



11574915
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
this should help you sort string items in a datatable as int using c#
it looks like your seqnbr column is of type string so it gets sorted by chars and not as numbers



11580112
webkit blink
Pattern(s): 5	
then of course it will work only in webkit and not in firefox - add them with -moz prefix as well
also remove the quotes around blink to leave it just.



11595647
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 5	
without the tag you are typedef -ing a tagless struct
you need to provide the tag for your struct not only a typedef



11603395
uicontrol uibutton
Pattern(s): 5	
if uicontrol doesn t do what you want you ll need to roll your own event management
uibutton is a subclass of uicontrol



11609264
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 1	
you save memory by not creating new comparator objects and comparator is useful if you are comparing objects of different types which is not your case
your listdata object should implements comparable not comparator interface



11622152
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
sqlite is for local site and postgresql is very populare but i think it s just a choice
if you want to use mysql it isn t a problem

mybb vbulletin
Pattern(s): 5	
mybb does not have any working seo plugin at the moment afaik
vbulletin has vbseo plugin which is developed and manteined by professionists.

folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
assuming the folder aren t visible to your users give each user gallery a guid
then create a directory path using the first 3 characters of the guid like so



11662022
junit testng
Pattern(s): 5	
as far as i know junit does not support the behaviour that you want
you might want to take a look at testng which allows test specific setup with beforemethod and aftermethod annotations



11671483
ember.js backbone.js
Pattern(s): 5	
ember.js is 42k minified+gzip while backbone.js is just 5.6kb
ember.js packs a lot of power in it which the barebones backbone.js doesn t give you



11693395
ontouchevent ondraw
Pattern(s): 5	
it is getting stuck because ontouchevent operates in ui thread so as ondraw
so you are blocking your ui thread in while loop and ondraw doesn t get processor time



11700961
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
since copying full folder isn t build in - you should write your own function to do so
make new directory that ll store copies of the files function mkdir



11710868
swt windowbuilder
Pattern(s): 2	
eclipse uses the standard widget toolkit swt not included in jre by default netbeans uses swing included
since recent eclipse versions it includes windowbuilder to create swing or swt via drag n drop



11730665
uiview subviews
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem here is that the uiview doesn t own its uiviewcontroller
in the first block of code you held the uiview around by adding it to a subviews but let the uiviewcontroller go away



11744417
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 5	
and when you do as dorien says be sure that your cron jobs are setup properly
tagclouds can get out of sync if you re cron jobs aren t firing often enough



11753896
maven-assembly-plugin maven-jar-plugin
Pattern(s): 3	
you have to tell maven-assembly-plugin not to include the base directory within the archive which can be achieved by using the following
and the suggestion about using maven-jar-plugin is very good cause it looks a little bit that you are misusing the maven-assembly-plugin



11786294
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem is that your children don t receive reference to the parent
in the build_subtree method you re creating parent without saving it to the db but the add method saves objects to the db and there is not fk to set because parent does not exist yet



11808944
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
the .css getter does not retrieve .style propeties it retrieves getcomputedstyle or .currentstyle in ie
so it is not symmetric with the .css setter which sets .style properties on the element



11855228
temporary tablespace
Pattern(s): 5	
there is a temporary tablespace called temp which is used internally by database for operations like distinct joins etc
since my query which has 4 joins fetches almost 50 million records the temp tablespace does not have that much space to occupy all data



11869634
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
innodb has crash recovery built into the storage engine s initialization
myisam does not



11895699
atof strtod
Pattern(s): 1	
meanwhile atof is not locale-aware
the language specification does not require atof strtod to recognize locale-specific number formats for locales other than c locale



11902218
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
what you posted works fine in google-chrome and safari but doesn t do a thing in firefox
where it dies in firefox is the inclusion of a background image



11908392
qscrollarea qtextedit
Pattern(s): 5	
i don t agree with the idea that a qscrollarea isn t much use on its own
the qtextedit answer solves the problem the developer was facing - but only because it so happens the question is really about that



11937185
centos linux
Pattern(s): 3	
this is definitely amazon linux centos based not ubuntu
another hint is that the default username in amazon linux is usually ec2-user while in ubuntu it is ubuntu at least if you use the default stock ami



11943339
msdeploy webdeploy
Pattern(s): 5	
the web publishing pipeline the msbuild stack on top of webdeploy doesn t support passing in custom rules to msdeploy which rules out using wpp
webdeploy msdeploy v3 supports adding an app_offline.htm file during deployment but it has two limitations for your purpose



12008463
rss feed
Pattern(s): 1	
rss feed not outputting properly causing your site not to show the right information improper tag use or unescaped characters
may not be updated right away i know a few feed that update on a weekly basis



12019904
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 2	
the example of a for-loop that you give is not the usual way of using for loops in python because the for-loop is not a numerical construct as it is in most languages but a way of applying a loops body to each element yielded by iteration of the collection given
the normal way using a loops to find the index would be



12059546
selecteditem selectedindex
Pattern(s): 3	
after debugging when the field is added back to the list of fields it still retains the previous selecteditem value - and then the combobox s selectedindex is immediately set to -1
preventing this in the setter for formfield.selectedoperator and by trying selecteditem selectedindex doesn t help



12072919
screens hdpi
Pattern(s): 5	
well android adjust its screens density according to device it working on if you have both folders hdpi and mdpi available it will take near best suitable resources for your application
please check whether device is hdpi or not



12076317
next except
Pattern(s): 5	
the next docpara isn t working like i would expect
now the code works except i still don t go to the next paragraph



12081372
menhir ocamlyacc
Pattern(s): 5	
the key here is that menhir allows a rule to be parameterized with a as in the line above where i ve got junk in a rule meaning match junk 0 or more times
ocamlyacc doesn t seem to allow that



12082396
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp doesn t care and thus sends less packets
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code



12098951
content-length content-type
Pattern(s): 5	
the most common quirks with ie9 that often do not bother web browsers are mismatches in content-length well this did bother safari last time i looked possibly content-type this acts in reverse - ie9 sometimes correctly gleans html mimetype even if the content-type is wrong connection close
so yes it could be a problem with http pipelining specifically if you pipeline a request with invalid content-length and not even chunked-transfer-encoding ie might wait for the request to finish



12101094
clang llvm
Pattern(s): 5	
clang though also based on llvm does not support cuda
2016-05-01 update clang now supports cuda



12130888
accessor superclass
Pattern(s): 5	
however when the superclass viewdidload method sets the properties the method invokes the subclassing s accessor which set the value of the subclassing s private _avar variable and not the superclass s
so that explains why you see the superclass value not changing



12148128
mocha sinon
Pattern(s): 1	
mocha itself doesn t provide mock stub spy type functionality
sinon is a popular library that does



12187180
uninstall upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
an example of this is if a product s uninstall sequence is broken so that the uninstall doesn t complete but goes into rollback
then i patch with a minor upgrade to fix the error in the installed product and then uninstall it



12190604
uiview subviews
Pattern(s): 5	
you should be doing it as a uiview not a uiviewcontroller
the general rule in ios development is that view controllers take up the entire screen and views are used for subviews that take up part of the screen though this is less the case for ipad



12198850
subclass abstract-class
Pattern(s): 1	
you can make it not abstract or create a subclass that invokes super on your abstract-class
although abstract-class cannot be used to instantiate objects they can be used to create object references because java s approach to run-time polymorphism is implements through the use of superclass references



12237842
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
assigning -1 to an unsigned integer is a common trick to set it to the largest value it can hold
unsigned is not a qualifier like static extern const or inline



12258446
ingres mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
firebird and ingres will give you a very rock-solid relational solution
mysql i wouldn t recommend because you are really tying everything to one app only that can write to the db sql mode soup means relations are basically a private api instead of the public api they are in postgresql firebird and ingres and this means less flexibility down the road



12258446
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
mysql i wouldn t recommend because you are really tying everything to one app only that can write to the db sql mode soup means relations are basically a private api instead of the public api they are in postgresql firebird and ingres and this means less flexibility down the road
however with postgresql you get a top-notch extensible development platform in a box



12265317
width margin
Pattern(s): 5	
simply put when you want an image to go to 100 of the monitor then you need to put it into a container with width as 100 and margin auto not fixed width and no position at all
you will see if you increase the width of the fiddle box then the image automatically increases width without having any scroll bar



12282599
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
internet explorer and google-chrome automatically make global variables for dom elements with id values
firefox doesn t because no standard says it should and it s a goofy idea anyway



12284419
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
the reason you re seeing similar initial output from nextdouble given similar seeds is that because the computation of the next int only involves a multiplication and addition the magnitude of the next int is not much affected by differences in the lower bits
calculation of the next double involves computing a large int based on the seed and dividing it by another constant large int and the magnitude of the result is mostly affected by the magnitude of the int



12288365
textarea textbox
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to maintain the linebreaks use a textarea and set the display to none
elements with the type of hidden and textbox so not have line breaks they will be removed when you set the value



12307701
textview imageview
Pattern(s): 1	
you can also display one textview and display a small next arrow like so
a linearlayout and separate imageview is not strictly necessary



12319839
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
when processing audio the cpu feeds the sound device with samples by putting them either in a hardware buffer on the sound card or in the ram
the sound processors does not get its data directly from the cpu instead it reads the samples from one of these two buffers



12324627
rcurl libcurl
Pattern(s): 5	
rcurl is an r package that provides a wrapper for the libcurl c library libcurl not the libcurl command-line tool libcurl
rcurl greatly simplifies the process of interfacing r programs with web services and provides simple functions to perform common http calls such as post and get



12347246
packets multicast
Pattern(s): 2	
the traditional solution to this is to create an igmp packets yourself which would allow multicast to work via a switch but not on the local machine
unfortunately this needs access to send raw ip packets not tcp or udp and chrome.socket doesn t provide that



12422218
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
secondly malloc does not initialize the memory allocated while calloc initializes the allocated memory to zero
calloc allocates a memory area the length will be the product of its parameters



12450667
pthreads fcntl
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are not afraid of dying processes and deadlock of whole system and processes are related - you could use python s semaphores they are pthreads named semaphores.
the page you linked as related question fcntl does not saying that fcntl is not suitable for inter thread locking



12452222
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 1	
in ios the next and previous button do not work for checkbox
the reason may just be that there isn t really a keyboard way of handling checkbox that was intuitive enough



12462053
clang llvm
Pattern(s): 1	
in fact in the clang compiler it plays a major role but that s entirely internal - what comes out of clang is pure native arm ios machine code
llvm is not a virtual machine in that sense of the word



12465713
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
finding the original value from a hash function is in general not possible
md5 is not an encryption



12502166
viewmodel caliburn.micro
Pattern(s): 2	
i ve made the assumption here that the viewmodel you re binding are true viewmodel not usercontrols and that you have separate views usercontrols that caliburn.micro is binding for you
the caliburn binding for a tabcontrol is easiest if you have a conductor that you bind by convention set the datacontext to the conductor instance and name the tabcontrol items . the issue here is that a tabcontrol instantiates a single content presenter that is shared by all tabs but you need to somehow tell caliburn.micro to find the view for the viewmodel when it changes the content



12533649
onchange onfocus
Pattern(s): 5	
if the value of an element is changed via script then your onchange will not be triggered
in such cases you need to save the value onfocus and check the value onblur and trigger onchange manually



12546654
pygtk pygobject
Pattern(s): 5	
gedit 3 uses gtk 3 which means that it uses pygobject not pygtk
pygtk was the python bindings for gtk 2



12553101
jslint jshint
Pattern(s): 5	
jslint does not support this you ll have to just ignore it
the community fork called jshint has an option called validthis which can suppress the warnings in cases like yours



12571621
rvm bundler
Pattern(s): 5	
you could uninstall the newer version s of bundler though this is a crappy way to deal with the issue or since you re using rvm just create a gemset for rails 3.0.1
note this requires that bundler not be in your global gemset for the ruby version you re trying to use



12574349
division multiplication
Pattern(s): 5	
i know that most of us grew up with the idea that division is sloooooow and must be avoided
however division unlike multiplication will not overflow



12599696
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 3	
first off you ll want tcp streams not udp datagrams
datagrams are limited in size and udp is inherently unreliable



12613994
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
since you posted your create table statements the problem is now totally obvious - only innodb supports foreign key constraints in mysql
myisam does not yet



12616144
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
you cant call any other method in for-loop because loops doesn t wait for until the work is finished
in your code you re calling geocode method in for-loop that is wrong



12626496
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
does work in ie8 opera google-chrome but not in firefox 14
firefox has a problem with



12632419
winpcap libpcap
Pattern(s): 3	
it uses libpcap winpcap so that it can work on linux and os x and bsd and solaris and hp-ux and aix and tru64 unix and irix and so on as well as on windows if winpcap is installed so on os x and bsd it ultimately uses bpf.
libpcap winpcap doesn t except on linux allow you to capture on all interfaces with one handle



12651036
ssl https
Pattern(s): 5	
data transferred over ssl will not be cached by the visitor s browser instead will be downloaded each time a page is loaded
using ssl https is recommended if a page contains sensitive data personal data or offers interactions like contact forms etc



12679917
fread strcpy
Pattern(s): 1	
a probable cause for the behaviour is that strcpy requires the source string to be null terminated which is not the case here as fread does not append a null terminator for you nor could it in this case as fread is reading the exact buffer size
strcpy also appends a null terminator which means the strcpy call will definitely be writing beyond the buffer



12686116
padrino ruby-on-rails
Pattern(s): 5	
sinatra and padrino are not automatically faster than ruby-on-rails
they are just smaller than ruby-on-rails and supply the developer with a smaller more focussed toolkit



12759559
box-sizing margin
Pattern(s): 3	
for more information about the css box-sizing property go there
you problem occurs because when you fixed the width for instance at 100px the box with its border will have a width of 100px due to the box-sizing property so your increase of margin is not compensated by a shrinking of the box which occurs when you do not set its width



12764515
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
your while loops is not equivalent to the for-loop
the for-loop is equivalent to



12773876
packets multicast
Pattern(s): 2	
broadcast packets are intended for all hosts on the ethernet to see and multicast packets are intended for all hosts in the address s multicast group to see
normally an ethernet adapter would ignore packets that aren t sent to its ethernet address to the broadcast ethernet address or to a multicast address for which it s configured to receive packets



12780476
notepad++ sublimetext
Pattern(s): 3	
notepad++ is also not great at detecting it but when you know the encoding you can set it manually
sublimetext is as far as i know best at detecting the encoding also in large files



12835140
factors matrix
Pattern(s): 3	
if your code is slow this probably means that your factors is not that sparse sparse anymore
you need to make sure that your matrix is properly reordered to minimize the fill added non-zero entries during sparse factorization



12843558
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
i tried several tests of google-chrome v ie9 and google-chrome would not work under any configuration with the root password set
i also tested firefox it also worked fine the issue is only with google-chrome



12851435
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
if instead of the double i pass an int not much changes but that significantly
i have looked at the generated code for many variations of types and count of arguments passed to printf and consistently the first double or promoted float arguments are passed in xmmn and the integer int chars long regardless of signedness are passed in esi edx ecx r8d r9d and then the stack



12858484
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 5	
so maybe the answer is that it s c++ code and the fact they compiled the objects with gcc not g++ made you think it was c code
if they only link with g++ then adding preprocessor checks and extern c is useless that only affects preprocessing and compilation at the linking stage that s already done



12867428
cpython pypy
Pattern(s): 5	
cpython s reference counting scheme for memory management arguably has more predictable performance impacts than pypy s various gc systems although this isn t necessarily true of all pure gc strategies
pypy does not yet fully support python 3.x although that is an active work item



12913535
ecobertura eclemma
Pattern(s): 1	
no idea whether ecobertura has the same issue though
one factor may be that eclemma does not measure coverage correctly for exception handling code - it may tell you that code is not covered when in fact it is executed if you step through with the debugger the code is indeed executed



12928516
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the break within for-loop breaks the for-loop not while
so the while loops continues infinitely



12938579
mongodump mongoimport
Pattern(s): 1	
mongodump will not contain the indexes but does contain the system.indexes collection so mongorestore can rebuild the indexes when you restore the bson file
the bson file is the actual data whereas mongoexport mongoimport are not type-safe so it could be anything techically speaking



12952211
ubuntu mint
Pattern(s): 5	
linux mint is an operating system based on the linux distribution ubuntu
linux mint adds many features that baseline ubuntu does not have



12952211
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 5	
linux mint is an operating system based on the linux distribution ubuntu
linux mint adds many features that baseline ubuntu does not have



12975190
configobj configparser
Pattern(s): 1	
configparser seemed cumbersome to me maybe even dare i say it unpythonic and with configobj i encountered an esoteric problem with lists i d prefer to be able to align them vertically since mine get really long and it didn t help that the latest version was published more than two years ago
the api of configparser however looked as spiffy as that of configobj albeit not as feature-rich and when we move to python 3 i can probably switch to the built-in version easily



12987916
matplotlib scipy
Pattern(s): 5	
matplotlib has a number of dependencies among them numpy which it imports under the common alias np
scipy is not a dependency of matplotlib



13018455
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 3	
you definitely shouldn t use it to call methods that have side effects because properties accessor aren t expected to have side effects
a properties is just a promise that the class implements certain methods



13038245
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
you might need a different view on deserialization and not just on serializable and that would be a jackson 2.0 feature - supported by spring 3.2 and backported into spring 3.1
using a view on serializable only is a feature since jackson 1.4



13043056
viewdidload viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 1	
is not allocating and returning the controller returning an already created controller viewdidload will not be called
in viewdidappear it is safe to adjust the views related to your controller



13049628
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
the runtime is complaining about an invalid pointer which indicates that the pointer you are passing to realloc is not a pointer that was created with a call to malloc or to calloc
it knows because whenever you do a malloc there is a memory management header that is part of the data area and the pointer you are given is a pointer to allocated memory after the header



13051170
memcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 5	
memcpy does not check for 0 and so is faster
matthew when you already know the length of the string you are copying you don t need strcpy or strncpy which check each character looking for the 0 at the end



13053274
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
10k files inside a single folder is not a problem on ext4
it should have the dir_index option enabled by default which indexes directory content using a btree-like structure to prevent performance issues



13054335
opera firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
i added a hidden text field which worked in firefox but not opera
opera forgets the hidden field values but not text field ones so i wrapped the text field in a display none div which remembers the value ok but javascript fires before the formfield has its value updated by the opera browser



13054742
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 3	
you should use settimeout instead of setinterval as setinterval will not stop until you stop it using clearinterval or by unloading the page
at the other hand settimeout will run only once for each loop with delay of 6000ms



13073710
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
your last for-loop doesn t print the last element in the arrays
if the arrays has only one element it won t print anything at all



13079078
opera safari
Pattern(s): 2	
edit it does come with enough information to know it is an ipad i myself have a project that matches ipad in the user-agent string and works for google-chrome safari and i don t have opera to test right now but i guess it works too anecdotal on no complaints
safari is not the only browser in the apple devices



13102542
qhash qvector
Pattern(s): 1	
qhash doesn t offer random selection
if you have to perform this operation often then copy pointers to the keys of the hash table into a vector or qvector get a random index into that and use the key to look up the value in the qhash



13125231
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
with your structure you re also violating an important oo design rule the parent does not know about its children and it does not interact with its children
the children override functionality of the parent not the other way around



13128674
gcov gprof
Pattern(s): 1	
to get line execution count use gcov not gprof
gprof is statistical profiling it will check where is your program running 100 times per second and gcov is coverage utility with per-basic block granularity exactly what you need



13154077
thin unicorn
Pattern(s): 3	
for example to implement rolling restarts in mongrel and thin you need quite a lot of steps in your deployment scripts
unicorn doesn t require as many steps but still significantly



13154422
uiview subviews
Pattern(s): 3	
i had subclassed uiview added it inside uiscrollview and the gesture recognizers of my subclassed uiview s subviews were not firing - except for the ones that were initially visible as before any scrolling
the simple fix was to add the uiview s subviews directly to the uiscrollview instead of my subclassed uiview



13183747
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 1	
maybe the shell used by the daemons does not recognize the construct
perhaps when run from a deamon the systemd command is using a different shell than the one used when you are running as yourself



13205311
strtod strtok
Pattern(s): 2	
the 220.44 in your example you are best using strtod to get the first number and then skip the comma and repeat
you can use sscanf or strtod strtok is not necessary



13244402
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
because children removed from the parent list are no longer in it merge cannot be cascaded to them and any changes in them are never persisted to the database
as others pointed out orphan removal will allow for any children not in the list to be deleted on merge



13247601
memcpy realloc
Pattern(s): 3	
calling it twice for contraction and expansion or calling malloc-new memcpy free-old is very unlikely to be as efficient though as with all optimisations you should measure don t guess
keep in mind that realloc doesn t necessarily have to copy your memory at all



13247861
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam



13259359
monkeyrunner androidviewclient
Pattern(s): 5	
there are also cases where androidviewclient provides workarounds for know monkeyrunner bugs see this example
androidviewclient while not faster because it relies on the same protocol as hierarchyviewer may provide a simpler alternative to write tests



13259411
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 1	
safari also doesn t apply it but interestingly it does if you go on to press a key on the keyboard. in firefox however the hover class is applied immediately
since chrome and firefox were the only two i initially tested with i thought this was a bug in chrome



13270503
pop-up dialog
Pattern(s): 5	
the responsibility of displaying the pop-up should not be the viewmodel s responsibility but a service that takes care of it for you
if the pop-up window is a modal like window like a file open dialog file save dialog message box ok cancel or yes no etc then i believe that a service would be the right choice



13276564
tabcontrol tabitem
Pattern(s): 5	
this case had to be fixed in the tabcontrol itself because tests showed when the fake visility is set for the first time the tabitem does not have access to it s tabcontrol yet
because of that i also used a attached property for the tabcontrol which corrects this issue



13319200
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the issue is that the primary key is int and not chars so when you do a select it does
if you want to have both digits and special chars try changing the column type to varchar or chars



13320472
ddms adb
Pattern(s): 1	
you can also turn off data through eclipse via the emulator control section in ddms by putting in unregistered denied to the data drop down
you could always put the device into airplane mode that will still allow you to connect over adb but not give the emulator a connection to the internet



13325659
free realloc
Pattern(s): 5	
if you don t care about the content the standard idiom is to do free followed by malloc
finding a block is cheaper than copying it and there is no guarantee that realloc doesn t do some searching of its own



13339605
ubuntu mint
Pattern(s): 3	
also my suggestion to you is to tag this question with ubuntu not mint
mint is not just ubuntu-like it is actually built on ubuntu so you should be able to find the answer pretty easy for that



13339917
wav aiff
Pattern(s): 3	
the wavwriter from alvas and the wavefilewriter from naudio are both designed to create wav files not aiff files
naudio does not incude an aifffilewriter and i don t know about alvas but aiff files are not commonly used on windows platforms



13362093
128bit 64bit
Pattern(s): 2	
no decimal is 128bit to start with
also note that running on a 64bit computer doesn t necessarily mean you re running the 64bit clr



13371329
pygtk pygobject
Pattern(s): 5	
what does matter is that the first example is using pygtk which is gtk2 and the second is using pygobject which is gtk3
since gtk3 is using gobject introspection with python some of the magic that was manually maintained in pygtk is not there



13381090
tcpdf fpdf
Pattern(s): 1	
tcpdf supports transactions multicell and utf-8
fpdf does not support good multicells



13388310
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
while this is certainly easier and arguably more readable to use than a for-loop keep in mind that it will perform no better than using a for-loop it s just hiding loops from you
the equal method for arrays isn t overridden from the default object implementation that just compares the references of the objects which aren t equal



13391239
margin height
Pattern(s): 5	
also see outer element margin not equal to inner element margin
the box s height doesn t reflect the child #menu s margins because they are both normal box elements and if the #page-content had margins they would overlap the #menu s margins in which case the header s height would include some part of the content s height which wouldn t make sense



13407535
awt swing
Pattern(s): 5	
if you need to modify swing components from threads other than the awt event dispatch thread use
swing is not thread-safe



13409241
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
on my machine with no tel handler google-chrome simply does nothing ie9 says some content or files on this webpage require a program that you don t have installed
reasonable and firefox says firefox doesn t know how to open this address because the protocol tel isn t associated with any program



13496434
division modulo
Pattern(s): 5	
second your algorithm is trial division not the sieve of eratosthenes and will have time complexity o n 2 instead of o n log log n
the modulo gives the game away



13501360
rsa aes
Pattern(s): 1	
rsa is not intended for bulk data encryption
instead use a symmetric cipher like aes to encrypt your large string



13522918
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 5	
this inline does not necessarily mean the usual macro style inlining
the macro style inlining is decided by compiler and the programmer doesn t have much control over it



13534900
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
note if the folder was already tracked you can untrack it with
i have struggled with the same problem and learned that the the command must be run in the parent folder and that the ignored directory can not be a sub directory



13541711
memmove malloc
Pattern(s): 2	
note that you can use memmove to perform the copy instead of the for-loop
also note that the cast of the return value of malloc is not required and should be avoided



13553740
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
a signed integer can represent negative numbers
unsigned cannot



13559935
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
if the superclass does not contain any default constructor the compiler will provide its own default constructor
no its not necessary to have a argument constructor in superclass if subclassing contains argument constructor



13585357
strdup strncpy
Pattern(s): 3	
i suspect strdup is actually the most appropriate for what you are doing you seem to want to allocate new memory for the duplicated string
strcpy and strncpy do not allocate new memory



13585364
cpu affinity
Pattern(s): 1	
use irq affinity to set other cpus to handle all interrupts so that your isolated cpu will not receive any interrupts
use cpu affinity to fix your specific task to the isolated cpu



13603859
strtok fread
Pattern(s): 5	
strtok requires its input string to be null terminated
fread does not append the null terminator nor does it have any room to in the posted code and buffer is not initialized



13629348
macports homebrew
Pattern(s): 2	
your configuration of macports was not built with libvpx
try uninstalling ffmpeg and using homebrew to install the package instead of macports



13631396
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
your for-loop doesn t actually do anything useful
at the start of loops you do and then immediately check to see if otherwise you just exit loops



13658118
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
cpu usually supports some sort of methods to disable interrupts for example x86 processors provide two special instructions - cli disable interrupts and sti enable interrups
if cpu doesn t provide such facilities interrupts usually can be disabled on side of interrupt controller too i belive that it is a case for different risc processors



13658554
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
this is how you iterate on the elements of an arrays using a for-loop do not use a for...in loops on arrays if you ever get tempted
your arrays is called results.genres here



13659233
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 1	
the key here is using the serializable to write an anonymous object that includes only the desired properties
note that readjson is left unimplemented - i am assuming that deserialization is not required at this stage



13668722
vim emacs
Pattern(s): 3	
but emacs is not vim they have different ideas behind both
vim is just a text editor with programming extensions it s not a place for terminal inside just as for tetris and m-x doctor



13689722
portrait landscape
Pattern(s): 3	
just because you perceive it as landscape doesn t mean it s actually not rotated portrait
in short draw your splash screens as if they are portrait but draw them sideways



13702505
public protected
Pattern(s): 5	
in c++ you can consider that public inherited implies a subtyping relationship or you could be more restrictive and consider as subtyping only the cases where the overrides of virtual functions ensure respecting the lsp
and considering that private or protected inherited doesn t but still is a case of subclassing is sane whatever constraints you put or not on virtual function overrides



13789620
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
then in your superclass s static usesubclass method you can iterate through that list of subclassing instances find the particular one you care about maybe specified by some argument and then do something with it
in general you cannot do that from a superclass and shouldn t



13802548
vbscript vba
Pattern(s): 1	
for exact details on the differences between the two see info visual basic for applications features not in vbscript and info vbscript features not in visual basic for applications
vba has a built-in ide and debugger which you don t have when running code under wsh but you can use visual sudio to debug the script file



13820622
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
it s height not width
since width is typically smaller you are likely to have a buffer overrun



13828321
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
for an ideal password hash a leak of the hash is nothing hugely critical
if the salt is not exposed then it s effectively impossible to recover a password



13831203
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
unless you avoid that problem by having dummy head node so that the empty list contains one node n with and in that case you don t actually want to print the dummy at all and can use a genuine for-loop just put the above condition back into loops statement
the following re-arranged loops doesn t look too terrible



13836253
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
i m not sure what you mean with switching from php but let the development language generate the hash not the database system
the salt should be different for every password a global salt cannot fulfill it s purpose



13837311
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
for postgresql i do not know
for mysql please see the load xml syntax docs



13842310
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
the definitions of i can be done in the beginning of the main function because the for-loop has not closure
so when loops ends the i var is still available



13850682
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
this is telling the security class to hash your password with the default algorithm and to use the salt configured in security.salt
if the value of security.salt is different in either application the hash will not match



13877041
polarssl botan
Pattern(s): 5	
if you look at the grand picture the real alternatives as an ssl library are botan polarssl mozilla nss wolf and gnutls
all except botan are not c++ specific so they do not have nice c++ objects and resource management



13881688
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
also your example is wrong on one point sizeof int isn t always 4
in the example you re showing here what you do will be safe on almost all modern cpus iff the initial chars pointer is correctly aligned



13891924
popupwindow dialog
Pattern(s): 3	
i give up using popupwindow and use dialog instead after some tests i found dialog is far better than popupwindow there are quite a few problems with popupwindow
a webview in popupwindow does not respond to long press on some versions of android and if does it crashes



13895699
next except
Pattern(s): 5	
all in all consider the flow of your program in order to determine what happens next not what to skip
you cannot do that except using goto which is taboo and should not do that



13902616
scrypt salt
Pattern(s): 5	
scrypt isn t
if you use bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 the salt is part of the hash you get so no you don t have to worry about storing it separately



13915359
ienumerable icollection
Pattern(s): 1	
ienumerable is fine that can t alter the collection
icollection is not



13982430
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
a long or any int value cannot handle decimal points so if you have a number 0 x 1 when the decimal is chopped off you re left with 0
you re using unsigned long when you should be using float or double to do division



13993216
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
client-side validation isn t a security measure it s just a better user experience
server-side validation is the only real validation



14006236
subclass superclass
Pattern(s): 5	
if the subclass s version of initializeinstance was the one that was used by the subclass when calling then the subclasses integer would be 10
this proves the initializeinstance method of the superclass was not overridden at least within the scope of the superclass by the subclass s version



14017089
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql has a native boolean type where true is represented by the string literal t and false by f there are other literals but those are the most common ones
mysql doesn t have a native boolean type and uses c-style integers for booleans instead



14024272
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to reconnect the web page in other words make your browser send another request to server with window.location.reload or some other method standard play.libs.comet.ondisconnected handler is of no use to you - its domain is a server-side not a client-side
to make your client-side manage possible blackouts by itself you may need to implement heartbeat scheme



14038388
hex binary
Pattern(s): 1	
if you consider look at the coa8010b c0 in hex is equal to 192 in decimal a8 168 01 1 and 0b 11
in short this is a binary representation not a string representation of 192.168.1.11



14043684
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
when you will add some tag inside another tag like div p with all tag having float left style attribute outer tag width will be increase by inner tag width
but they will appear vertically as height is not fixed



14056198
uiviewcontroller uiwindow
Pattern(s): 5	
b create your own uiviewcontroller that emulates uisplitviewcontroller and hide the left part whenever you need to
meddling with uiwindow is not very safe



14059908
sin math.h
Pattern(s): 3	
sin can be quite slow to call once every sample if you are doing this realtime using an interpolated wavetable lookup method is much faster but the resulting sound will not be as spectrally pure
if you are not doing this realtime using the sin function from math.h is not a bad idea



14067742
free malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
the rest of the statement just says why it s invalid it s not from the stack it s not something you ve got from malloc and not been free recently
the recently is mentioned because valgrind keeps track of free memory for a limited number of frees so it can t say for sure that it wasn t free a million frees back - in this case it wasn t but if you see a message like that it may be that it has become invalid because it was free ages ago



14154978
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
3 the following for-loop is missing some thing
the result elements from element 0 to element length are containing garbage because the result arrays is not initiated



14160809
cypher gremlin
Pattern(s): 1	
in my projects i typically use gremlin and then call cypher from within gremlin or not when i need tabular results or expressive pattern matching- both are a pain in the gremlin dsl
the neo4j team s efforts on cypher have been really impressive and it s come a long way



14164507
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
allocate the block using malloc not new and then use realloc
realloc knows how much free space is available after the block for expansion



14168544
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
so the for-loop will never end continuing on to i 5+ which throws an error because your arrays is not that big
in your for-loop your ending condition depends on a changing but you don t change it



14170593
post put
Pattern(s): 1	
check this thread for more information consequences of post not being idempotent restful api
i think this quote is not really about uuids but about using put which is idempotent instead of post



14204661
ivar subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
effectively that means that your delegate ivar isn t being used at all
in any case if you re writing for ios as opposed to 32-bit mac like you are you don t need the explicit instance variable declaration in your subclassing s interface section because the compiler will automatically create it for you



14214764
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 2	
udp does not
if you have an error that causes tcp to fail which is very rare you have to start over



14244931
mockito jmockit
Pattern(s): 1	
that mockito cannot bypass means mockito isn t currently able to overcome final classes or final methods in order to mock them because at moment mockito uses cglib to generate subclasses of the type to mock
but other frameworks like powermock or jmockit may be able to do it as they have other strategies to overcome this



14247594
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
put the following plugin declaration in your maven pom.xml build file
running wsgen then wsimport then wsgen then wsimport will achieve what you need but you maven will not let you build a module twice



14251298
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
if the superclass does not have a no-argument constructor you will get a compile-time error
super t in the subclassing is explicitly invoking a no-args constructor in its superclass class b



14264803
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 2	
or you can check the man page for sudo and sudoers -- it s possible to configure accounts not to require a passwd and to limit them to particular commands when they do
this is a sudo question not a java one



14269667
selecteditem selectedindex
Pattern(s): 5	
the symptoms of the bug are that selectionchanged doesn t fire selectedindex selecteditem aren t reliable and that back navigation into a page with panorama resets the panorama selected item
for example the following code sample will never fire the messagebox and selectedindex selecteditem won t indicate the correct expected values



14275089
qscrollarea qwidget
Pattern(s): 1	
you should create widget fill it with proper layout and then use qscrollarea setwidget qwidget to make it scrollable
qscrollarea is not a container



14290569
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 1	
notice the routine is strncpy not strcpy
strcpy is unsafe



14329045
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the reason that your first program seems to work and your second doesn t is that for your particular hardware the size of a float is the same as int while an int doesn t have enough room for all the bits in a double
but you re already violating the strict aliasing rules so if you really want to print the bits of a floating point type the right way to do it is to cast to and then iterate over each bit of the chars while incrementing the pointer over each byte of the underlying floating point type



14344171
background-image background-color
Pattern(s): 5	
a gradient is a background-image and not a background-color
so a transition of the background-color would have no effect on the gradient



14386502
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 3	
if you are only defining one accessor you cannot use automatic properties
note that you can define a private set accessor on an automatic properties if you want the properties to be read-only from code outside of the class but read-write from inside the class.



14389869
free calloc
Pattern(s): 3	
no need to initialise to null before malloc but any variable pointers that you later free should be set to null and only free if not null
also initialise pointer values in your structs to null easier to use calloc and get this automatically so your guards work properly



14391320
inline constexpr
Pattern(s): 3	
yes dcl.constexpr 7.1.5 2 in the c++11 standard constexpr functions and constexpr constructors are implicitly inline 7.1.2 .
note however that the inline specifier really has very little if any effect upon whether a compiler is likely to expand a function inline or not



14398264
union distinct
Pattern(s): 5	
depending on the query ef will generate either union all with distinct or just union so your explicit distinct is not necessary
the linq equivalent of union all is concat



14429715
abstract-class superclass
Pattern(s): 3	
this is indicated in a note below the section that the above link points to if this were a situation where the superclass was not an abstract-class then yes abstract true should not be used
although the use of abstract true is not meant to indicate that the bean specification is for an abstract-class it is still required for an abstract-class bean definition so that pre-instantiation is not attempted on that class which would fail for an abstract-class



14435909
runtimeexception unchecked-exception
Pattern(s): 5	
runtimeexception are a subset of unchecked-exception for exceptions from which recovery is possible
unchecked-exception are not checked at compile-time which means that the compiler doesn t require methods to catch or to specify with a throws them



14446438
processors hyperthreading
Pattern(s): 3	
logical processors share nearly all other resources on the physical processors such as caches execution units branch predictors control logic and buses
if the threads execution are each keeping one or more of those shared resources such as the execution unit or buses 100 busy then the hyperthreading will not improve throughput



14480072
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the last for-loop does not affect the complexity of the program since it is already
the for loops are directly dependent on the length of the arrays a



14490306
xlsread textscan
Pattern(s): 3	
although this question is close to being an exact duplicate the solution suggested in the link provided by nathang ie using xlsread is only one possible way to solve your problem
the author in the link also suggests using textscan but doesn t provide any information about how to do it so i thought i d add an example here



14510127
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
since the constructor is a method that is invoked on the construction of the object in the memory heap then once you create a subclassing that inherited from a superclass the constructor of the superclass is not invoked by default
for instance if you have a class vehicle and a subclassing car assume the vehicle constructor is as follows



14515446
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
in godaddy web hosting you should mark set application root to the folder sub-folder containing your application
making it a virtual directory is not enough



14515513
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
in godaddy web hosting you should mark set application root to the folder sub-folder containing your application
making it a virtual directory is not enough



14538083
salt md5
Pattern(s): 1	
using the mailaddress as salt is a good idea
but using md5 is not



14540247
qframe qwidget
Pattern(s): 5	
for example qwidget doesn t have a frame but qframe has a frame
the qwidget class cannot have a frame



14540687
uiviewcontroller uinavigationcontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
i ve performed extensive logging and breakpoint setting investigating if didreceivememorywarning unloads the view when a uiviewcontroller is not the visibleviewcontroller
the results a uiviewcontroller s view does not get unloaded tested using arc in a uinavigationcontroller -based project



14543387
viewdidload viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 5	
it is because viewdidload is implemented before segue
using viewdidappear doesn t help here either as it would load the text after secondviewcontroller is presented to the screen



14551278
ienumerator idisposable
Pattern(s): 5	
it s important to note that even though very few implementations if ienumerator require disposal any code which calls getenumerator on unknown implementation of ienumerable must for correctness attempt the cast to idisposable
the fact that unlike ienumerable implements idisposable does not add to the obligations of code that calls



14552933
opera safari
Pattern(s): 5	
or opera safari will not pass those events to the dom at all
so if you bind ctrl_q or alt_f4 and your safari opera window is closed don t be surprised



14569386
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
i have rolled back the project to the initial state without classes map or custom serializable and changed the struct type to class type and it worked
in resume this exception error is related to structs deserialization not with interfaces deserialization



14580490
bindparam bindvalue
Pattern(s): 1	
anyways seems that the problem was that i was trying to execute the same statement several times or perhaps that bindparam doesn t work in a foreach loop when provided with a value myvalue i would ve used value mykey instead since this functions receives a reference and not a value
anyway i ve decided that for my needs in this case bindvalue is sufficient



14587506
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
but the client-side code isn t the problem here anymore
one of the examples you had shown could work well with any server-side technology including asp.net



14610734
hill-climbing branch-and-bound
Pattern(s): 1	
in short hill-climbing isn t guaranteed to find the right answer but often runs very quickly and gives good approximations
branch-and-bound always finds the right answer but might take a while to do so



14627362
awt swing
Pattern(s): 1	
awt does not work faster
swing componets are light weight



14627764
qobject qvector
Pattern(s): 5	
what you can do is encapsulate a qvector object as a private member in your own class that is derived from qobject and code the modification methods you need and also code and emit signals you need in that class
qvector is not derived from qobject so no signals are emitted



14643407
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
in your example above the superclass constructor calls an overridden method test
this works but is potentially dangerous since the subclassing constructor has not been called and your subclassing will not have been fully initialised



14659261
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 5	
if apache is not a requirement then you can use another server for example nginx
there is a tutorial for getting nginx running on an ec2 environment



14688949
highcharts highstock
Pattern(s): 5	
highcharts are not so fast to display 100k points
for that purpose i advice to use highstock see example with 54k points where charts are build within 0.2 sec



14692366
flying-saucer itext
Pattern(s): 5	
itext isn t the best html parser but you can use flying-saucer for this
flying-saucer is build on top of itext but has a capable xml x html parser



14714167
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
that being said if you work with double values instead of int you ll likely see the results you are expecting
the pow function works with float and double not integers



14723945
clang llvm
Pattern(s): 1	
edit apparently i m mistaken and clang does use some other integer types as well see jens s comment below
yes llvm does not make a distinction between signed and unsigned integer type so both will be lowered to i32



14745894
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
so the promotion to int is necessary to represent values greater than
because unsigned chars cannot be represented by chars



14745894
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
for example if they re both 8 bits and your unsigned chars contains the value 255 that overflows the signed chars - and signed int overflow invokes undefined behavior
anyway printable chars are generally expected to be stored in chars and not unsigned chars and c strings are of type and not etc.



14792021
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
all larger int can not be represented exactly by a float therefore the calculation with numbers having 8 or more digits using float cannot be exact
double precision floating point numbers can represent numbers up to 2 53 9007199254740992 exactly



14805339
memset malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
you can use calloc to automatically clear the memory or memset to clear it manually
malloc doesn t clear the memory so you get garbage in your allocated blocks



14817393
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
so on an 8 bit chars system if the sizeof int is 4 the maximum int is not necessarily 2 31-1 because the specification allows some of those bits to be used as padding. thus the only way to know for sure is to use limits.h
float double are also implementation defined although double is always bigger than a float



14819397
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
when you right-click on a link the parent show up but the children do not because they re not set to show up on links
when you right-click on something besides a link the parent don t show up so the children aren t shown either



14842056
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 1	
so running the gcc command automatically includes the c standard libraries running g++ automatically includes the c++ standard libraries etc
but notice running gcc does not automatically link in the c++ standard library



14853818
opera safari
Pattern(s): 5	
so i end up forgetting selenium test for safari and just go with others google-chrome firefox ie and opera has limited support too you cannot maximize it for now
i seems as though selenium support for safari is not yet implemented successfully and is still experimental



14858110
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome not supported google-chrome does not give access to clipboard
firefox there are steps here to enable clipboard access



14870798
opera safari
Pattern(s): 5	
or opera safari will not pass those events to the dom at all
so if you bind ctrl-q or alt-f4 and your safari opera window is closed don t be surprised.



14885437
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
the pom.xml is in memory as a java object tree of the project setup at build time only when maven reads the pom.xml and creates the model
at runtime maven is not running so pom.version has no value



14903173
ffmpeg libvpx
Pattern(s): 5	
then continue with the guide as shown beginning with the ffmpeg . configure line
this indicates that libvpx did not install properly or you have an old version of libvpx that is version 0.9.1



14904463
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 3	
however for kvo to work the accessor methods have to actually be called
if you change an ivar directly observers of that ivar s corresponding properties will not be notified



14920022
textview imageview
Pattern(s): 5	
you can t do that if the textview_selector.xml set for textview not for your imageview
set that selector to your imageview and call yourimageview.performclick in your textview onclicklistener



14936670
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
you can lookup in the database as the hash will be unique
md5 is not ok for hashing numbers anyone can reverse a numerical md5



14946812
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 1	
strcpy will not work if _friendly_name don t have a 0 before position 16
strncpy will be fine



14952823
mongodb bson
Pattern(s): 3	
also mongodb does not require json php what-ever that is handling knowledge
all results from mongodb come into the driver as bson and are then de-serialzed to a standard dict within php namely an associative array



14955658
ant maven
Pattern(s): 5	
edit an important aspect of the ant-maven comparison is that maven has a convention describing where the files should lie where the dependencies are found where to put the resulting artifact while ant does not
so you can think of using maven like riding a bus - you select the stop where you enter and the one where you leave



14959402
profiling instrumentation
Pattern(s): 3	
this is useful for code profiling but not so much for memory profiling
build mono.cecil for the cf and use it to instrumentation emit right on the target device



14988599
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
also the logic of your for-loop seems to rather count the spaces stored in word
this loops is not useful for you at all just get rid of it



15009507
imapclient thunderbird
Pattern(s): 5	
imapclient is an imap client so it can handle imap thunderbird is also an email including imap client so it s redudant you don t need this to use that
unfortunately imapclient doesn t seem to have an attachment handling method atleast what i could tell from the docs



15014585
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 3	
this is valid directive whether you use apache or not
you don t have to use it but you better do because nginx is very good at serving static files



15021662
mp3 wav
Pattern(s): 5	
yes you have saved a wav file not an mp3 file
either convert to mp3 using something like lame.exe or just use the wavefilereader instead of the mp3filereader



15040985
polymorphism specialization
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to write code that is agnostic about the type of container it is passed then in c++ you write a template instead of relying on abstract interfaces use static polymorphism not dynamic polymorphism
that avoids the overhead of dynamic dispatch and also allows specialization based on concrete type because the concrete type is known at compile time



15050488
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
when you run the application inside visual studio the current directory points to your project s root folder not the application s executalbe path
also some operations can change the current directory opening a file using openfiledialog



15057671
ienumerable ienumerator
Pattern(s): 5	
it remembers the cursor position and ienumerable does not
while iterating through the loop ienumerator maintains the state



15070416
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
i m assuming you are using innodb so this answer is only valid for that engine or any other transaction-capable engine meaning myisam isn t included
by default innodb runs in auto-commit mode



15108783
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 5	
if the call is inline there is no difference between the two approaches - as long as the parameter is known at compile time which it must be a decent compiler will remove the unnecessary switch in both cases
the only case where you would see a difference is if inlining does not occur - in this case the templated approach would allow the switch to be removed while the other would not



15118038
vim jedit
Pattern(s): 3	
vim performs very well with very large files
jedit doesn t support very large files very well



15147366
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
with a normal installation of python and pywin32 using the executables from the linked sites c python27 lib site-packages contained a folder named pywin32_system32 which contained the executables that needed to be copied to c python27 to solve the problem
with the active python installation this directory did not exist



15180084
scheme rebol
Pattern(s): 1	
and this is in addition to the r2 command port scheme being built-in native code which also wouldn t be portable to r3 even if it were open sourced because r3 s system model is different too
and regardless of its portability r2 contains a lot of commercially licensed code that rebol technologies doesn t have the right to open source - pretty much everything that it could open made it into r3 already



15184612
couchbase couchdb
Pattern(s): 3	
meanwhile couchdb is an actively maintained open-source project couchbase server is a completely separate project it is a newer project but it is not a newer version of couchdb - they are not even compatible and since even new tools for creating couchapps still keep being developed eg
see the kanso project then couchdb is not going anywhere soon



15194875
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
in fact you should be using a proven well-known implementation of a strong hash and not implementing the algorithm yourself
the salt is the part that needs to be protected



15202068
slony bucardo
Pattern(s): 5	
one major advantage of slony however is the fact that it has tools for managing ddl changes
londiste and bucardo do not to my knowledge



15225191
fgets strlen
Pattern(s): 5	
you should use fgets not gets in order to prevent your stack to be corrupted by data overruns
second you must manually terminate the string stored in the cpy array since strlen simply counts the number of characters until the very first zero



15271067
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	
in short if md5 isn t good enough for collisions use a stronger hash if the stronger hash are too slow then use a fast hash with low chance of collisions such a as md5 and then use a slower hash such as sha-1 or sha256 to reduce the chance of a collision but if sha256 is fast enough and the doubled space isn t a problem then you probably should be using sha256
hash functions are generally written to evenly distribute the data across all result buckets



15275739
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 5	
many people when coming from vb6 to vb.net miss control arrays
but in reality it s the other way round vb.net doesn t have control arrays because it doesn t need them any more controls can be put into normal arrays and collections in vb6 control arrays were a hack to work around the fact that you couldn t create normal arrays of controls



15279243
getattr setattr
Pattern(s): 5	
you want getattr not setattr
where setattr is a way to set an attribute if you know it s name getattr is a way to get an attribute if you know it s name



15305030
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 1	
use strcpy or add a null terminator after using strncpy
strncpy does not add the null terminator 0 where as strcpy does



15312389
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
address should be an unsigned chars not an int
as an int it reads the memory as if it were an integer you want it to be read as a chars which is only one byte



15327337
sqldatasource objectdatasource
Pattern(s): 3	
i d say sqldatasource is not very appropiated for n-layered applications except n 1 since it talks directly to sql server
on the other hand objectdatasource is a perfectly acceptable option since allows you to call methods from classes on any of the layers the web layer has access to



15336648
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
you can use udp tcp or sctp session well udp is not much of a session layer on top of it
tcp is the general choice



15337282
ssl https
Pattern(s): 1	
server authentication for free https ssl doesn t only solve encryption but also server authentication so that the client can verify whether it s actually talking to the right service
guaranteed to work on the internet http https traffic is common on the internet so you won t run into routing problems or firewalls which are hard to traverse



15344666
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
you can t really concat an int and place it inside a single chars for starters the int itself is larger byte-wise than your entire chars so obviously it can t fit in there
maybe you re really trying to make every element in your array a string multiple chars and not a single chars



15349114
textblock itemscontrol
Pattern(s): 5	
my idea would have been to use an itemscontrol and set the itempanel to wrappanel then insert textblock or contentpresenters for each item
turns out those textblock will not wrap as nicely as i d have expected



15379023
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome does not offer nightly builds although they do have an open source project called chromium that does offer nightly builds google-chrome is based on chromium but they are not identical
similarly safari does not offer nightly builds either though again they have an open source project based on webkit



15381262
onclicklistener onitemclicklistener
Pattern(s): 1	
but the better choice would be to set items non focusable and use onitemclicklistener or make them focusable and use an onclicklistener on the views
also the onclicklistener should not be set for the listview



15385339
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
i guess ie or google-chrome starts redirect processing right after
it knows it s a 307 redirect while firefox does not do so until it



15427976
min max
Pattern(s): 2	
finally it uses min to get the oldest of that set which is e
the max isn t really required in your example but covers the chance that you could have merged the main branch into yours at some point



15441462
cstring bstr
Pattern(s): 5	
if the bstr doesn t have nul s embedded inside you can simply pass it to a cstring constructor that will make a deep-copy of it and you can locally work with your cstring
modifications to that cstring won t be visible on the original bstr



15451655
primefaces icefaces
Pattern(s): 3	
in fact using primefaces requires only adding the jar to your classpath
richfaces and icefaces do not go together



15473272
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
you have been using geocoding versioning v2 now google upgrade its versioning to v3
using this versioning you cannot get ourput directly as csv



15494741
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
you are correct that a parent should not rely on their children thats why you define it in the parent aswell
now the code will always work regardless if the children define the getprice method



15514488
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
invoking the getter does not cause something to become defined
invoking the setter does cause something to become defined



15532326
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
the second node module will help us to read a folder and write a file
concerning the basic fs node.js module i don t know if it is possible to read a directory i m not talking about getting all the files in an array using fs.readdir but handling all the files and their organization in folders



15532326
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
concerning the basic fs node.js module i don t know if it is possible to read a directory i m not talking about getting all the files in an array using fs.readdir but handling all the files and their organization in folder
then when i convert the folder to .tar file i can compress it using gzip of zlib



15535141
rubygems rvm
Pattern(s): 5	
although you ll get ruby2 the installation of rubygems did not complete successfully - notice the warning error running env gem_path ...
instead we ll get rvm install a copy of openssl for us see



15558403
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while myisam implements table-level lock
innodb has transactions while myisam does not



15558403
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has transactions while myisam does not
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not



15558403
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does not
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes



15558403
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not



15564394
addeventlistener onload
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are not using jquery you could use addeventlistener as demonstrated by karaxuna plus attachevent for ie 9
note that onload is not equivalent to - the former waits for css images.



15568342
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
would like to point out that the reason the 3rd snippet you provided works inside the for-loop but not outside is because you are using eval
eval takes a string and executes it as js which is why it is working inside loops but using eval isn t parsing it for future use which is causing it to be unusable elsewhere



15578836
profiling benchmarking
Pattern(s): 5	
the ci profiling doesn t actually does the measuring its the benchmark-libary that does
it measures each benchmarking by getting a timestamp by using microtime when a mark is added



15587786
gam mgcv
Pattern(s): 5	
mgcv gam doesn t find the knots - it places them for you and you can control where it places them via the knots argument
in mgcv gam there is a way to do this your q2 via the predict.gam method and



15596211
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
only public methods that are defined in superclass are accessible
methods defined in subclassing are not



15601618
jscrollpane jviewport
Pattern(s): 5	
in addition to the great advice given by rob camick you re also removing all components directly from and trying to add components directly to the jscrollpane ignoring that the jviewport should not be messed with and that visualized components need to be added to the jscrollpane s viewport not to the jscrollpane itself
so you could add the component to the jscrollpane s viewport by passing it into the jscrollpane s constructor or you could instead call the jscrollpane s setviewportview ... method if you want to swap views that it holds



15603501
post get
Pattern(s): 5	
to get only the page s own post and not the fans who like the page use the post endpoint
you execute an http get to page_id feed



15618612
cvs rcs
Pattern(s): 1	
as i mentioned if you try to do this with a binary file it can corrupt the file which is why if you tell cvs that a file is binary it won t do keyword substitution
the ident command is part of rcs not cvs so you ll have to install rcs on your system if it s not already there



15652914
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
however you say that removing the deployment and then re-deploying actually works so i m not sure how the re-weaving gets done if you don t execute a maven build before redeployment
i m not familiar with aspectj but myeclipse does not execute maven goals to build and deploy projects though you can add builders which may invoke maven externally - note that the maven project builder doesn t execute maven goals so processing specified in your pom.xml will not be executed automatically though obviously you can run maven goals from the run as menu item



15657546
pdfsharp migradoc
Pattern(s): 5	
postscript font have to be converted to truetype for use with pdfsharp migradoc foundation see link above
pdfsharp cannot work with postscript fonts



15658713
openni kinect
Pattern(s): 1	
i should add that openni 2 renders openni unusable to anything else other than windows
openni 1.x with kinect was not oficially supported in other platforms until a guy named avin2 created the sensorkinect project which sits on top of openni and exposes the interface of the kinect to openni



15658713
openni kinect
Pattern(s): 1	
openni 1.x with kinect was not oficially supported in other platforms until a guy named avin2 created the sensorkinect project which sits on top of openni and exposes the interface of the kinect to openni
openni 2.0 is a major refactoring and does not oficially support anything else other than windows for the kinect



15680657
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
in another word unless the profile is activate by default maven doesn t know about it you might be tempted to activate everything by default in your case but bear in mind only one profile can be activate by default at the time
your problem is svnbranch from trunk is only present in your child pom.xml and has no value therefore maven only acts on the gav and not the classifier



15697317
sikuli selenium
Pattern(s): 5	
not sure if this is what you are looking for but if you want to click on something specific that selenium is not able to handle - like browser pop-ups or other pop-ups you can use sikuli script
sikuli does an image comparison and clicks on the same - this is very powerful



15698397
gruntjs package.json
Pattern(s): 5	
it s likely that gruntjs is not installed locally in your project folder which is different than grunt-cli
you have it in your package.json so try doing npm install or alternately npm install gruntjs



15714230
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
you need to define c as an int so that you can identify the eof otherwise it will overlap with some valid chars s value and as you discovered may not be detectable at all if chars is unsigned
your issue is that fgetc returns an int not chars



15727563
crypt salt
Pattern(s): 5	
the actual salt is 128 bit but the encoded salt in the crypt format is 22 character 8 bit character 3 4 132 bit
so 4 bits of the encoded salt are not actually used



15743387
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
an int and a chars are different sizes
passing an array of ints to a function expecting an array of chars will cause that function to treat each int as not necessarily but usually 4 chars



15777113
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
when casting fields as int signed in mysql it will cast all the numeric chars up to the first non-numeric chars -- thus making the reverse work
if the last chars is not numeric it results in 0



15790529
jsdom cheerio
Pattern(s): 5	
jsdom is a module which will provide such content but is not as lightweight
cheerio does not execute these scripts and as a result content may not be visible as you re experiencing



15809547
nsurlconnection nsoperationqueue
Pattern(s): 5	
all the examples i have seen use the main thread to start nsurlconnection which has a runloop
the examples using nsoperation are set up so the operation is concurrent which tells nsoperationqueue not to provide it s own thread they then make sure that nsurlconnection is started on the main thread for example via a call to performselectoronmainthread



15851116
pubnub pusher
Pattern(s): 1	
with pubnub using a long unique channel name as described in this faq
pusher doesn t allow you to have multiple users subscribed to the same channel but to send a message event to only one of those users



15893669
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
but whats happening is for-loop executes in a single clock cycle and i get the output
for loops do not imply anything sequential in verilog



15906337
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
a chars is just an unsigned 16-bit int which is a utf-16 code unit
usually that s equivalent to a unicode chars but not always - sometimes multiple code units are required for a single full chars



15967940
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	
your cpu doesn t support the rdtscp instruction
it s a core i7 instruction and your processors is an earlier generation merom-l



15972754
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 5	
it also allows you to run a cron job immediately in your browser great for debugging cron jobs or schedule the job for immediate execution
if your cron job doesn t appear in aoe scheduler s list view there s an issue with the configuration of the cron job



15984559
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
thus when you login with google-chrome wp sends a login cookie to google-chrome starting a new session
when you then access the site with firefox firefox doesn t have a login cookie so wp prompts you to login and then sends a login cookie to firefox also starting a new session



15987707
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
modifying by hand your index variable inside the for-loop doesn t work the way you think
each time loops body is executed again matlab will overwrite your index with whatever is the next value in the list 0 7 you gave



15988729
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
maven expects a strict single-rooted hierarchy that is only suitable for the simplest projects
provided-scope dependencies are indeed inherited from parent pom.xml but not from pom.xml defined as dependencies and i consider that a maven weakness



15988729
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
provided-scope dependencies are indeed inherited from parent pom.xml but not from pom.xml defined as dependencies and i consider that a maven weakness
given that maven has also difficulties in adding modules as dependencies across module hierarchies i can t say maven is a sophisticated tool to manage multi-module projects



16008246
waitpid posix
Pattern(s): 5	
the wait or waitpid function returns the pid of the corpse and the status value is the status belonging to that corpse
you can find out about core dumps on most actual systems usually wcoredump signal but posix doesn t standardize that



16042217
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	
gumbo - no md5 is not broken but the main purpose of hash like md5 now and in the past was for file checking as you know to check if the contents of the file can be trusted not password storage as hash are very quick to decipher since you wouldn t use bcrypt to check the contents of file since you wait for 30 - 45 seconds.
so this means that a hash was specifically meant to be read quickly



16117329
listview flipview
Pattern(s): 5	
if anyone had tried it in c# using flipview and nested gridview listview and had success do mark a answer with code will be interesting to know
my attempt to put a listview under flipview was not successful



16182317
viewdidload viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 5	
this would mean that viewdidload is not called again and the _groups variable is therefore not updated
i would try putting your _groups code in viewdidappear followed by a reloaddata call on the tableview



16192727
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 3	
the semantics of the operator in vb.net are just a bit different from those of c# and the standard object.equals
the semantics are inherited from vb6 and cannot be changed for backward compatibility reasons



16199052
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
by making the derived method private you d be changing the contract made by the superclass preventing any further subclassing from accessing the originally public method
a function passed a parameter typed to be of the superclass would not know in advance whether it s allowed to call the method or not



16202056
codeigniter yii
Pattern(s): 1	
but i am a big codeigniter fan not yii
yii is also cool though



16232926
mongodb bson
Pattern(s): 1	
the actual checking is done inside mongodb and not mongoengine
the object sent to mongodb should be the same but this is where it gets tricky as with bson order is important and in python with dictionaries its not



16260499
rsa aes
Pattern(s): 1	
rsa is an asymmetric encryption method that encrypts a number less than the modulus of the rsa key 255 bytes would indicate that you re using a 256 8 2048 bit rsa key modulus
what you need to do to encrypt values greater than that is to generate a key encrypt the data using a symmetric cipher aes is not a bad choice and encrypt the aes key using your private rsa key preferably along with some other random data



16268270
int double
Pattern(s): 2	
this will work as long as the double is not bigger than what can fit in an int
you are adding an int to a double so the result is a double which cannot be used with the operator



16285442
textview imageview
Pattern(s): 5	
then center your textview using android centerinparent true
imageview is not a view group so you can t do that exactly



16322346
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
your best solution though would probably be to switch from tcp which is ill suited to this task to udp which is probably a better match
udp does not have connection state and it s also unreliable in that no automatic retries are attempted



16351505
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
is so that the second string that is being created by the for-loop will be correctly null terminated
without that line it will just be a char arrays that cannot be treated like a c string



16359199
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql does not comply with the standard here and folds everything to lowercase
for mysql there is no definite answer on how it does this



16399826
nunit mstest
Pattern(s): 2	
you can then use nunit to run the tests outside vs or use tools like resharper to run those tests inside vs
actually mstest doesn t work with simple class library projects



16421960
maven m2e
Pattern(s): 1	
you have to import your project as a maven project not as a normal java project to eclipse
then m2e gets active and will download the libraries



16431843
getter setter
Pattern(s): 3	
generally getter are not doing any alloc or init for you
your setter is a little closer and i assume this was for a property declared as retain



16442886
subclass superclass
Pattern(s): 1	
a no-arg constructor must be accessible to the subclass that is serializable
if superclass is not serializable fields won t be serialized



16461032
nsmutablestring nsstring
Pattern(s): 1	
nsmutablestring nsmutablestring objects provide methods to modify the underlying array of characters they represent while nsstring does not
nsmutablestring exposes methods such as appendstring deletecharactersinrange insertstring replaceoccurenceswithstring etc



16479465
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
id | int | not null | plain | |
some_data | chars varying 20 | | extended | |



16494353
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
the subclassing is then free to change the value of the properties or even provide different properties accessor and code in the superclass that uses the properties will just work
in general the superclass shouldn t have to know anything about its subclassing



16525898
box-sizing border-box
Pattern(s): 5	
the box-sizing is not consistent between the two
use box-sizing border-box to have the padding and border included in the width



16540407
ssl https
Pattern(s): 5	
if https is not printed that is that the libcurl version your are linking to has not been built with ssl support
in such a case you must re-install it with ssl support turned on e.g yum install libcurl-devel should do the trick



16543369
sip sdp
Pattern(s): 5	
from the perspective of someone using a sip stack writing a sip application there s little difference sip over udp implements various reliability mechanisms resend+backoff for starters
the session descriptions may use rtp for the media streams but sdp is not tied to using rtp



16550403
email dkim
Pattern(s): 3	
first is impossible to be sure that an email will not be marked as spam the only way is that the person who receive the email add the sender address in a white list
spf and dkim are only to guarantee that the email comes from that domain or email but not to guarantee that it is not spam



16561209
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 3	
decrementing a signed integer i not incrementing it and accessing until i overflows to a positive value
using unsigned integers is generally better if you do not need to hold negative values



16621242
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
building a dictionary that maps children to their parent would make the lookup faster
you should keep a list of children not a single string



16622799
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 5	
accessor shouldn t have side effects but you can t guarantee they won t
if the properties is defined the superclass then you have a couple of options



16625988
opengl-es glreadpixels
Pattern(s): 5	
take a look at the gpuimagefilter class for how i extract images from an opengl-es frame including a faster method using texture caches instead of glreadpixels
first i should point out that glreadpixels may not behave the way you expect



16659487
bash zsh
Pattern(s): 5	
since bash doesn t have a precmd i m not sure how to do this
i m not sure how to do this in bash but in zsh there s a hook that gets run before every command



16691111
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 5	
wordpress is also using the same method when cron jobs doesn t available or not been configured
you can schedule the jobs using a mysql database or a file as described here



16713756
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if so you may want to loop through all files and folder in the root directory using os.listdir
the root path is not a file or a folder and doesn t have attributes strictly speaking



16720979
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 5	
there are numerous problems with this question starting with the fact that you ve implemented a very slow version of quicksort but asked a question about mergesort
mergesort is not typically implemented as a tail recursive algorithm



16742511
maven-assembly-plugin maven-dependency-plugin
Pattern(s): 1	
the maven-assembly-plugin worked great for me
i spent hours with the maven-dependency-plugin and couldn t make it work



16745577
xslt xquery
Pattern(s): 5	
xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 utilize xpath 2.0 which is what you are recognizing as xquery in the code above
the above code is xslt 2.0 not xquery



16754371
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 3	
i suppose it is about vb6 not vb.net because setstandard s .
must be setstandard s ... in vb.net and is autoamticaly replaced by visual studio



16762505
pthreads fork
Pattern(s): 5	
since you say these are not pthreads but not what they are it s hard to generalize much more.
one way to make this work as described but of course actual code tends to vary from descriptions is to start the semaphore count at 0 fork a child have the child write without looking at the semaphore count fork another child have that child also write without looking at the semaphore count and then have the parent wait on the semaphore p



16778792
jar war
Pattern(s): 5	
tomcat will not find the class if the poi jar isn t in the web-inf lib of your deployment
check your war or exploded deployment to see if it s there



16841699
gradle ivy
Pattern(s): 5	
they will be mapped to ivy configurations when gradle generates an ivy.xml
gradle s configurations are heavily inspired from ivy not ant but they aren t fully equivalent to ivy s configurations and we d have to discuss what you mean by equivalent



16841814
division addition
Pattern(s): 1	
division gets really bad
interestingly the matrix addition is not much difference at all



16847428
bazaar svn
Pattern(s): 1	
bazaar does not have a subrepository feature
correction apparently there s a bzr-externals plugin available at lp bzr-externals though it emulates the svn externals feature not git submodules or mercurial subrepos.



16859014
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
this happens when a web.config file defines a value for which the parent has already defined and children are not allowed to define themselves
for example you could have in your application s web.config an authentication value of mode windows but the parent has already defined the value as forms



16871754
width text-align
Pattern(s): 5	
your width will have no effect as you can not set the width of an a tag without changing it s display properities
this is why text-align does not appear to be working



16873994
jar war
Pattern(s): 5	
if build-project which is of type war defines utility jar as a dependency at provided scope it needs to be bundled with ear
if your utility jar is not correctly being shared across multiple war files you could troubleshoot it by adding utility at compile scope to build-project



16881975
pow sqrt
Pattern(s): 3	
sqrt on the other hand is guaranteed to be correctly rounded by the ieee specification and that s why your code works with sqrt and not with pow
pow is very difficult to implement correctly --- that is so that things like returns x for those x where that s the right answer



16898180
ftp telnet
Pattern(s): 2	
it s probably injecting telnet byte sequences into your ftp stream it often starts with trying to enable telnet s linemode which the ftp server doesn t understand
i m not really sure why people use a telnet client to interact with arbitrary text-based protocols like smtp and ftp



16899305
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
if is in your for-loop ie indented the same amount as data.append row you ll turn data into a numpy arrays before you ve finished appending items to a list
this will cause the error you see because lists have an append method while numpy arrays do not



16902445
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
when all malloc entries in a virtual page are free that virtual page is then released back to the os this also implies that free does not always release memory back to the os since the virtual page may still have other malloc entries in it
if there is not enough space within a given virtual page to support another malloc of a specified size another virtual page is requested from the os



16911586
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 1	
mex is just a tool which calls one underneath and since g++ is the c++ compiler of gcc you should install this one
as far as i know it will still not work because matlab supports only gcc 4.3 not sure about that



16961860
int boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
since this is an int and not a boolean like the checkbox expects you may have to use the grid events such as cellformatting to read the value from the data source and set the checkbox accordingly but i m not sure
or if this is an object you could expose the int value as a boolean using another custom property



17018049
strsplit read.table
Pattern(s): 5	
strsplit is not required here
read.table should work fine



17021594
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
check if a folder exists already using this
dbmetadata has a property bool isdirectory which helps you to check if it is a directory or not



17024479
junit testng
Pattern(s): 5	
testng from a very early stage was suitable for integration automation testing it has a more powerful version of dataprovider than junit even before junit had dataprovider capabilities
it has much better annotation support than junit and unlike junit testng does not require your before after class methods to be static



17126482
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
yes if the cpu is the same the instructions would be the same but things such as executable file format hardware peripherals memory layout and any os rom services will be different so the program probably won t run
the processors itself doesn t directly deal with displaying things



17159415
youtube vimeo
Pattern(s): 5	
afaik youtube does not offer this service - it only allows you to select members to view the video
not only that but you can add a bunch of videos to an album in vimeo and password-protect the album so you only have to change the password for the album



17175490
floating-point fractions
Pattern(s): 3	
the internal representation of a floating-point value is typically binary so initializing it requires converting from decimal to binary and displaying it requires converting from binary to decimal
most decimal fractions do not have an exact binary representation and most binary fractions do not have an exact decimal representation so it is not meaningful in general to ask for all the digits



17175687
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
are below the top-level project folder not collateral to it
that s mainly because the current working directory is the first entry in sys.path by default which makes it very convenient to import modules and packages below that directory



17187147
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to keep to the enhanced for-loop for copying an arrays there is one mayor problem the enhanced for-loop doesn t have a counter
inserting elements into an arrays however requires a counter



17207596
r5rs r6rs
Pattern(s): 5	
in scheme however the r5rs doesn t mention form at all and talks about expressions only
the r6rs even gives a definition that almost sounds like the exact opposite of the above



17221070
subclass superclass
Pattern(s): 5	
its subclass golfhat declares the variable
subclass inherited non-private members of a superclass it doesn t work the other way round



17274203
oncreate onstart
Pattern(s): 3	
when putting the phone to sleep onpause and onstop get called but ondestroy doesn t so that oncreate doesn t get called when turning the phone back on
onrestart onstart and onresume do get called checked on nexus 7 by modifying the activity lifecycle training app to add log messages in all lifecycle methods so try to move as much code in initialisetabhost as you can from oncreate to onstart leaving only the minimum necessary in oncreate or leave it there and add the relevant part of it to onrestart



17294802
visualvm btrace
Pattern(s): 1	
after a lot more investigating the answer is very simple none of the mentioned profilers are capable of what i wanted in this question - not visualvm not yourkit and not jprofiler
so if you want this kind of information your best bet is probably btrace which is free and in combination with jmx capable of measuring pretty much anything



17301399
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
getter should retrieve the value by their name and explicitly make type conversion
setter shouldn t care - qvariant will



17309044
uiviewcontroller uiwindow
Pattern(s): 5	
if you can t find a way for it to work by adding the view to a uiviewcontroller s view hierarchy then you ll need to manually listen for rotation events and programmatically adjust the positioning of your uiview
things you add to the uiwindow will not respect device rotations



17360772
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
output is 10 because your object is in memory serializable doesn t erase transient fields it s just ignore them on serializable
output is 0 and 10 0 because y is transient field it s not saved on bean serializable so upon deserialization it gets default value witch is 0 for int



17360772
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
output is 0 and 10 0 because y is transient field it s not saved on bean serializable so upon deserialization it gets default value witch is 0 for int
10 is because z is static field thats mean it is not wired with instance serializable also doesn t erase it



17380264
clang llvm
Pattern(s): 5	
change the lib target in the xcode to use the new clang llvm add a cflag -fsanitize address
then build if some api such as opengl system video function is reported not supported then you can put it into the app project your clang doesn t support compiling it



17404281
ctime posix
Pattern(s): 5	
according to ctime cannot be faked at least it s not intended to be fakeable
posix says that atime and mtime are user-settable to arbitrary times



17411184
textinput textfield
Pattern(s): 2	
so you need to extend textinput to work around that
the underlying textfield doesn t expose any properties to stop the cursor from blinking that i m aware of



17421510
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
if you re going to use udp instead of tcp you have to do everything tcp does that udp doesn t by yourself if you need it
one of the things tcp does is transmit pacing -- slow start exponential backoff and so on



17430426
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
that s why most browsers can t animate cross-fade them via css only google-chrome has this non-standard feature
some more info on the topic css3 transition of background-image for firefox not working



17441230
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
here is smaller than b and in for-loop you give condition which will never meet because and are already smaller than b
so this loops will not run even for a single time



17493274
ocamllex ocamlyacc
Pattern(s): 2	
i think you need to define very simple tokens in ocamllex like booleans numbers and variable names then use ocamlyacc to define how they go together to make things like iszero diff and if
ocamllex isn t powerful enough to parse the structures defined by your abstract syntax



17510184
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
constricting the access modifier of a superclass method is an invalid override because it s breaking the superclass contract and invalidates the substitution principle a subclassing object is-a superclass object as well
if this was allowed the above client code would break because your subclassing doesn t have that method public



17529470
mutators setter
Pattern(s): 5	
you can use the fact that mutators is a monad
using untainted from the settable type class in control.lens.internal.setter it is possible to combine two setter but the result will also only be a setter and not a getter



17585778
screens tablet
Pattern(s): 1	
in android we use resolution in dp to measure the screens size not resolution in px
both of your two tablet have the same resolution in px but their resolution in dp are quite different



17600867
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
adding to that int do not give you the decimal part of numbers so a number like 3.5 will get cut down to 3 using int
to fix this double is the way to go



17604200
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 3	
edit just a typedef to some kind of integer wouldn t help you much because these are only aliases for types
all your types aliased to unsigned could be used interchangeably



17607465
filesystems fat
Pattern(s): 3	
but a proper filesystems must be used and fat is not the only filesystems jffs2 yafs ...some other proprietary filesystems
the filesystems is generally but not always implemented on flash memories nand flash nor flash



17639702
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
we could therefore iterate over every point if the coordinate system is based on int and not double and check this condition
if we are faced with double then a modified technique could be used to generate a contains method that will function correctly with high probability



17764624
srt subtitle
Pattern(s): 3	
means that your ssa or srt file doesn t specify the playresx and y values
so the vfilter assume a display resolution of 384x288 thats why your subtitle looks so small on a 1280x576 video



17779356
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
in other words int is a number double is a number but int is not a double
you are trying to cast an instance of int to a reference double which cannot happen



17826484
persistent transient
Pattern(s): 5	
second a pojo can be either persistent your hibernate session is aware of the object and will save changes to the database when your transaction gets fflush or closed or transient hibernate doesn t know anything about this object and won t save changes to the database
calling save makes a transient object persistent and has no effect on a pojo that s already persistent



17834786
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
in firefox i m using v20 the dropdown position its top left at the bottom left of your while google-chrome set its top right at the top right of the select positioning itself above the
plus firefox use the inherited width the one firefox calculated not the one you set of the to set the dropdown s width thus it s overflowing outside of the window



17839439
scheme rebol
Pattern(s): 1	
the rebol http scheme really isn t designed with this in mind it s geared toward reading content the way you would in a browser not services over http
in saying that you can hack the protocol to subvert how rebol 2 handles different response codes



17886312
mouseleave mouseenter
Pattern(s): 3	
when the hoverdiv is inside the other div mouseleave will not be triggered when you hover the hoverdiv
this is happening because when the hoverdiv is shown your mouse is on it thus the mouseleave event is triggered so the hoverdiv disappears and then your mouse is on the first div again so the mouseenter event is triggered so hoverdiv appears again..



17891208
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 5	
uilabel does not have any inherent padding applied
uitextview has padding that nsstring s drawing methods do not have



17898722
memset calloc
Pattern(s): 2	
or you can also use memset explicitly to initialize memory allocated by malloc call
note calloc isn t magic either - it will also use a loop somewhere to replace the garbage with all zeroes



17931535
datalist repeater
Pattern(s): 1	
you can either use a datalist which does have such property repeatdirection or use css to make sure that elements render horizontally first until they fill the available width and then continue to the next row
out of the box the repeater does not allow you to set the repeatdirection



17938448
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 5	
within struct declare the account after typedef
typedef doesn t declare



17952209
pull push
Pattern(s): 5	
usually a client knows that an rss feed has been updated through polling that is regular pull http get request on the feed url
push doesn t exist on the web at least not with http until html5 websocket is fixed



17961429
subclass abstract-class
Pattern(s): 5	
make sure your concrete subclass is marked as component stereotype and being component scanning by spring
component on the abstract-class is not needed as it cannot be instantiated



17963477
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
however here the target directory is not the site-packages folder but the
prefix folder that is the root of the venv



18004842
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
our business logic allowed for it because the checkboxes were basically operating as a chain from a single parent down through its children but not across parent
meaning it didn t matter if not all the parent were fully loaded when the user tried to do work or submit their changes



18028219
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 1	
therefore you have to either implement both accessor and create your own lock or let the compiler do both and use its lock
if the properties is not atomic however you can explicitly implement any combination of the three elements ivar setter or getter and the compiler will take care of the rest



18043466
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
another thing to note md5 is not a good hash function for passwords because it is much too fast
a really fast hash function is a hash function where trying a large amount of passwords from a generator is a trivial task



18048954
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
you can exploit the conversion of cin to bool to decide whether you have detected an int or not
basically where intvalue is an int is an expression which returns true if the next few chars constitute a valid number that can fit into an int and false otherwise



18062996
bower npm
Pattern(s): 1	
any scripts that you include beforehand say a non-browserified jquery will just become a global and bower does not prevent you from accessing globals
beware though some packages distributed via npm based on client-side libraries do not conform entirely to commonjs spec



18071192
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
while loops aren t normally used to iterate over arrays as for-loop syntax is less verbose and allows the sentinel variable i to fall out of scope while the for-loop syntax does not
your for-loop is equivalent to



18104836
addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
in general matrix addition is well-defined mathematical operation so your point about not respecting math requirements is simply wrong
matrix multiplication is not commutative so you shouldn t expect that either



18124388
highcharts highstock
Pattern(s): 5	
highcharts doesn t support ordinal axis
this feature is part of highstock and require highstock lbrary to be used



18126742
coalesce nvl
Pattern(s): 5	
nvl only takes 2 parameters whereas coalesce can take n parameters
when functions or equations are pass into them as parameters nvl will evaluate all of its parameters but coalesce will evaluate each in order stopping when it reaches a non-null value in other words coalesce will use short-circuit evaluation but nvl will not



18133034
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want a true relative link that uses the current folder as beginning point
in case the files in your root directory are not used you can use a htaccess file to forward everything to mysitefolder



18139586
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb supports row-level locking transactions and foreign key constraints
myisam doesn t



18144689
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
if the hash is not salt it is very easy to get the cleartext password using rainbow tables if you got the hash
if the hash is salt it is very easy to get the cleartext password for simple passwords



18148277
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 2	
first most systems have configured sudo in a way to take the current user s passwd not the target user s one
to configure sudo to read the target user s passwd instead you must set



18154912
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
md5 hash is not the best choice if security really matters
however if you will use any hash function consider binary type for it instead md5 will produce 16-byte hash so binary 16 would be enough instead of char 32 for 32 characters representing hex digits



18163273
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 5	
you can put arbitrary code in the accessor methods throwing an exception when you are not happy with the value passed to the setter for example very common
the underlying storage for the properties doesn t have to be a field either you can expose the field or properties of another class object for example



18165141
division subtraction
Pattern(s): 1	
division requires iterative subtraction that cannot be performed simultaneously so it takes longer
in fact some fp units speed up division by performing a reciprocal approximation and multiplying by that



18183724
int boolean
Pattern(s): 1	
update answer for your comment in case you have non-boolean value or default value zero for int do not fit your requirements with defaultifempty you can provide own default value if there is no items matching your condition
default value for boolean is false so you even don t need any conditions - just select first or default isdefaultlimit value



18205099
mergesort heapsort
Pattern(s): 5	
mergesort has the disadvantage that its memory complexity is o n whereas heapsort is o 1
on the other hand mergesort is a stable sort and heapsort is not



18218032
ffmpeg libav
Pattern(s): 5	
ffmpeg does not yet support hls version 4
as of 2013-07-29 commit c44191039944526dd7eb6e536990b555837961f5 libav ffmpeg have supported version 3 of the protocol



18238760
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 3	
vb.net is actually the name of two rather different languages which are selected based upon the option strict setting
the option strict off dialect which is unfortunately the default was designed to facilitate porting of vb6 code and has horrible goofy semantics which are even worse than those of vb6 i m not sure even its designers know all of the odd corner cases of the way different types interact



18240726
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
i am not an osx user so this platform might work differently than i think but it nowhere looks good when the linker tries to access folder which don t exist
ld warning directory not found for option



18249957
nvda voiceover
Pattern(s): 5	
nvda not supported no support options
voiceover not supported no support options



18261464
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
the cpu doesn t report that
you can find processors information using sudo dmidecode --type processors on linux



18273098
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp does not have any mechanism to ensure data delivery this make it much faster but unreliable without some hand crafted data protection mechanism
tcp you don t have to worry about packet size if you try to send a bigger chunk then possible wil be automatically and transparently split by the operating system for you



18291714
opengl-es glsurfaceview
Pattern(s): 3	
if you want more than one opengl-es context running concurrently that is much more complicated but it has been discussed recently on the khronos.org opengl-es forum
glsurfaceview is not designed to do this but you can do it by using textureviews instead



18324531
backbone.js javascriptmvc
Pattern(s): 1	
backbone.js is the simplest javascriptmvc library not a framework that you can find
it clearly defines what model the data that is synced to rest api view this is kind of confusing as view plus router in backbone.js is equal to controller in mvc world and template this is the view in mvc world



18333667
mri rubinius
Pattern(s): 1	
1 only the case on mri not on jruby and rubinius
jruby and rubinius fully support multi-core threads in a single process



18398991
passenger unicorn
Pattern(s): 1	
passenger is not as stable as most people think
a nginx + unicorn is more stable imho



18404543
webkit gecko
Pattern(s): 3	
the upshot is that in some cases webkit ends up recomputing style on a lot more elements than gecko does as far as i can tell but in others it ends up recomputing style on many fewer elements
for example given a selector like .foo span and a div that changes class from foo to bar gecko will restyle all later siblings of the div while webkit will not do any work at all if there are no span kids since it would never have marked the parent as being affected by the + in that case



18410174
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
a salt derived from any value that has a relation with the value to be hash is not a salt it s just an altered hashing algorithm
salt are entirely pseudo random noise period



18422933
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
as pascal cuoq reminds me in comments if plain chars is unsigned and as wide as int then an expression of type chars will be promoted to unsigned int not to int
this can happen only if if the implementation has 16-bit or bigger bytes and if and if plain chars is unsigned



18423280
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
console.read return an int that represent a chars so using if the user inputs 1 you may have a different value in your length variable
your static double main doesn t return a double



18428024
qtablewidget qlistwidgetitem
Pattern(s): 3	
if you need to display multiple checkboxes in the same row qtablewidget is probably what you are looking for
qlistwidgetitem is not used in that way



18461572
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
firefox seems to mess up fonts the most - on the other hand the text looks bold
chrome and safari doesn t alter fonts nearly as much making them look sharper but not really bold at all



18503991
jslint jshint
Pattern(s): 1	
jslint does not currently have any support for any of the specced or proposed es6 features
jshint does have a basic level of support for some es6 features and is gaining more support fairly regularly



18504642
bash zsh
Pattern(s): 5	
bash doesn t support float values
zsh does support float values



18552570
cout ofstream
Pattern(s): 5	
cout is not of type ofstream so you cannot bind an ofstream reference to it
output_stream should be type instead which will allow it to refer to either cout and a file stream since ofstream is a subclass of ostream



18559744
des aes
Pattern(s): 3	
to start with aes rijndael is definitely recommended in favor of des as the encryption algorithm
des is not considered secure enough any longer



18574990
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
reading input into string and checking for first literal if it is not minus then convert into unsigned integer would be preferable rather than the below method
because half of the part unsigned integers not covered



18596158
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
i tested the nverba fork of that code which updates the code to reflect the improvements in the visualization api and it functions in google-chrome but not firefox
since the code used to work in firefox i assume that either an update to firefox or the canvg library broke functionality in firefox there s nothing specific in the visualization api that would cause functionality in firefox to break



18597709
memcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 5	
on the other hand memcpy doesn t care about 0 bytes and just copies the whole thing
to put it another way strncpy finds a 0 byte inside the first integer and stops copying



18609264
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
physically the controller resides in the southbridge component which controls all the peripeherals of the motherboard and sends data it reads from the drive to the northbridge component which interfaces to the cpu s graphic controller and ram
this description illustrates a design which applies to many processors but not all amd s opteron being one



18618178
agile sprint
Pattern(s): 5	
agile does not mean that the team has to work more but mean that the way you work should focus on working software over documentation for example
in scrum with the sprint you plan the development for usually 3 to 4 weeks then in the end deliver a working software



18630847
win64 windows
Pattern(s): 3	
components have the win64 flag set appropriately
windows installers cannot be built to target any cpu i typically build twice with the managed code being set to any cpu whilst the installer has two configurations x86 and x64



18658100
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
so with this knowledge of why hash are usefull you get to the next point
if you consider a 16 byte hash such as md5 which really shouldn t be used for cryptographic purposes but you already knew that that gives you 128 bits of entropy



18671780
nsmutablestring nsstring
Pattern(s): 1	
nsmutablestring nsmutablestring objects provide methods to modify the underlying array of characters they represent while nsstring does not
for example nsmutablestring exposes methods such as appendstring deletecharactersinrange insertstring replaceoccurenceswithstring etc



18676962
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 2	
you need to use an indexed for-loop to initialize or rereference the elements of the arrays
the user reference you have here is a copy of the reference in the arrays not the actual reference



18764485
std ostream
Pattern(s): 5	
since std cout is an ostream object its type is derived from std ostream it cannot be copied
std istream and std ostream objects cannot be copied



18794562
strcpy malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
strcpy itself doesn t allocate memory for the destination string
malloc allocates a block of size bytes of memory returning a pointer to the beginning of the block



18800765
strlen calloc
Pattern(s): 5	
however the calloc call has another bug you add 18 to the result of strlen which is the number of payload characters you add in your printf calls
which is one too few because the result of strlen does not include the null byte



18811328
stdout stdio
Pattern(s): 2	
assuming you use stdio to make the c program produce output more fluidly you can add fflush stdout in appropriate places or you can disable buffering with a call to setvbuf
the c program probably detects that its stdout is not connected to an interactive console and buffers its output



18920739
rsa aes
Pattern(s): 1	
you should be encrypting your data with a symmetric key like aes then encrypting the symmetric key with rsa
rsa should not be used to encrypt this kind of data



18926665
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
fwiw dns is based on udp so talking to a public dns server might be a good starting point
apache is an http server http being a protocol built on tcp not udp



18933086
uiviewcontroller uinavigationcontroller
Pattern(s): 1	
the message you are seeing is because at index 0 there is a uiviewcontroller instance corresponding with the label view controller - gestures in your storyboard and you are trying to send it a message that uiviewcontroller does not respond to in the belief that it is a uinavigationcontroller
the uinavigationcontroller that contains the playersviewcontroller controller is at index 1 in the tab bar controller s viewcontrollers array



18944072
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
inherited refers to how members of the superclass are accessible through the subclassing
the subclassing will not actually get copies of its own



18967773
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
this version fails because the list iterator used by the for-loop doesn t know you deleted elements from the list
deleting the value at index 0 shifts up the rest of the list but loops iterator looks at item 1 regardless



19023063
juce cinder
Pattern(s): 3	
from what i gathered about cinder it s being a very basic cross-platform application framework mores a platform for doing really cool graphics stuff but not nearly as general purpose as juce is
juce does not have to be the main for your application



19055487
subtraction multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
when default exception handling is in effect a subtraction that produces a tiny in the subnormal interval 1 non-zero result conceptually causes an underflow exception but there is no observable effect because
a subtraction that produces a tiny result is necessarily exact due to characteristics of the floating-point format there are no significand bits lower than the bits in a subnormal value and subtraction unlike multiplication cannot mathematically have any lower bits than there are in the inputs



19057126
getter setter
Pattern(s): 3	
here i d recommend either putting the logic to calculate the volume on the getter and using only that method or having the getter call volume in case you need the latter in another part of the cylinder class
your setter methods aren t doing the validation because you re not calling them at all



19065618
crypt salt
Pattern(s): 1	
the php crypt function generates a unique hash
if the salt is not specified then a random salt will be generated



19066399
listview gridview
Pattern(s): 1	
the gridview is visible by default and the listview is not
when we navigate to the page the visualstatemanager is called after the page is rendered and therefore when navigated to the gridview is visible for a short time and calls the loadmoreitemsasync method before it gets hidden



19074611
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
a subclassing does not have to have any constructor with the same number of parameters in the constructor as the superclass but it does have to call some of its superclass constructors from its own constructor
if the superclass has a no-arg constructor it is called by default if an explicit call to a superclass constructor is omitted or if the subclassing has no explicit constructor at all as is your case but since your superclass does not have a no-arg constructor compilation fails



19108243
tcl racket
Pattern(s): 1	
most other interpreters ruby perl tcl do not have pyeval equivalent so they will be slower even if their json implementation is written in c
some other lua racket mzscheme have pyeval equivalent but is zero meaning that you will have to add additional step explicitly and recursively converting objects into vim dictionaries and lists which will impact performance



19144073
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 3	
it was never intended to be a safe version of strcpy but is often misused for such purposes
it is in fact considered to be much more dangerous than strcpy since the null termination mechanism of strncpy is not intuitive and therefore often misunderstood



19163398
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
maven has a concept of importing dependencies
the documentation says that this feature is for cases where extending a base pom.xml is not possible



19204335
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 3	
the other is that while datacontractjsonserializer writes the local offset during serializable it doesn t use it properly during deserialization
it just assumes that if any offset is provided that the time should be local - even if the computer doing the deserialization has a completely different offset



19206311
stdout fflush
Pattern(s): 1	
stdout can be line-buffered meaning that output won t appear until you ve printed an entire line
the fflush isn t always necessary but it s a good idea



19218088
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
lacking brackets the for-loop only includes the next indented code line
the attribute d is defined inside the for-loop statement and goes out of focus beyond loops cannot be referenced used in the option pane



19261409
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
the google-chrome launcher also has the same issue but you must have it installed in the appdata folder of your profile which is the first place the google-chrome launcher checks
the firefox launcher doesn t take into account 64 bit windows



19265803
tez hadoop
Pattern(s): 3	
as mentioned tez is still in the incubator stage so use it with a bit of caution
hadoop doesn t support streaming the output of one mr job to another



19350736
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp does not guarantee packets will be received in the same order they are sent or even received at all or that they are recevied exactly once
udp is more of a fire and forget whereas tcp maintains a connection state



19351353
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
int is a type
strings even individual chars are not integers



19367990
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
will generate a setter named setstatuslabel and a getter statuslabel and a _statuslabel
there will be no variable named statuslabel when you use self and . syntax you are really calling the setter getter and not accessing the variable directly



19448254
screens tablet
Pattern(s): 5	
usual practice for android platform is to provide images only for different screens densities not for screens sizes
if i use tablet i don t want to see big images i want see more information



19492850
maven buildr
Pattern(s): 1	
the coolest approach is imo taken by lockjar which builds a frankstein of bundler and maven and provides a nice abstraction to avoid the famous maven uncertainty principle
buildr does not resolve dependencies by design



19509824
junit powermockito
Pattern(s): 5	
perhaps powermockito doesn t support custom junit runners in which case it won t work with spock
looks like powermockito is installing its own junit runner overriding spock s one



19515492
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 5	
cron just runs jobs periodically meaning the job starts and stops and no more often than once minute
cron doesn t handle dependencies



19515590
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
firefox handles this syntax different from google-chrome as can be seen if you type the following in both console windows
this works in google-chrome not in firefox



19526158
rowsorter abstracttablemodel
Pattern(s): 5	
this is because the rowsorter calls tablemodel.getcolumnclass int index to get the class associated to the column in index position and use its comparator to do the sort
defaulttablemodel extends from abstracttablemodel and doesn t override getcolumnclass int columnindex method



19547446
whirlpool md5
Pattern(s): 1	
namely that you can use the smaller and cheap checksum to see if doing the more expensive md5 sha whirlpool is worth considering in the event of changed files
adler-32 and md5 are not comparable in this way



19571007
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if sd card is formatted as fat fat16 you can not put more than 65534 files in a folder but root folder have a limit of 512 files
if it s formatted as fat32 directory does not have file limit



19591104
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 1	
first all radio button should have the same so if you select one the other will be deselected
if the checkbox are not readonly you can code the selection logic in an init function



19595607
subclass abstract-class
Pattern(s): 1	
have the abstract-class use a generic and each subclass defines the generic
an aside your abstract-class doesn t compile



19611406
distance polygons
Pattern(s): 3	
usually if you want to bias the depth against angle think of it like anisotropic bias for shadow maps you would use glpolygonoffset ... when you create the shadow map and in your shader you would use a constant bias or a bias that varies slightly with distance but not angle
the problem with polygons offset however is that it will disable hierarchical z-buffering when enabled so shadow map construction fill-rate will theoretically dip



19631737
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 3	
if gcc g++ are not installed then you need to install them via homebrew
cmake setup in the cmake settings make sure that both the c and c++ cuda host compilers are set to your install of gcc g++ usually in usr local bin



19635905
vlookup countif
Pattern(s): 5	
vlookup works ok on closed workbooks unless you have lookup values with more than 255 characters or if return values go above that same limit
the problem with the formula you quote is not with vlookup but countif - countif doesn t work on closed workbooks - see here



19651305
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
enumeration values are of type int in c and int is commonly four bytes 32 bits on most platforms
so trying to access the values as chars will not give you the expected result



19659057
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
list list int is cast to list seq int and then its map has the proper type for intseqtoint
your problem is that double is not a subclass of number



19697619
aptana rubymine
Pattern(s): 1	
aptana 3 is a useful ide integrated development environment based off of eclipse to use
if you are into paid ide s then webstorm phpstorm rubymine may not be a bad choice especially if you also work with android studio or intellij idea



19732413
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
because unsigned int is not the only unsigned integral type
size_t could be any of unsigned chars unsigned short unsigned int unsigned long or unsigned long long depending on the implementation



19773536
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
assuming that your images folder is the same depth on the tree as your css folder this should work for you
your reference needs to be relative to your css directory not your page location



19809895
division modulo
Pattern(s): 5	
modulo returns the remainder of the division and the division operator returns the quotient of the division
you should use modulo not division operator



19810505
opcache apc
Pattern(s): 5	
with php5.5 the built-in opcache is replacing the apc byte coding caching functionality
however opcache is not a general cache like memcache or apc



19820402
hive hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are not into writing mapreduce jobs you can probably rig something combining hive ctas create table as select and hdfs operations
the underlying file system hdfs does not support updating or even appending files



19832393
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
this is part of the problem as firefox requires it google-chrome does not - this explains why it works there
the next issue with firefox is that overflow hidden set on .home-auto-interactive causes all descendant elements to be flattened according to the spec w3c transform-style



19833997
free realloc
Pattern(s): 5	
first of all i d like to point out you are not addressing the vulnerability as the memory released by free is not being cleared as well same as realloc
also note your code does more than the old realloc it throws an exception when out of memory



19917999
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
the parent process has several children and gets the exit status of them one in a time when they terminate
children do not terminate in any particular order it s up to the operating system and you cannot assume one is going to terminate before another



19922990
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome doesn t provide the response code or body if it s a 400 code error
firefox provides the response code but not body



19924023
namenode hdfs
Pattern(s): 1	
the namenode is a single point of failure for the hdfs cluster
hdfs is not currently a high availability system



19936672
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql also supports nested tables see for example and a number of array-related features
mysql does not support nested tables but there s a set data type to consider



20027231
xctest ocunit
Pattern(s): 5	
the reason xctest is not part of sdk 6.1 but i am still building my project with base sdk ios 6.1 this so answer explains how to integrate sdk 6.1 into xcode 5
since i am unable to continue with the migration my solution for the moment is therefore to keep my unit tests based on sentestingkit ocunit until i find the time to upgrade my app to ios 7



20039500
printf strcmp
Pattern(s): 1	
you must nul-terminated the string otherwise printf will not know for sure when to stop reading from the pointer you just passed
the same applies to other functions like strcmp you could have two strings with the same content while having strcmp yelling non-zero because of a non nul-terminated string



20056622
junit testng
Pattern(s): 1	
junit is creating a new instance of the test class before each test so junit fans like me will never face such problem
testng is not creating a new instance of test class



20057647
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
the getter is not always simply return foo sometimes you will want to initialise other objects or perform logging
similarly the setter provides a neat mechanism for validating the new value attempting to be assigned to the variable



20067763
openmpi mpich
Pattern(s): 5	
the fault tolerance in openmpi is kind of experimental one of the ompi developers namely jeff squyres visits stack overflow from time to time - he could give a more definitive answer and has to be explicitly enabled at library build time with an option like
by default mpich also cannot handle such situations



20160302
xen openvz
Pattern(s): 3	
virtualizing with xen doesn t change that as it is pretending to be just a normal hardware
openvz is working a bit different and as i understand it the name of the ethernet device venet0 got set by the system administrator of the physical machine



20269167
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
in this scenario the resulting location of your file is the iis process startup directory not a folder inside you web site
if you want to reach a file inside your web site folder you use server.mappath



20304476
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
force import the maven pom.xml using the reimport all maven projects button in the maven tool window on the right side by default
if the pom.xml is not yet showing click the add button navigate to the pom.xml file and add it



20322002
hash hmac
Pattern(s): 3	
now and hmac is slightly different than a hash
the hmac is a keyed hash while the hash is not keyed



20348612
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to use sizewithfont it works fine for uilabel but not necessary with uitextview
uitextview is a subclass of uiscrollview and you should use content size after you set up a text to get the size



20372030
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
well int is assignable from object so i can export as with no problem
however if i exported an and instead it will fail because double is not assignable to int



20416824
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
further no one-way hash should be a reversible function
md5 is not a reversible function



20493106
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
thus maximum throughput possible as compared to udp based transmission is already halved
the tcp doesn t support multicasting or the new emerging standard of multicasting amt



20521669
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
turns out i was wrong - user downloaded the file via google-chrome which also sets this flag
firefox doesn t set it i checked on the latest versions to date



20522095
stringbuilder stringwriter
Pattern(s): 5	
usually the choice is between string and stringbuilder not stringwriter
stringwriter is a character output stream and i suppose is not what you need



20528091
uidatepicker uipickerview
Pattern(s): 5	
uidatepicker isn t that customizable
you ll need to set up your own uipickerview containing the time range you re looking for



20531398
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
you will need to use the c++03 for-loop syntax using an iterator or std for_each
c++11 range-based for loops aren t supported in visual studio 2010



20537505
typhoeus vcr
Pattern(s): 1	
excon faraday and typhoeus all have built-in stubbing apis
when you need a response that is not easily recordable vcr is not the right tool



20547404
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
that is an important thing to keep in mind the maven pom.xml is the lead in this kind of project setup
if you want settings to change try to do that through the pom.xml and not through eclipse project settings directly or doing a project update might revert what you have changed



20561973
erlang elixir
Pattern(s): 5	
if you search the erlang questions mailing list you can find plenty of discussion on the topic
note that protocols in elixir are not implemented like that though



20625815
opera firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
opera also doesn t support mp4 and i can t find evidence that they will use the os s decoder if available
regarding firefox mp4 is not usually supported



20645259
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
read your bytes into an int which is always 32 bits in java then use this
you need double not float because single precision floating point won t necessarily be long enough to hold your 32 bit fixed point number



20648208
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	
vimage optimizes image processing by using the cpu s vector processors
if a vector processors is not available vimage uses the next best



20668058
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
one thing that i could do is just catch and log an error only when the superclass cannot be investigated
so the subclassing would be outputted correctly



20691142
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
this versioning contains support for the postgresql json data type so i would recommend upgrading to this versioning and trying again
if you can t upgrade or the upgrade still isn t working for you you can also change your column type to something else like text



20721343
box-shadow box-sizing
Pattern(s): 1	
box-shadow not necessary
box-sizing -moz- required by current future chrome



20738305
width margin
Pattern(s): 1	
since the smaller child view is 50dp you have added a margin of 130dp the total width it needs is 180dp but the parent view itself is only 150dp wide
that is - the child plus the margin cannot fit inside the parent



20760206
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
if you pass a string you get a hash which cannot be reversed. it can be used for comparison purposes
some of the hashing algorithms are md5 not considered secure sha-1 sha-256



20779487
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 2	
and u must use for-loop inorder to iterate each element.
the if loops will not working since arrays length is 4



20796573
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
you write two folder named driverlib and inc on the main folder
a folder name that begins with a is by definition at the root of the directory structure not within any other folder



20808306
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 3	
i know this to be true because i remember when car radios had real radio button and i was reliably yelled at whenever i tried to make the row of button straight so that no button was pressed
you re talking about a checkbox not a radio button



20824172
glfw glew
Pattern(s): 2	
however one possibility you could try is to use glfw to create a compatibility context initialize glew destroy the glfw window and create a new one with the core context
i ve encountered similar issues with glew not properly initializing all the function pointers if you create a core profile



20841523
777 tmp
Pattern(s): 3	
note that chmod 777 is always a bad idea though and only ubuntu people do that
if data local tmp is not mounted noexec which it most likely is you can run it using



20847933
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
instead use biginteger which uses an arbitrary number of bits to represent an exact int limited only by memory
double doesn t have enough bits 52 to exactly hold 65 17



20857878
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
you are passing the value into the super constructor but the field value in the superclass is not a class variable it s a local variable
the field value in the subclassing is global but not getting set by the super constructor due to this



20877223
rfcomm l2cap
Pattern(s): 1	
usually encapsulation is used when you don t want to hassle with something else in this case they didn t want to hassle with the signalling issue rfcomm is used for serial interface so they didn t want to handle the signalling issue of serial interfaces
same thing here rfcomm uses l2cap but doesn t mean you need to know l2cap to use



20953857
loops while-loop
Pattern(s): 3	
if the condition in the while-loop is not met loops never executes
a do-while loops works almost the same way except the condition is evaluated after execution of loops hence loops always executes at least once



20978944
websphere ibm
Pattern(s): 5	
ibm websphere bundled java
ibm jvm doesn t like indexed png files



20980841
uicollectionview uitableview
Pattern(s): 5	
every uicollectionview has a layout object a uicollectionviewlayout subclass that describes where each cell should go in the collection view s scroll view and which cells are visible in a given cgrect
uitableview doesn t have this so it would be much harder to do anything that manipulates the position of its cells



20982365
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
also signed is implied so signed int is the same as int
exception chars is not the same as signed chars it s a distinct type with implementation-defined signedness.



20986504
nsstring nserror
Pattern(s): 1	
if a method such as nsstring fails init things are so bad that recovery really is not possible
probably so bad that allocation an nserror is not possible much less an nslog message



20993362
vmware virtualbox
Pattern(s): 2	
just make sure that when you add the vmdk into vmware don t click upgrade format when prompted keep the current one in case virtualbox doesn t accept it
you can use vmware player to resize a vmdk



21003284
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome is not a supported browser for ssrs report builder
only ie firefox and safari are officially supported



21009320
qnetworkreply qcoreapplication
Pattern(s): 3	
the returned qnetworkreply is just a pointer that you can use later to access members but it does not yet contain the reply that at that point
you are instantiating a qcoreapplication but not actually using it for running an event loop which is necessary for the async operation for getting the reply



21009442
pandas pytables
Pattern(s): 3	
since functionality provided by pandas is not needed and the processing is much slower see notebook below the best approach is using pytables or h5py directly
i ve tried only the pytables approach so far



21021881
range max
Pattern(s): 5	
and be carefull the range is min
max not min



21069809
atan2 sine
Pattern(s): 1	
atan2 computes not only the arctangent for your vector but also takes care of the nasty case-handling whenever your angle would not be definite
remember that cosine sine are periodic with period pi so just using a delta-value will result in two possible angles 1 1 and -1 -1 will both result in the angle 45



21092462
bash subshell
Pattern(s): 5	
the in bash is not a fork
it tells bash to launch the command in a subshell and continue parsing for other commands instead of waiting for that command to finish



21122205
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 5	
solved the issue with strncpy though i ll use strcpy to improve readability
what i think it happened is that response is being allocated on top of the variable where i wrote the request then it wasn t being completely zero-ed and since strncpy doesn t add the final 0 like strcpy does then response would become a mix of old and new data



21135541
cout cin
Pattern(s): 5	
you ll also get std cout for putting information back out when you choose to do so
std cin is not part of the language but is actually provided by libraries



21141068
fossil git
Pattern(s): 1	
and another lesser-visible system using real database fossil doesn t have stellar performance pdf either
git started as a minimal set of tools implementing a versioned file system and its author linus torvalds originally envisioned that a full-blown vcs will be a tool based on git



21170970
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
free is a c standard library function and does not call the destructor of an object
and malloc does not call the constructor.



21171665
uipagecontrol uipageviewcontroller
Pattern(s): 3	
uipagecontrol does not do anything much except display some dots
if you want a way of switching between view controllers it sounds like you want uipageviewcontroller which is a completely different animal



21185303
range max
Pattern(s): 1	
as has been pointed out the question is for range not for detecting single point inclusion
however it s simply an elaboration of that because range min max should return true if and only if both min and max are not included -- you simply have to test both points or alternately if one of the a range in the database endpoints is contained within range min.max



21186611
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 5	
assumed all properties accessor have not null references to beans
that could be achieved via providing corresponding getters and setters to properties and initializing bean references if necessary



21270846
tunnel packets
Pattern(s): 5	
ip tunnel encapsulate an ip packets into another one
at the end a link protocol is needed to carry the resulting packets but not directly to handle the first one



21278911
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
it appears there s a difference in google-chrome s webkit engine vs firefox s gecko engine
firefox continually runs to check a hover status while google-chrome does not



21285671
datamodel relational-model
Pattern(s): 3	
if you have compound keys you can create calculated columns to act as surrogate keys as the powerpivot datamodel does not support keys using multiple columns
at this point relational-model is fully represented in excel and it is possible to create pivot tables or even dashboard style powerview reports that leverage both the data and the relationships



21288636
mvp presenter
Pattern(s): 1	
mvp could not be simpler which is why i start with it
the viewmodel is replacement for the unidirectional presenter it s a state-tracking bidirectional equivalent



21348144
pem pkcs#12
Pattern(s): 5	
in other words a der or pem encoded x509 certificate
what you re providing it via that inputstream is a pfx file a pkcs#12 file not a der or pem encoded certificate



21349390
switching screens
Pattern(s): 5	
you can imagine this pointer switching does not require very much time
i hope you see now that directly writing an image to the screens actually causes much more delay and annoying flickering



21360039
build.gradle gradlew
Pattern(s): 5	
note in gradlew build system minsdkversion and targetsdkversion defined in androidmanifest will be overridden by what you define in your module s build.gradle file
so define them in build.gradle file not in manifest



21373335
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 1	
java serializable was an old mechanism create decade before annotation
i guess that is why default serializable deserialization does not handle problem properly



21411803
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
nested for-loop doesn t necessarily mean it s not o n any more
if what s inside the nested loops gets executed o n times then the nested loops is perfectly fine



21483676
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
checkbox allow multiple selections while radio button do not
users should expect them to work like that and would get confused if checkbox worked like radio button i know i would get confused.



21496996
cvs svn
Pattern(s): 5	
cvs supports rollback commit feature while svn not you need to commit a second time and overwrite your previous commit manual rollback
cvs only tracks modification file by file while svn tracks a whole commit as a new revision which means that it is easier to follow the history of your project



21534148
strncpy strtok
Pattern(s): 3	
by comparison this section of your code is a little scary because i do not know the output of the strncpy which depends so heavily on the third argument and can corrupt place unexpected results into parsecommand
along the lines of keeping the target buffer pure even though it does not appear to be an issue here strtok is not thread safe

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
in a for-loop the over head of the for-loop is not significant
loops is an unrolled loops 1000 loads long



21558413
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
by using a for-loop and using loops variable to reference the arrays you are checking element 0 followed by element 1 etc
in actual code you wouldn t use i 3 in the for-loop just because it means that loops wouldn t scale with the size of the arrays



21560813
qplaintextedit qtextedit
Pattern(s): 5	
as implied in the comments modifying the qtextedit to a qplaintextedit fixed the issue
qtextedit is not designed for handling very large paragraphs which is effectively what i was creating



21588513
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
indeed google-chrome doesn t have it but firefox 27 has it
for those who want to see this issue just hit his url in firefox and scroll down and up



21598834
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
they should be hash not encrypted
md5 is a hashing algorithm but a very weak one that is entirely unsuitable for protecting passwords with today



21608307
updatepanel formview
Pattern(s): 1	
it sounds like your updatepanel is not getting refreshed
since you confirmed that the modechanging and modechanged events occurred i don t there is actually a problem with your formview it seems like a red herring



21625336
typedef typename
Pattern(s): 1	
typedef does not need to appear before the type
this is perfectly valid and in this case i hope you can understand that parsing would be complicated if typename were optional



21633735
unicorn webrick
Pattern(s): 1	
so unicorn is ok but thin and webrick are not mmmm
my guess is that the working directory used by the daemon process for thin and webrick is not rails.root



21636308
qgraphicstextitem qgraphicsscene
Pattern(s): 1	
if your test is re-cast in a more realistic way the qgraphicstextitem remains visible after removal from the group
the qgraphicstextitem can never be parented to a scene because it s parent must be a qgraphicsitem which qgraphicsscene does not inherit



21646234
hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
md5 is not a good hashing algorithm for passwords as it s designed for speed that s the opposite of what you want you want the password generation to be relatively slow so use a more secure algorithm and hash multiple times
you can generate a hash using sha-256



21651351
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
event if you decided to use c temp the folder may not exist and you may not have the required privileges to either create it or write to it
you could use system.getproperties user.home which will return the current users home directory which is more likely to allow you to write to it



21661920
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
current versions of mysql has not good planner as postgresql has there is progress - so complex queries are usually much better on postgresql - and really simple queries are better on mysql
complexity of postgresql configuration is myth



21682496
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
superclass receive this message before their subclassing
the superclass implementation may be called multiple times if subclassing do not implement initialize the runtime will call the inherited implementation or if subclassing explicitly call super initialize



21686575
nsurlconnection nsurlsession
Pattern(s): 5	
nsurlconnection cannot help you there
nsurlsession has a facility for uploading files in the background outside of that time



21702808
multiplication exponent
Pattern(s): 5	
addition subtraction and multiplication are not terribly difficult
you will need to split the numbers into sign mantissa and exponent then use integer math to calculate the result and finally put it back into a float



21710604
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
it makes no sense to notify about removal of children if their parent is subsequently to vanish
the notification about the parent means that the children obviously aren t there anymore



21742086
emma jacoco
Pattern(s): 3	
emma is not going further i think
jacoco works mostly out of the box and is still in development



21745211
printf fgetc
Pattern(s): 1	
the second printf does not contain a space after c which is what was causing out.txt to display weird characters
the reason is that fgetc is retrieving a single byte the same thing as an ascii character not a utf-8 character



21757672
gson jackson
Pattern(s): 2	
if using jackson isn t a requirement then you might want to consider using gson instead
you can tell gson how to deserialize your json by just passing it a json string and the class that you want to deserialize



21795178
datediff difference
Pattern(s): 1	
you can use datediff instead in this case but it s worth being aware that datediff doesn t always do exactly what you might expect it to as it s about boundary crossings
not much of an issue here but it means that the difference between say september 1st and august 31st is 1 month as is the difference between september 30th and august 1st



21807480
int double
Pattern(s): 2	
as stated by ed heal in the comments you should however use int to store dollars amount in cents or according to the smallest of your currency but multiply all amount by 100 to do accurate calculations
float and double are not totally precise because of their binary representation



21820642
clang llvm
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want colored error messages from clang be sure to install the ncurses development package libncurses-devel with cygwin setup beforehand
without it clang will fallback to its colorless mode because llvm wouldn t be able to detect whether the terminal supports colors



21838393
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 2	
uilabel isn t built with textkit on ios7 at least not in a way that is accessible to developers
you d need to use uitextview to get access to textkit



21917518
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
and for me this trick only worked in firefox and not google-chrome
however if in google-chrome you do shift+ctrl+n new incogneto window then go to your editor you ll see that it is working



21954754
disk ram
Pattern(s): 5	
and write through to disk is not contradicting
keeping heavily used data in ram will speed up everything



22041712
pdfsharp migradoc
Pattern(s): 2	
migradoc uses pdfsharp to create pdf files so everything that can be done with migradoc can also be done with pdfsharp only
migradoc supports tables with borders and handles pagebreaks automatically - so for invoices it is most likely a good idea to use migradoc and not pdfsharp



22053405
accelerometer gyroscope
Pattern(s): 3	
however if you are trying to determine device tilt attitude you want to use the gyroscope not the accelerometer
the accelerometer tells how fast the device is moving in each direction



22082136
distance pdist
Pattern(s): 5	
as you can read in the docs you have some options but haverside distance is not within the list of supported metrics
matlab pdist does support the option though see here



22096779
ant maven
Pattern(s): 3	
eventually ant was looking for just 1 content
but maven did not know anything about project.properties which was the problem



22153884
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 5	
in c a struct is not a type by itself the type corresponding to a struct called s is struct s which is usually named via a typedef
in c++ the typedef isn t needed and the syntax is largely irrelevant



22155272
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
a relativelayout cannot size itself based on the size of its children if you want the children to be positioned relative to the parent relativelayout
to put it another way the parent relativelayout cannot size itself based on the size and overall layout of its children imageviews if the children are positioned relative to the size of the parent relativelayout



22183842
cashapelayer calayer
Pattern(s): 5	
cashapelayer doesn t do anything of the kind when it doesn t have a path set so the documentation you reference is misleading
this looks like it might be a copy-paste error in the documentation calayer s shadowpath property includes a similar block of text



22273816
des vigenere
Pattern(s): 1	
as henry points out my statement about double encrypting in des is working from a false assumption
compounding a substitution cipher caeser or vigenere does not actually improve the encryption



22285104
temp tmp
Pattern(s): 5	
temp should not be hello the way you are doing it
if what you want to update tmp i would change the way my_function works a bit



22312105
lxml elementtree
Pattern(s): 5	
lxml is a much better library but if external dependencies are not allowed this will have to do
if you must use elementtree and not lxml



22365693
try-catch exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
if it s only in a job it s ok but if you plan to manage records in other points we warned that if you use nested try-catch blocks the control will go to the outermost try-catch block avoiding internal ones
well there are two or three exception-handling that aren t check programming manual i don t remeber them now they were related to ddbb record blocking and so on



22378439
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
this would assign a javascript click handler to the client-side rendered output of button1
of course button1 still causes a post-back but since it doesn t need to do anything server-side it doesn t even need to be a server-side control



22386937
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
if your cpu doesn t have specialized copy instructions transfer using the word size of the processors
if the processors has 32-bit words transfer 4 bytes at a time with 1 word rather than using 4 8-bit copies



22410157
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
that blue border is google-chrome specific firefox doesn t show it
google-chrome adds the border to links



22417436
pull push
Pattern(s): 5	
to make things worse git fetch git pull and git push are not quite symmetric either
we start out in your own devo-1 branch because of git checkout devo-1 although that does not matter until git pull invokes git merge below



22427143
margin height
Pattern(s): 5	
there will be a warning if the label with margin cannot fit within these limits
if the fixedsize attribute is set to shape the width and height attributes also determine the size of the node shape but the label can be much larger



22428290
uicollectionview uitableview
Pattern(s): 3	
if you want a 2-dimensional table then you want a uicollectionview not a table view
uitableview are strictly one-dimensional with optional grouping into sections



22434694
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
in retrospect what you re trying to do will not get you to make the imageview circular because the default imageview is rectangular the height is always more than the width and so.
setting a corner radius that is half of the height width will not work



22446770
gruntjs grunt-contrib-watch
Pattern(s): 2	
all you need is like 2 hours to learn gruntjs and to configure everything and then everything is done automatically in less than a second
sounds that 1 second which you can even automate to do nothing with grunt-contrib-watch is not really so bad for approximately 5 of improvement even with gzip



22463880
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 2	
but a subclassing can be a delegate of its superclass if the superclass does not implement certain methods and you can enforce that the delegate implements these methods if the superclass specifies the protocol required methods and the subclassing adopts it
in obj-c it is not possible to force subclassing to overwrite methods of its superclass



22470338
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
a subclassing needs a constructor if the superclass does not have a default constructor or has one that is not accessible to the subclassing
if the subclassing has no constructor at all the compiler will automatically create a public constructor that simply calls through to the default constructor of the superclass



22470339
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
if the superclass has explicit constructors all of which take arguments then the subclassing needs an explicit constructor as well since without such a constructor there would be no way to know what arguments the superclass constructor should be called with
if the default superclass constructor accessed through super is available then the subclassing does not need to have an explicit constructor



22476583
rss feed
Pattern(s): 1	
now the rss feed button in your browser should ve become active because an rss feed is available for the page
it shows 10 latest news items in the feed not 5



22496059
cos floor
Pattern(s): 1	
assuming the call to cos was valid secondhandlength isn t defined anywhere
what s more you re dropping the result of your calculation on the floor which isn t what you likely intend to do



22519066
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
first of all types are best tested with identity type x is int not equality and you d use isinstance x int instead to allow for subclasses too
you are dealing with strings here each chars is still a string and type x will never be int



22601776
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
the value returned by fgetc and getc and getchar is an int and not a chars
it has to be an int because the set of values that can be returned includes every possible value of a chars and one extra value eof which is negative whereas the chars are all positive



22628734
converter multibinding
Pattern(s): 3	
first off i m struggling to understand how your current binding expression is actually presenting the sum as your converter seems to just return the foob object itself and not it s sum property - so unless you ve got a specific tostring implementation on your foob class that formats it to present the sum i m completely lost
secondly i think your problem stems from the fact that your multibinding is based off of two properties only - data.selectedid1 and data.selectedid2 therefore unless either of those two properties change the multibinding is not going to receive a propertychanged event and update



22630313
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
chars to int is of course a widening conversion
but int to chars is not as you seem to be thinking based on second switch statement



22750382
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
the subclassing is a form of the superclass the superclass is not a form of the sub class
that is because the superclass does not have that method



22754927
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
when you call a method using the super keyword you re specifying that you want to use your superclass s implementation of that method
if your subclassing doesn t override a method defined in super then performing the selector on self will trigger a miss on your class s method lookup table and find the method definition on your superclass



22772730
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
a float double isn t built like an int type
int s are straight-forward binary numbers maybe with a sign



22780626
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
the code actually works but there is an error in the method for-loop that cause a indexoutofbound exception this is the correct version
the method returns void but you can read the modify values inside the arrays because you are passing as method argument the reference of the arrays not a copy of the arrays



22795556
ciimage uiimage
Pattern(s): 3	
it merely provides a reference to the ciimage that is already the basis of this uiimage
but this uiimage does not have a ciimage basis



22810472
free malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
yes it is undefined to free an object that you allocated with new primarily because free does not invoke class destructors
similarly for delete ing something you created with malloc to do so would be to mix two different allocation construction idioms and although you can make it work it would be spectacularly difficult to do so robustly



22810767
addslashes htmlspecialchars
Pattern(s): 3	
addslashes is particularly poor for inserting data into html since is not an escape character in html
you want htmlspecialchars not addslashes



22810767
addslashes htmlspecialchars
Pattern(s): 3	
you want htmlspecialchars not addslashes
there is almost always a better escaping mechanism than addslashes for any situation and when there isn t addslashes is rarely sufficient so you need to write one



22848579
xwpf hwpf
Pattern(s): 5	
as per apache poi docs for docx you have to use xwpf not hwpf apis
hwpf is the name of our port of the microsoft word 97 -2007 file



22894297
conduit parsec
Pattern(s): 5	
a streaming data library like pipes or conduit would allow you to avoid reading the entire file into memory at once though- to my knowledge- parsec doesn t provide a streaming interface to allow this to happen
attoparsec on the other hand does include such a streaming interface and both pipes and conduit have attoparsec adapter libraries data.conduit.attoparsec



22900229
maven-release-plugin pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
so long story less long maven-release-plugin does not work as expected when the local directory structure does not match the remote one
now i have to checkout honoring the server path and also create a new pom.xml or move the parent pom.xml to the project root to get it to work.



22923388
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	
basic straight hash have not been considered safe for years
md5 has been outright broken for years



22966549
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
one of the most common mistakes in hashing is that hash are not unique to the users
this is mainly because salt are not uniquely generated



23009371
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
tcp udp are elaborate protocols rules that govern how the two applications connect exchange data and terminate the connection
udp does not have the connect terminating phase btw.



23036819
arraylist treeset
Pattern(s): 3	
then we could use treeset to sort an array faster than the method made specifically to sort it the saving gotten from not having to insert into the arraylist is fairly small
if this were consistently true java developers would simply replace that method with treeset wouldn t they



23056738
http spdy
Pattern(s): 5	
after 1 http request follows 1 response
you cannot send content type text csv and content type text html at the same time maybe yes with spdy but not with pure http



23075702
spaces linefeed
Pattern(s): 1	
also notepad++ can show white spaces chars including new lines which can be handy in such cases
it is probably the application or system you are using to view your file ignoring the linefeed not c# ignoring it



23129099
pyenv virtualenv
Pattern(s): 5	
you can remove pyenv and install latest version of virtualenv and ask virtualenv to create the env for you by this command
if you re using the latest version of virtualenv --no-site-packages isn t necessary anymore



23135113
gruntjs package.json
Pattern(s): 1	
run npm install grunt-cli -g if gruntjs is not found message gets displayed
your package.json is not a valid json



23151227
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 5	
so you need to redirect stderr of strace to stdout before piping to grep
this is because strace writes all its output to stderr not stdout



23160505
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
if your for-loop doesn t have data inter-dependences you can simply change it to parfor and matlab will start parallel pools to take advantage of multicore processor parallel computing
even if your data is interlaced inside for loops you can do some trick to get rid of it declare addition matrix arrays to hold another copy of the data structure trade memory usage for speed



23198273
andar vuforia
Pattern(s): 1	
andar is not the state of the art option but it works very well if you want to create a marker based application with an open source sdk
as mentioned vuforia is an excellent free option to create more sophisticate applications including markerless apps



23228485
textview imageview
Pattern(s): 5	
i think that if you were to set on the textview s you d get what you were looking for
it looks like it s laying them out to the right of the imageview but not giving them any width at layout time since they don t ask for any and they don t have any content



23237065
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
the internal representation of the integer doesn t really matter
the fact that a signed -1 converts to the maximum value of a similar unsigned integer is interesting but not directly significant



23287218
clang llvm
Pattern(s): 5	
you will need to modify quite a bit of code for example there are portions of type definitions in ... llvm tools clang lib sema sema.cpp and ... llvm tools clang lib ast type.cpp
if you grep for int128 good choice as clang itself doesn t use that much in itself as opposed to for example size_t you will see that it turns up in a lot of places



23303384
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
when a jar is in the release repo maven doesn t automatically download a newer revision if the user is using an older revision
maven will integrate with your revision control system and automatically update the pom.xml to change the version to a non-snapshot number



23304936
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 1	
newer versioning of cassandra may use new sstable or commitlog formats which the older versioning will not be able to read
2.even if it s a rolling upgrade i think the following steps will do except moving from one versioning to another



23320412
nsdata nsjsonserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
make sure you are passing nsdata and not nsmutabledata to the method that does the serialization to make sure
remember that nsjsonserialization is not a streaming json parser



23335882
ienumerable iqueryable
Pattern(s): 5	
the warning exists because an ienumerable can disguise something expensive such as a database call most likely an iqueryable and as ienumerable doesn t have caching as part of it s contract it will re-enumerate the source fresh
this can lead to performance issues later on we have been stung by this a surprising amount and we don t even use iqueryable ours was on domain model traversal



23399507
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
while you already know that udp is not reliable you maybe missed the other advantages of tcp
relevant for you is that tcp has flow control and automatically scales down if the receiver is unable to cope with the senders speed packet loss



23432500
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
the salt is added to the password before hashing to ensure that the hash isn t useable in a rainbow table attack
because the salt is randomly generated each time you call the function the resulting password hash is also different



23435637
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
edit this is simply a limitation of stun not of sctp so google-chrome could do nothing about it if they wanted to
firefox does not support sctp over tcp anyways



23478172
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 5	
and whether the app is a daemons or not is also irrelevant
what s relevant is whether the operating systemd considers your device to be a keyboard or not



23489038
org.json jackson
Pattern(s): 3	
your gist shows org.json code not jackson
jackson has a perfectly able .equals implementation for all jsonnode s



23507404
libsvm liblinear
Pattern(s): 3	
not to mention that the algorithms are coded with different goals in mind libsvm is written in a way to allow switching between different kernel functions while liblinear is optimized to always be linear and have no concept of kernels at all
which is why libsvm is not easily applicable to large scale problems even with a linear kernel and often it is suggested to use liblinear when you have large number of instances



23507404
libsvm liblinear
Pattern(s): 1	
which is why libsvm is not easily applicable to large scale problems even with a linear kernel and often it is suggested to use liblinear when you have large number of instances
furthermore regarding multi-class problems with k classes libsvm by default implements the one-against-one approach by constructing binary classifiers while liblinear implements the one-vs-the-rest strategy by constructing k binary classifiers it also has an alternative method by crammer and singer for handling multi-class problems



23523608
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
meteor public folder not working
use . public directory for serving static assets



23526485
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to use .htaccess files you will need to install apache which is a web server using a different heavier architecture
nginx doesn t support .htaccess files that is an apache feature



23532944
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome has its own implementation but you won t get it working firefox
this is not working because firefox does not support animations on background images



23532974
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome has its own implementation but you won t get it working firefox
this is not working because firefox does not support animations on background images



23610627
strtod strtok
Pattern(s): 1	
if you just want everything they enter to be a single int walk the string and look for isdigit on each chars and then when you find that it is all just digits call strtod if not emit an error and re-prompt
if you want multiple things parse from the same input line then you need to parse the string with something like strtok to get individual tokens one at a time then look at each token and determine if it is a number by looking to see if each chars isdigit or is equal to - . and suchlike



23611936
screens tablet
Pattern(s): 1	
use relative values for the screens layout not pixels or dp
the root cause is that one of your tablet is reporting an incorrect pixel density



23614666
java.util.date simpledateformat
Pattern(s): 5	
it s very important to understand that a java.util.date doesn t have any notion of a time zone as part of its data - it s just an instant in time
to format a date in a particular time zone you d usually use a simpledateformat and specify the time zone on that



23640336
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome would not display the files and ie compatibility mode would corrupt them
i did not test it in firefox before finding a solution



23666320
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
but i would recommend avoiding the for-loop and using the function mat2cell ... instead like this
in this case a 3d cell arrays is not advisable



23674340
fileoutputstream bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 5	
again fileoutputstream has a constructor allowing you to append instead of overwriting
the bufferedwriter isn t the problem - it s the way you re constructing the filewriter



23678356
bids ssis
Pattern(s): 5	
for me this error has nothing to do with ssis and occurred after end tasking not responding bids
one of my excel files was get locked by bids debugger dtsdebughost.exe which closing bids does not helps



23787824
pop-up dialog
Pattern(s): 5	
all links with a data-rel pop-up inside a pop-up will not do anything at all
on the other hand dialog is a variation of a classic jquery mobile page just with large margin and semi transparent overlay



23809506
factors matrix
Pattern(s): 1	
the unknown scale factors cannot be responsible for the reconstruction errors you see
regardless of global scale the result of projecting onto the image pair a 3d point estimated from good matches and with a valid essential matrix should be consistent



23828748
mp4 webm
Pattern(s): 1	
the mp4 video doesn t work under firefox 29.
but the webm version is ok



23860302
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
i just found a partial solution to google-chrome not invalving flash javascript extra dom manipulation with overflow hidden
firefox has fixed this bug



23879930
median percentile
Pattern(s): 1	
notice the median does not appear because we kept its closest neighbor instead weight 3 180
also percentile 75 has two associated mpg values



23893670
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
first - your for-loop is not true i don t think you meant it to be this way
it s supposed to be as arrays initiallized by a constant size are starting from 0 and going on to size-1 so an arrays would have and not



23896165
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql is also open source like mysql but far more featureful and supports check constraints
one big difference is that mysql does not support check constraints which is an important part of maintaining database integrity



23999289
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
if you re using compass the current stable versioning does not seem to support sass maps but the 1.0 does
i have also had the same error and was running sass 3.3.7 an upgrade to sass 3.3.8 didn t work but installing the alpha versioning of compass did fix it



24006850
ssl https
Pattern(s): 3	
io socket ssl does not provide its own proxy hacks like crypt ssleay does and lwp https proxy support as documented using proxy method or env_proxy was broken
with version 6.06 of both lwp useragent and lwp protocol https which are now seperate distributions



24019895
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
superclass deinitializers are always
called even if a subclassing does not provide its own deinitializer



24024067
arraylist treeset
Pattern(s): 5	
if you don t add an comparator the treeset implicitly expects the arraylist to realize the comparable-interface which it does not do
the treeset doesn t know how to sort the arraylists because there is no natural ordering for lists



24030341
teamcity octopack
Pattern(s): 5	
i found it by going through the teamcity build log and looking for duplicates
as they were do not copy there was no issue with a simple msbuild but as we just switched to using octopack cannot add multiple when nugeting a solution...



24041046
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
an unsigned chars value is still promoted to int when passed to printf so to be fully correct you should explicitly convert it to unsigned int
strictly speaking the unsigned int isn t necessary



24042898
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
you can work around the issue by wrapping your c++ code with objective-c and using the objective c wrapper in swift
swift is not directly compatible with c++



24047298
public protected
Pattern(s): 3	
one could stick to a single property if that was made public so implementing implicitly but in that case the property would be exposed much more which is apparently not desired
a protected property cannot implement an interface property implicitly or explicitly



24064278
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	
the cpu does not interpret machine code - it executes it directly - that s why it is called machine code
a processors typically has a register called a program counter pc this starts on reset at a location normally known as the reset vector which is either fixed for the processors or is loaded from a fixed location and is incremented to the next instruction after each non-branching sequential instruction is executed



24069480
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
the only ways this would not throw an error at runtime is if you passed an empty arrays as a method argument in which case the for-loop would not execute
also as bhesh suggests if the arrays has one element and the minidx is that first element at index 0 loops will execute once enter the first if and continue

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the only ways this would not throw an error at runtime is if you passed an empty arrays as a method argument in which case the for-loop would not execute

24090150
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
a for-loop that invokes a cursor automatically fetches the row once for each loops
the fetch you added inside loops isn t allowed



24092276
free malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
finally like i stated in a comment to another answer the object will often have a hidden header that stores the size of the object so that a subsequent free can know how large a block is being returned
while your code will keep track of the total amount of memory request via malloc it isn t really keeping track of the total amount of memory used by the objects that are returned



24101965
exif jfif
Pattern(s): 1	
the exif format defines various tags that you can use with that format
jfif does not have tags but has some limited metadata



24107357
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
maven uses this variable to build your project so java_home and the compiler plugin version must match
just changing the java version in your pom.xml is not good enough



24156883
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
when you _shapes.splice shape.index 1 you shift everything after shape.index towards the beginning of the arrays but your for-loop doesn t know that
the result is that you ve removed the desired element and loops won t see the next element



24161287
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
when you run the goal archetype create-from-project maven generates a pom.xml file for building the archetype at target generated-sources archetype pom.xml and then runs the package goal by default on this pom.xml
the generated pom.xml file doesn t have project.build.sourceencoding or any other property defining encoding and that s why you get the warning



24164935
ant maven
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are running the maven build from the command line or in eclipse but using an alternate jre in the jre tab of the run configuration ant will not recognize the property
if you try to run the maven build using the workspace jre however it may recognize it because the property is defined in the eclipse workspace configuration



24178293
opendj openam
Pattern(s): 5	
if you use openam lockout mechanism then this won t set opendj s account status but sets a value to the configured account status attribute
currently openam does not have any interface where you can plug into when and account is being locked



24181029
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 2	
don t expect vb.net samples to work in vb6
the two languages are incompatible on a number of levels not just because vb6 doesn t use the .net framework



24221215
mapbox nominatim
Pattern(s): 3	
i m not sure where this assumption is coming from mapbox uses an entirely different geocoder carmen than nominatim as well as a different server cdn and everything else
what you re seeing is that nominatim doesn t support cors and mapbox does



24224614
caliburn.micro mef
Pattern(s): 5	
taken straight from caliburn.micro s mef-bootstrapper
it looks like mef cannot construct the iwindowmanager which is a dependency of your viewmodel



24225289
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
md5 is a hash not a compression thing
md5 is not reversable



24228830
nixos cabal
Pattern(s): 5	
nixos does not force you to have your command line and path cultured with tools you do not necessarily need
cabal assumes the existence a few standard tools such as ar patch i think and a few others as well if memory services me right



24267142
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
if you access a small percentage of children and you want all parent lazy loading may be better - when you need to see the parent before deciding on whether to check the children or not and most of your decisions turn out that you do not check the children go for the lazy loading a round-trip or two wouldn t hurt as much as bringing ten or twenty times more data than you need
there are situations when you cannot read the whole hierarcy - for example because only the immediate parent id is available



24291748
nsdictionary restkit
Pattern(s): 5	
it could be a little bit drastic but you can try to subclass nsdictionary to replace the implementation of the method
i say that it is drastic because subclassing a class cluster like nsdictionary is never easy and you will have to do many tests to be sure that restkit doesn t complain about this



24331918
subtraction addition
Pattern(s): 3	
subtraction is also described there
edit since its not clear if the op meant unsigned addition thats also not too hard to detect



24334968
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
aside from the fact that you re comparing a double and an int and have no idea which one will be casted to the other s type you re comparing floating point numbers with the operator
comparing floats and double doesn t work like this because



24338964
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 3	
however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx
disadvantages of moving to nginx - not many but things to keep in mind



24342583
filesystems fat
Pattern(s): 5	
note if you are using the default file-based session handler your filesystems must keep track of access times atime
windows fat does not so you will have to come up with another way to handle garbage collecting your session if you are stuck with a fat filesystems or any other filesystems where atime tracking is not available



24411343
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
with udp you cannot send messages bigger than 64kb
use tcp or split the payload yourself into multiple messages which will be extremely complex because messages can be lost



24457397
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
note that swift does have a full implementation of generics
objective-c does not have generics so nsarray and nsmutablearray are not strongly typed in the way you desire



24477743
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
superclass cannot handle subclassing exceptions
subclassing can replace wrap superclass methods not the other way round



24489745
puma unicorn
Pattern(s): 1	
puma can spawn many workers and each worker can use many threads to process the request
unicorn does not have threads as far as i know it just has the worker model



24509090
arduino teensy
Pattern(s): 1	
i have started using teensy which is arduino compatible and it works pretty well
arduino does not support the boot protocol



24537049
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
see also get a user-readable version of the class name in swift in objective-c nsstringfromclass was fine
swift does not have the introspection capabilities yet as objective-c does



24540046
spaces delimiter
Pattern(s): 1	
the spaces is 2nd line is important for the nextdouble to identify the piece of text to read as double
this default delimiter does not apply when nextline is used to read as it reads upto end of line



24550907
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
ie doesn t allow file access when running locally and google-chrome requires --allow-file-access-from-files flag to be set when you launch the browser
firefox doesn t have these restrictions so your project would work as you expect there



24568379
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
the number of concurrent requests are limited by the number of children threads yes but apache is not spawning a new thread child for every request which would be ridiculously slow even with threads creation and teardown for every request would be way too slow
nginx uses a master-worker model



24579873
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
regarding your reply remember swift isn t fully baked yet and there may be many more apis available to us in future releases such as a unique set api reflection etc
this should not deter you from learning swift as well as objective-c so don t give up



24600299
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
some other databases oracle db2 postgresql have the function translate for it
unfortunately mysql does not support it



24645106
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
as noted in that bug page google-chrome has similar behavior on other special elements like and though it does happen to accept custom display styling on for some reason
firefox does not in any case. to fix this you need to set display flex on a wrapper-div inside of the instead of on the itself



24653125
phpmyadmin heidisql
Pattern(s): 5	
but if phpmyadmin hangs i d try to execute your query my mysqlc or another mysql client like heidisql
i use heidisql not phpmyadmin and your query works fine here



24693609
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
if the outcome of any client-side code is a boolean true value server-side code runs
otherwise server-side code doesn t run



24718253
unix bsd
Pattern(s): 5	
the original unix does not use threads for multiprogramming
an article from 1987 comparing the mach and unix kernel states that neither unix system v nor 4.3 bsd provide a way to manage more than one thread of control within an address space



24718253
freebsd opensolaris
Pattern(s): 5	
i have once traced the current 1 1 freebsd threading implementation to an article in kerneltrap
opensolaris doesn t seem to describe its own threading implementation on man pages



24722635
autoresize scrollbar
Pattern(s): 3	
autoresize is not autofit
it is for sizing columns based on the header text extent or content length not managing scrollbar and works very well



24738123
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
a string whose length is given by a signed int can have up to 2 31 chars 2 147 483 647
however since objects are also capped at 2gb 2 31 chars is not the actual limit



24759868
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
this will however prevent browsing directly to a folder and getting a directory listing which should not be a problem
the next line in the htaccess will allow you to link to asset files contained in your admin directory and not have them get processed by laravel so that should not be removed



24774320
viewdidload viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 3	
viewdidload is called once and only once when the view gets loaded
in your situitation viewwillappear might not work as well because it s only called only if the view gets loaded on the canvas



24789557
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 3	
but the cpu doesn t know anything about objects and their constructors for the processors it s just a pair of assignments that can be reordered if the cpu s memory model allows it
of course compiler and jvm may instruct the cpu not to reorder these assignments by placing memory barriers in the generated code but doing so for all objects will ruin performance of the cpus that may heavily rely on such an aggressive optimizations



24794089
qtimer qthread
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want the timer to live in the other thread as well qtimer start is a slot
inheriting from qthread is not the recommended usage



24802855
tabs tabpanel
Pattern(s): 1	
individual tabs do not have ids only tabpanels have ids
a tabpanel has multiple tabs



24836566
clang llvm
Pattern(s): 5	
clang converts c c++ etc to llvm if llvm performs optimizations on the if and the llvm x86 backend writes out x86 machine code for execution
despite the name llvm is not a virtual machine in the traditional sense - it is a computation model and representation that lends itself well to the task of manipulating code



24840933
wma asf
Pattern(s): 1	
afaik wma doesn t have an in-built container specification like mp3 and hence is dependent on other container formats like asf and avi
most asf files have wma audio content and hence if your device supports asf files you should be able to play them



24855611
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
this is a snippet of code from an application i developed a little time as i had very few pictures put the assets folder and used the universalimagerloager lib to manage the loading of images to views
the internal directory is not accessible by the wizard when you create the first instance of your class database one that extends sqliteopenhelper your nome_banco.db is created in that folder data data package_name databases nome_banco.db if you install on avd you can navigate to that directory by ddms



24881403
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted
udp does not have this features so it can t guarantee that



24894645
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
i get how to assign each individual element one by one in a for-loop but i don t get how to individually pick one element out and assign it without touching the other elements
note that the question asks for you to assign x to the arrays element not the other way around it will look like



24901814
mouseleave mouseenter
Pattern(s): 5	
maybe when the mouseenter event trigger the ddsmoothmenu do something and it doesnot finish before the mouseleave event trigger
finally i found the reason the event to collapse all menu should be mouseleave not hover



24945814
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome adjusts the file size to 0 when you delete a file
sadly firefox does not do this



24947269
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
innodb was not a default storage engine until mysql 5.5
in my case myisam was the default storage engine and did not support the transactions



24961193
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
according to microsoft the value of counter after the parallel for-loop should be the same as it was prior to entering loops though i don t know if this is general or implementation-specific behavior
the iteration variable of your omp parallel for-loop isn t counter it s i which has a type of size_t not long long



24961193
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the iteration variable of your omp parallel for-loop isn t counter it s i which has a type of size_t not long long
your issue is that you declare counter as private in loops which according to here means that a new counter object is created for each thread and all references to the original object are replaced by new ones



24996408
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
if the second for-loop doesn t find divisors then i is prime
the two nested loops don t have the same value because they are nested



25057095
screens tablet
Pattern(s): 3	
well sure but that screens is far larger than 600dp in its smallest width
but what ever changes i make for this enormous tablet shouldn t affect normal tablet which would happen if i change stuff in that folder



25058826
cdr cons
Pattern(s): 5	
in this case cdr would not be part of tree structure
note that while the car 1b component of each such cons is part of the



25107770
free memset
Pattern(s): 5	
free a will release the buffer pointed by a but this buffer contains pointers and each of the buffers that is pointed by them will not be free
in short - memset does not free a dynamically allocated buffer and free does not set it to zero



25134086
clearinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 3	
so here make sure to clearinterval before assigning it again or use a flag with settimeout or requestanimationframe
javascript timers setinterval settimeout are not efficient because they continue to run when browser window is minimized or other tab is open thereby wasting cpu cycles



25136177
ienumerable idictionary
Pattern(s): 1	
ienumerable is covariant
idictionary is not



25151366
ubuntu mint
Pattern(s): 5	
ubuntu 14.04 has glfw 2 packaged as libglfw2 and libglfw-dev
mint doesn t seem to have those packages but you can probably use the ubuntu ones since mint 17 is based on ubuntu 14.04



25164304
decimal ieee
Pattern(s): 5	
if an approximate result is good enough and there are lots of calculations where it is you can use double but be aware that it s a binary floating point number and accurate rounding to decimal might not always be possible
although in certain cases it might work in general there is no way to determine force the decimal precision of a double value or indeed any ieee floating point number



25189541
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
i think the right solution is to call bc.completeadding after the for-loop not in an impossible condition inside it
i believe the problem is that you never call bc.completeadding the if means it would be called in ports + 1 -th iteration of loops but loops iterates only ports -times



25224188
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
the key was realizing that everything had to be done from the application folder itself not from within the mamp folder
as it turns out the issue was pathing and how the home root of the directory is determined by mamp



25237459
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
the md5 hash is not available for every object
while most objects have an md5 hash many objects do not



25248265
lambdify sympy
Pattern(s): 2	
you can use sympy to evaluate the derivative and then use lambdify to convert that expression into a function that can be used with scipy
note that lambdify currently doesn t know about scipy by default so you ll have to add a translation dictionary for the scipy special functions manually



25264206
qnetworkrequest qnetworkreply
Pattern(s): 5	
you are trying to connect a signal of the class qnetworkreply coming from an object of unrelated class qnetworkrequest
additionally qnetworkrequest doesn t inherit from qobject



25302983
ienumerable ilist
Pattern(s): 1	
and since ilist inherits from ienumerable you can call where on both interfaces calling where on a ilist actually calls the ienumerable.where extension method
so in both cases the same base method is called and the type of the resulting value will be an ienumerable not an ilist when applied to a list



25324323
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome which uses a newer version of v8 throws an error if you don t use new
i m not sure why firefox doesn t throw an error though



25343871
free alloca
Pattern(s): 5	
similarly using calloc which also allocates from the heap should be followed by the use free to deallocate the memory when done with it
the other memory allocator such as alloca which allocates from the stack and not the heap see on the use and abuse of alloca does not use the free function and that memory will be recovered automatically as the stack pointers are adjusted when the function in which it is used returns



25353651
salt md5
Pattern(s): 3	
md5 is ways too fast and one should include a random salt
because of the salt you cannot just recalculate the hash and compare it with the stored hash



25373203
xmlhttprequest xdomainrequest
Pattern(s): 3	
once you include the xhr-xdr-adapter you can use the standard xmlhttprequest and not worry about whether you re running on ie 8 9 or not as long as you don t need to do something fancy like send custom headers or use a method other than get or post.
the code above won t work because the api for ie s xdomainrequest is slightly different from that of xmlhttprequest



25376828
background-image background-size
Pattern(s): 1	
background-image isn t supposed to be animatable in the first place
on the other hand background-size can be animated but it s very clear from your css that you don t want to transition background-size



25420905
viewdidload viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 5	
you should use viewdidappear not viewdidload
viewdidload means view was loaded to memory but not drawn



25445352
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 1	
the tryanchordownload approach should work on modern versions of firefox and google-chrome and is a cleaned-up version of code provided in this forum post
the trysaveasdownload approach should theoretically work on any major modern browser though safari may not respect the specified file name



25480887
free malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
this makes it safe to free them all since free null is valid and does nothing
the memory returned by malloc is not initialized



25487577
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
and the vim folder was also not in my root directory but was usr share vim vim73
i discovered by running scriptnames that the vimrc that it was loading was not from my root directory but was usr share vim vimrc



25489717
opera safari
Pattern(s): 1	
i ran into this issue and found that the problem was google-chrome opera and firefox safari have different tolerances for creating a new javascript date object
this works in google-chrome and opera but not firefox and safari



25493270
openmpi mpich
Pattern(s): 1	
openmpi has only recently supported mpi-3 and i find that some mpi-3 features are buggy on some platforms mpich is not bug-free of course but bugs in mpi-3 features have been far less common
historically openmpi has not had holistic support for mpi_thread_multiple which is critical for some applications



25493378
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
yes i know that is the default scope of dependencies but for some reason maven was not capable of the job
see a piece of my pom.xml that made the problem disapear



25496079
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
letting subclass1 call through to a constructor of superclass over the head of its own superclass would break encapsulation of superclass
you cannot skip levels of the constructor if the class in the middle subclassing does not expose a constructor that calls a particular constructor of superclass subclassing of subclassing no longer have an ability to access these constructors



25528114
jgit egit
Pattern(s): 1	
edit a pgm package in jgit provides the inverse mapping command-line interface git commands implemented using jgit pgm stands for program
egit does not use the git executables



25533525
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem with io format is that if your int doesn t fit you get asterisks
the problem with string right is that it throws away the chars that don t fit



25536294
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	
so the mismatch of hash types is quite obvious
setting security sethash md5 isn t going to do anything since the hashtype set in auth config will take priority



25540809
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
maven ---- update project
if your pom.xml is not specific as to the version of the maven-resources-plugin that version will come from the superpom

filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 5	
if the filesystems is not ntfs or the user you are running under does not have rights to modify the ntfs settings edit or ntfs file encryption is disabled you won t be able to use the file.encrypt functions
file.encrypt does ntfs file encryption



25564681
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
the idle state is a hardware state the cpu is not running code just waiting for some event to occur scheduling timer or i o interrupt that signals the processors to run code
a 8086 processors can achieve the idle state by executing the hlt halt instruction



25576837
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
you need to pass int s to robot.keypress int not chars s
the best thing to do would probably be to get the chars s int value



25583787
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
a for-loop does not create a new scope
that means if within loops you re registering an event handler that relies on the values of local variables during loops pass you ll need a closure to wrap the values with the handler



25642147
entity-relationship diagram
Pattern(s): 3	
entity-relationship modeling is very parallel to object modeling except that object modeling models behavior as well as data and entity-relationship modeling only models data
the problem with learning entity-relationship modeling for this purpose is that in the present state of affairs most of the professionals who use entity-relationship diagram do not use them to depict a conceptual model



25656262
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 5	
for instance quicksort does not have a tight bound unless we are talking specifically about either best average or worst case analysis as it s ω nlogn in the best and average cases but o n 2 in the worst case
on the other hand mergesort is both ω nlogn and o nlogn therefore it s also θ nlogn



25687277
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
the else statement is connected to the for-loop not the except block
using an else clause on a for-loop is perfectly fine and it will be executed if loops exhaust the list it is iterating over



25712222
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 1	
the specific reasons why a function might not be inline when the inline keyword aren t documented by microsoft
the closest i can find is the documentation for compiler warning c4710 . the inline keyword is only a hint and the compiler uses heuristics to determine whether inlining is a worthwhile optimization



25714385
distance polygons
Pattern(s): 5	
offset the polygons inwards by distance circle s radius
if the resulting polygons is still a valid polygons is not self-intersecting and maintain the same vertices traversing orientation check if the circle s center is inside the offset polygons



25788405
directx gdi
Pattern(s): 2	
its possible that wpf can get around this since it uses directx to handle its drawing
since winforms uses gdi there isn t a lot of support for floating precision within drawing



25808990
entity-relationship diagram
Pattern(s): 5	
unlike most people i prefer to make a sharp distinction between diagram that depict an entity-relationship model and ones that depict a relational model
contrary to prevailing opinion entity-relationship modeling isn t just relational lite



25827994
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
no a class must be defined in swift or in objective-c not mixed language inside single class file sorry
as you may have already noticed a class in swift is generally made by a single file with .swift extension while objective-c class is defined using two files .h and .m

children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
parent process not known of changes in children
and children cant pass results to parent



25859376
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	
this is because cryptographic hash functions are designed with certain properties which also explains why md5 is not suitable in such a role
the ideal cryptographic hash function has four main properties



25927588
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 5	
now if you can configure the nix cron like igor parra answered the background and offset cron jobs will not run any more where as the time set in the control panel or crontab will be in effect
it seems that every one has just answered the way a nix cron should be setup



25928417
vbscript vba
Pattern(s): 2	
see here for more information about translating vba to vbscript
vbscript doesn t provide implicit parent objects like the vba runtime environment does so you need to make everything explicit



25938890
gruntjs package.json
Pattern(s): 3	
i think you are confusing gruntjs with npm because the gruntjs cannot handle dependencies it s simply a task runner
the package.json file is here because you need the devdependencies for the gruntjs installation and all its plugins like grunt-contrib-concat



25995517
rpm yum
Pattern(s): 5	
it might be possible to play with marking them as config files and then modifying them so that rpm won t remove them but it might still rename them and i don t know if this will actually work
if you are manually copying the files to some directory in post for example then yum rpm doesn t know anything about them and can t remove them



25999518
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
the idiom is for objective-c not swift
in swift init blocks aren t normal functions and don t return anything



26012210
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp is used by default for group membership and can be swithed off to tcp for example if you are running in a cloud environment where udp is not suitable
for session replication on the other hand tcp is used org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.replicationtransmitter



26027410
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
the salt doesn t make it slower to calculate hash it just means they have to crack each user s password individually and pre-computed hash tables buzz-word rainbow tables are made completely useless
if you don t have a precomputed hash-table and you re only cracking one password hash salting doesn t make any difference



26027410
pbkdf2 hash
Pattern(s): 5	
you should use an artificially slowed down entropy-enducing method such as pbkdf2 described in pkcs#5.
putting a low entropy password through a hash doesn t increase entropy



26046388
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
in case of ie google-chrome uses windows certificate storage the same as ie the intermediate certificate is already installed on your computer that s why ie and google-chrome don t complain
firefox doesn t have that certificate installed and firefox has own certificate storage



26052765
mongodb dbref
Pattern(s): 5	
mongodb does not support join.trying to use join would defeat the purpose of mongodb
you could use dbref and write your application code so that it automatically fetches these references for you



26054790
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if the command was successful the is an equivalent to if there are no errors the folder is now the current active directory so remove anything inside it rmdir
s q as it is the current directory it can not be deleted the hides the error output when the current folder can not be removed



26076620
mvp presenter
Pattern(s): 5	
in the classic mvc pattern both the view and controller access the model whereas only the presenter has access in mvp
also note that in mvp not all business logic is necessarily located in the presenter



26081179
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
in my case using ajax the function was being call asynchronously so the setinterval wouldn t care if a result was returned
b if i changed the code to use settimeout i could control the outcome more



26094437
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
so your call to realloc may not have resulted in a physical page being returned to the system so it s still mapped to you program and can be used
however a following call to malloc could use that space or it could be reclaimed by the system at any time



26124108
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
following code allows to check if certain folder exists in apk bundle
aasetmanager_opendir will always return a pointer to initialized object even if the specified directory doesn t exist



26185483
fgetc toupper
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to read character by character from the keyboard use fgetc not scanf
use the c-runtime function isalpha toupper to recognize a character



26256643
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 2	
swift currently doesn t do much in the direction of reflection and metaprogramming
you ll have to resolve to using objective-c to do this



26260499
abc subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
such a subclassing is not good form and its instances are not truly interchangeable with instances of class abc
if class abc has accessible properties of mutable types mutable containers then you may need to do something to prevent those objects from being mutated too



26265858
gdcm pydicom
Pattern(s): 2	
you can use gdcm to do that
since pydicom do not support compressed dicom files you will have to decompress it first



26275528
vbscript vba
Pattern(s): 5	
vbscript not essential but preferred by me as controling script
vba to move the mouse



26285749
jython pypy
Pattern(s): 1	
jython doesn t deal in pointers it deals in java references which the jvm of course probably represents as pointers but you can t see those and wouldn t want to because the gc is allowed to move them around
pypy lets different types have different kinds of id but the most general is just an index into a table of objects you ve called id on which is obviously not going to be a pointer



26289863
qtreewidget qtreeview
Pattern(s): 5	
as mumush mentions andrea s answer applies to the qtreewidget only not a qtreeview
qtreeview has no selecteditems method so you have to use selectedindexes which will return you a list of qmodelindex objects



26296778
kerberos ldap
Pattern(s): 1	
3269 is not kerberos this is ssl-backed global catalog
pure ldap not kerberos



26312769
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
please take care you give permission to only images folder and not the other folder
as per the error i think that the images directory must have the read-write permission so that images can be stored into it



26321638
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
the modulo operator is meant to work with int not double
remember double numbers are floating-point numbers so there s always room for numerical error if you use them



26348924
uitableview uipickerview
Pattern(s): 1	
if so rather than use a uitableview why not use a uipickerview also placed below above beside the labels
a uipickerview would accomplish the same thing only in a vertical representation



26356487
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
since udp does have a length field in its header it turns out that the same field is now used twice in order to calculate the udp checksum
it can be argued that the udp length in the udp header is itself redundant for the same reason that tcp does not contain a similar field



26356487
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
it can be argued that the udp length in the udp header is itself redundant for the same reason that tcp does not contain a similar field
i am given to understand that the reason for that is also historic and has to do with udp being defined before ipv4 was finalized



26369394
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 1	
there my uilabel were localized properly on the device not in the simulator
however my uitextview did not get localized which took me another 30 minutes to figure out



26374568
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
here was my problem if i put the mp4 line first google-chrome would play the video part but there would be no sound
if i put the webm line first google-chrome would play the video and sound correctly but apple safari would not detect the video at all



26431615
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
consuming cpu time doesn t necessarily require executing something complex just that the cpu is kept busy
multiple web services calls may take time to execute but won t necessarily tie up the cpu as the processors may do other things while it waits for the i o involved with the service calls to complete



26479138
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
last i checked in google-chrome it couldn t process the output of webrtc through webaudio while firefox can
however there are two bugs blocking firefox from taking webaudio-generated source streams in a peerconnection one of which has now been fixed in nightly aurora and the other should be shortly



26486329
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
swift does not use a preprocessor so pragma flags and macros are not an option
it is still possible though to provide similar functionality to the nlog and fixme macros used with objective-c by making use of the benign warning treating a forced downcast as optional will never produce nil



26488501
qgraphicsview qgraphicsitem
Pattern(s): 5	
a qgraphicsview is a widget so it has a doubleclickevent
in contrast a qgraphicsitem is not a widget but has a mousepressevent



26491618
entity-relationship diagram
Pattern(s): 1	
an entity-relationship diagram is more abstract
sql server let you create a physical data model diagram that could come from a entity-relationship diagram or not



26494444
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
so int is not a correct representation for them
what you need is a different text-converter something that takes an int and another int specifying a base and spits out the chars to represent your number



26494754
lxml elementtree
Pattern(s): 1	
update based on the new information that lxml.html is the parsing library lxml doesn t use pure xpath in the same way pure xml libraries might
instead it s a marriage of xpath and the elementtree elementtree that s common to a lot of python xml html parsing libraries salted with a handful of its own homespun approaches



26520278
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
if you can not switch to postgresql try using innodb
1235 this version of mysql doesn t yet support limit



26559063
vbo vao
Pattern(s): 1	
in this case the vbo is automatically unbound from the currently bound vao but not from other vaos that are not currently bound
if other vaos have references to the vbo the vbo will stay alive until all those bindings are broken or the vaos deleted



26559967
autocompletetextview spinner
Pattern(s): 1	
note as i experienced the last point is correct in spinner not in autocompletetextview
because autocompletetextview is an edittext itself



26571872
initializer class-method
Pattern(s): 3	
i don t think your initializer method is quite right but without seeing the workflow docs i can t tell you more
however the general pattern to augment backbone components is to extend the model definition s prototype with another class-method not extending the class instance this in your initializer method with a new instance



26580559
nuspec csproj
Pattern(s): 3	
the nuspec is picked up automatically when given the same name as the csproj file
when using token replacement make sure your are trying to nuget pack the csproj file not the nuspec file



26613016
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
this is obviously completely different from floating-points since integer types cannot represent inf or nan
unsigned integers use modular arithmetic so values wrap-around if the result exceeds the largest integer



26666674
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
chars is an unsigned integral type so chars are added together in the same way as all int - numerically
when an addition happens you end up with an int not a chars so calling println on it produces a numeric result



26684032
short base
Pattern(s): 5	
short answer not possible
deprecated tags are used by the android source inside comments as it can be seen in fw base core res values attrs.xml see line 3427 for autotext as referred to in the original post in fw base core res values public.xml and in other places throughout the project but it appears that the build tools used for building applications simply skip all comments meaning the annotiation tags get skipped as well in the process making this method fail



26696128
treemap treeset
Pattern(s): 5	
i am using the reverse mapping as this enables you to just sort all the keys and then map the first two elements of the sorted list to the names in the treemap given a runtime the treemap above will tell you the name of the runner for that time
treemaps are already ordered but since they keys in the map are in a treeset we cannot use index on it to get the two first elements



26697992
ubuntu centos
Pattern(s): 5	
the init.d script provided for ubuntu does not help me much
yes i have successfully installed opencpu server on a centos 6 using jeroen s instructions and have the same question



26726875
mongodb bson
Pattern(s): 5	
mongodb doesn t use json in the first place
it uses bson which is kinda similar to json from the outside but supports more types and more importantly is binary not text



26729158
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 5	
dictionary is an abstract class in java whereas map is an interface
since java does not support multiple inheritances if a class extends dictionary it cannot extend any other class



26730671
folder dir
Pattern(s): 5	
if the dir command generates data the folder is not empty the set p will read information from the pipe and errorlevel will not be set
but if the folder being processed is empty the dir will generate no output the set will fail to retrieve data errorlevel will be set and the rd command will be executed



26736598
jar manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 5	
yes gagravarr i discovered that the jar command doesn t use the -classpath argument although you don t get an error if you include it in the command line
more importantly the class-path section of the manifest.mf file uses a space to separate the items instead of the semi-colon



26770211
xfs btrfs
Pattern(s): 5	
if you do not have such needs xfs may be overkill
btrfs is not stable



26780220
arp udp
Pattern(s): 5	
once the kernel not your socket receives the arp reply it will know the targets mac address and can thus encapsulate your ip packet udp is based on ip into a frame for the local physical network with the local and target mac included and send it out through the network card
arp is not a udp based protocol and thus cannot be captured with an udp socket



26790153
vsto add-in
Pattern(s): 1	
vsto is not designed to support udfs if you really need to have udfs for excel written in c# or .net generally you have some solutions to choose from includes but not limited to
automation com add-in here is a good article about this



26819699
uiview subviews
Pattern(s): 1	
the calayer and its sublayers if any is a representation of a uiview but not its subviews
each subviews has its own calayer



26853168
runtimeexception unchecked-exception
Pattern(s): 5	
subclasses of exception other than runtimeexception will not
exception has subclasses that are unchecked-exception runtimeexception extends exception



26860045
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 3	
maven doesn t yet know where the pom.xml file of the parent is
it has to use the block to figure out where the pom.xml file is only then can it read the contents of the file



26878163
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
because it requires passing of c callback function and swift does not support it currently xcode 6.1.1
then i had to fallback to objective-c and wrap it again



26891310
strlen fgetc
Pattern(s): 5	
a close approximate would be note the added but alone that does not solve handing excessive long lines reading multiple empty lines embedded 0 detection loss of ability to report length read strlen does not work due to embedded 0 and its leaving the trailing n in stdin
short of using with lots of surrounding code which is silly just use fgetc i see no way to use a single scanf absolutely safely when reading a line of user input



26893876
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
instead tablo should be an array of int not chars and instead of using c for scanf and printf you should use d
you re only scanning for single chars not actual numbers



26899062
disk ram
Pattern(s): 1	
but hard disk are not volatile so they can store your files for ever until you delete
ram is a volatile storage device that is it cannot hold files after the pc has shutdown



26902428
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp does not care and will deliver the packets in this order to the application
in tcp data have a sequence number so the receivers operating system will detect reordering and forward the data to the application in the correct order



26948540
vmware virtualbox
Pattern(s): 2	
i really miss this feature on virtualbox because i find vmware to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than virtualbox does
as far as i know virtualbox does not support it but vmware does even in their free vmware



26955647
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome did not display the html-document generated with xml data
firefox and safari however did the job



26965164
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
you have two private_method methods one in the superclass that is private and an overriden one in the subclassing that is public
your code works because the self.private_method in the superclass isn t calling its own private private_method but the one that is public in the subclassing



26988312
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
note udp doesn t really have a concept of connect just sending and receiving packets
if making a tcp connection is analogous to making telephone call then sending a udp packet is more like mailing a letter



26993592
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the query providing the rows for your for-loop is executed once before the first iteration of loops
you would have to call the function getbalanceline in loops not in the base query



27010145
junit testng
Pattern(s): 5	
the junit complies the code and we can even have data pushed into the actual database and rolled back after testing
the testng does not provide this facility



27018834
oncreate onstart
Pattern(s): 5	
oncreate is run whenever an activity is first created followed by onstart followed by onresume
as you can see when a user returns to an activity oncreate is not run again



27025593
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 2	
also when your first if condition is met you can use an enhanced for-loop to iterate over your enemylist if enemylist isn t being modified
in case you want an explanation you are calling the .next method on your downwarditerator object and your while loops isn t checking the right iterator object to see if there are any elements left



27025683
bellman-ford dijkstra
Pattern(s): 3	
that makes your worst-case performance worse than bellman-ford which is therefore preferred for graphs with negative edges
this doesn t mean that your modified dijkstra isn t useful



27102896
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 2	
now with 3 bytes of memory you can use strcpy to copy the string properly
strncpy will not add the terminating null itself in case the n is equal to the size of supplied buffer thus becoming very very unreliable unlike strcpy



27136346
openssl libcrypto
Pattern(s): 1	
openssl libssl has numerous references to libcrypto
if you link -lcrypto first those references haven t been seen so the libcrypto files aren t linked



27150170
tcpdf fpdi
Pattern(s): 5	
so when i use fpdi the type of the fpdi object instantiate is tcpdf and not fpdf
and fpdi called a function of tcpdf which appears on the v6 of tcpdf



27203539
scheme racket
Pattern(s): 1	
scheme isn t following a scheme standard at all but is the legacy name of a language that was r5rs compatible once but has changed it s name to #
racket and has immutable pairs as standard



27214727
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
a the svn folder was not readable by apache user
b possibly the directory was not setup correctly



27250054
addslashes htmlspecialchars
Pattern(s): 1	
addslashes is irrelevant to xss and there is almost always something better in places where it is actually useful
htmlspecialchars is not an unsafe approach



27277070
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome did well and was the most responsive
firefox did not as well as google-chrome high memory consumption but worked



27306941
gruntjs yeoman
Pattern(s): 3	
whereas yeoman is run at the start of the project and never run again generally gruntjs is run continuously while you develop
the big difference here is that yeoman s generators and grunts tasks barely touch each other yeoman isn t built for gruntjs and vice versa



27315641
post put
Pattern(s): 3	
the idea behind http verbs like put get post delete are just a matter of protocol semantics
just performing an http put operation doesn t do anything magical



27330169
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
since your to is 1 of type int you get overload version 4 with a return type of double
now it s entirely possible that given a float f float nextafter double f 1 is exactly equal to the original f it s rather likely that the next representable number in type double cannot be represented in float and that the conversion back to float rounds down



27364280
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
in this case the minimum width is not set for the four images
hence as the gridlayout structure changes according to the pressed button the constraints are recalculated and in certain patterns the recalculated widths height gives more space to the first images according to the flow



27391741
webclient webrequest
Pattern(s): 2	
first of all you cannot do it with webclient it doesn t maintain cookies between redirects
the ugly way is to use webrequest to send a request then check responseuri to determine if you was redirected to authentication page



27392872
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
your last for-loop has a bad test condition
should be using countfile not count and less than size otherwise your loops body isn t entered



27405441
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
use layout and layout-land folder not values and values-land
in those directory put separate versions of your my_layout.xml



27423310
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
similarly int arrays don t per se have any kind of terminator
an array of chars does not end with a 0-terminator unless it contains a data-structure having such a terminator like a c-string or by coincidence



27511742
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want the user to only make one choice from several options use radio button not checkbox
users have certain expectations when it comes to the interface and using checkbox would be counter-intuitive



27520313
udp rtp
Pattern(s): 5	
so i think what s happening is that something in your network is dropping udp packets that rtp is telling the audiostream which data is missing and the result is gaps because there s no error correction or data redundancy in the pcm_u8 data stream to allow the lost data to be reconstructed by the audiostream
i ve seen things like vmware deliberately drop udp packets on a virtual network as a way of ensuring good performance the justification being that udp is not guaranteed delivery anyway so it doesn t matter



27563283
addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 5	
mathematical side note the num class generally models algebraic structures called rings which have a commutative addition and a not necessarily commutative multiplication which satisfy some compatibility rules
in this case the addition is not commutative so it cannot be a ring



27569272
downcasting upcasting
Pattern(s): 5	
java only allows implicit upcasting not implicit downcasting
upcasting in java is also called widening conversion and downcasting is called narrowing conversion



27573467
hive hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
however hadoop based data warehouse hive does not support updates and does not support all the sql statements
hence it is better to read those files from hdfs apply filters transformation and load the result to traditional data warehouse appliance such as netezza to write your queries for cubes



27613709
interpreted-language compiled-language
Pattern(s): 1	
an interpreted-language must do this same translation at the same time it s trying to run the program
that typically slows it down though modern interpreters and virtual machines like to brag about how they can do a few things faster because they have the extra information that a compiled-language doesn t



27652808
decltype auto
Pattern(s): 3	
note decltype auto is primarily useful for deducing the return type of forwarding functions and similar wrappers as shown above where you want the type to exactly track some expression you re invoking
however decltype auto is not intended to be a widely used feature beyond that



27667591
salt md5
Pattern(s): 5	
firstly hashing password without salt will defer the security
secondly md5 is not considered secure any more so usage in new application is not recommended



27673808
lxml beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 5	
aside from that improvement lxml would do the job faster
beautifulsoup cannot give you just a count number of tags it found



27675068
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
there is a third scenario in which a method of the subclassing has the same signature as a method of the superclass but the method of the superclass is not accessible to the subclassing it s either private or package-private and the superclass is in a different package
in this case the method of the subclassing is not overriding the method of the superclass



27683446
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
a regular for-loop wouldn t work so you would need t use a for in loops
objects also don t return a length property that is accurate enough to iterate over the entire object so a for in loops is absolutely necessary



27695354
haskell agda
Pattern(s): 5	
now i believe this approach is a fair bit more practical than indexing with monoids because haskell doesn t have kind classes or first-class type level functions that would make the monoid approach palatable
it would be nice to have a verifiedmonoid class like in idris or agda which includes correctness proofs besides the usual methods



27720766
wildfly jboss
Pattern(s): 5	
the kitchensink sample can be deployed via mvn wildfly deploy not mvn jboss-as deploy
make sure you don t mix wildfly with jboss and don t start the sample twice from eclipse and from maven



27725774
pull push
Pattern(s): 3	
the opposite of push is not really pull it s fetch
in particular git pull is essentially git fetch plus an extra step git merge or git rebase



27747395
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
note that pow here takes an int not another bigdecimal
the double type in java is a ieee double and has only 53 bits of precision



27804585
getter setter
Pattern(s): 3	
in c++ cli a trivial property is one where the getter setter is not declared
with a non-trivial property the getter setter are declared explicitly with syntax that s more like a normal method declaration than c# s property syntax



27823949
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
the answer bigdestroyer gives this error the method parseint string in the type int is not applicable for the arguments chars
you can just do it with chars and not with integers at all



27852394
elasticsearch kibana
Pattern(s): 5	
you can certainly query elasticsearch manually if you want but you can get a whole lot more by using marvel to check the overall health and availability of your elasticsearch cluster including disk space
kibana doesn t really use hard disk space itself that s reported by elasticsearch



27864167
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
in order to compare it with another password you should compare the hash not the real passwords
the easy way to make hash with salt would be using messagedigest



27864983
robocopy xcopy
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to combine it into the robocopy command do something like this
and as magoo points out xcopy probably isn t going to go away any time soon



27868413
nsurl nsdata
Pattern(s): 1	
if as you seem to be insisting the url is fine and you ve confirmed the nsurl is not nil but the nsdata is still coming up nil then you should use a different retrieval mechanism one that returns an nserror explaining why it failed
for example you could replace this dispatch_async to he background with a call to sendasynchronousrequest and if the nsdata was nil then look at the nserror object



27869157
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
really it s just that the other verbs are idempotent no side effects and that performing a duplicate request should produce a duplicate result therefore post is the only verb that could satisfy those needs but in general post is a catch-all for anything the other verbs don t do well
post can legitimately be used as a retrieval more resulting in redirection or processing verb when the limitations of get cannot otherwise be worked around



27875674
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 1	
it may be simpler just to configure sudo such that a passwd is not needed
i assume your username is user1 and you wish that user1 may run sudo find -name vlc.png without a passwd



27920539
uitabbaritem uibaritem
Pattern(s): 5	
uitabbaritem is not a subclass of uiview
it s a subclass of uibaritem which inherited from nsobject



27987355
strlen strncpy
Pattern(s): 1	
your loop is safe because it is based on strlen not the number of substr you computed
strncpy does not null terminate strings



28010641
int double
Pattern(s): 2	
there s also no guarantee how floating point types will be represented so it would be a blind shot to assume that converting int to double or even long double for comparison will solve anything
even double may not be able to represent all int values depending on how much bits does int contain



28014940
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
the fact that you can input integer data doesn t change that - the data is converted to floating-point on the fly
the normalized parameter controls how the conversion is done if it is enabled the range of the input type is mapped to the normalized 0 1 for unsigned types also called unorm ing the gl or -1 1 for signed types also called snorm if it is disabled the value is directly converted to the nearest floating-point value of the input integer



28043250
profiler yourkit
Pattern(s): 5	
the threads which actually do these calls are filtered from the threads view within the profiler and cannot be seen
that s why the stack-trace-view of yourkit itself is no help analyzing that problem



28076784
mp4 h.264
Pattern(s): 1	
yes h.264 is not royalty free but wrapping it an an mp4 does not remove that restriction
.264 is just h.264 nauls saved in annexb format



28092489
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
the point is that safari has a functionality google-chrome doesn t when safari auto-completes the request it sends the request

cashapelayer uibezierpath
Pattern(s): 5	
cashapelayer doesn t make any attempt to tell if the point intersects the shape layer s path
uibezierpath does have a hittest method but i m pretty sure that detects touches in the interior of a closed path and would not work with a thick line arc line the one you re using



28108946
metaspace permgen
Pattern(s): 1	
detaching metadata from permgen not only allows the seamless management of metaspace but also allows for improvements such as simplification of full garbage collections and future concurrent de-allocation of class metadata
the move to metaspace was necessary since the permgen was really hard to tune

fgets fread
Pattern(s): 1	
you cannot use fgets to read binary files because the fgets interface doesn t tell you how much it read
you can use the posix 2008 getline interface instead or you can do binary input with fread which is more efficient but will force you to count newlines yourself



28213014
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	
as you can see the hash is effectively an md5 hash of the email address
md5 hashes cannot be decrypted

28339931
sse avx2
Pattern(s): 3	
currently compiling using the 128 bit sse instructions this is faster than all s but using the 256 bit avx2 setting was slower even with all s
however if you set up your program to test lots of points in an array you can get it to fully vectorize and the a dramatic performance improvement still with sse not avx or avx2



28354407
defineproperty setter
Pattern(s): 1	
if the defineproperty is described with a writable value descriptor it works just fine

children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
since the draw method causes a fractal ellipse to either draw or fill itself the parent doesn t need to call context.draw or context.fill on the children
instead if you call the children s draw method recursively they will call context.draw or context.fill on themselves



28951414
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 1	
actually it s not logical if you have a really done a successful major upgrade and b those dlls were only in the older versioning and not in the newer upgrade you installed then they should not be there at all
the old product is no longer there if the upgrade was successful and there is no old versioning to have those files - it s uninstalled by the upgrade

29262873
crossover mutation
Pattern(s): 5	
a common mistake is to encode everything as a bitvector and then in crossover to split the bitvector at random places splitting up the good thing the bitvector represented and thereby destroying the thing that made the individual float to the top as a good candidate
a vector of limited integers is likely to be a better choice where integers can be replaced by mutation but not by crossover



29263171
persistent transient
Pattern(s): 5	
if the persistent context participates in a transaction the in-memory state of the managed entities will get synchronized to the database
a detached transient entity cannot be used with any entitymanager operation that requires a managed instance

it seems to be a dex build error



29459653
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
the salt isn t a secret it s just a custom thing you add to avoid having the hash cracked with precomputed lookup tables like rainbow tables
the salt is usually stored with the hash either in the same database in a different field or when using php s password_hash it s actually just concatenated to the hash looking something like mysalt.hash



29460445
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 5	
uilabel is a view uitextview is a view too the method boundingrectwithsize is not the same thing as a view frame is just the bounding rect to contain that text
as suggested by aaron uitextview contains padding while uilabel not



29475970
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
starting with ios 11 you should only store user visible documents in the documents folder see wwdc 2017 fall video ios storage best practices
even if you had internally used files that were not easily reconstructed unless the intent was to eventually expose the user to them you d use the application support directory not the documents folder



29482854
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
your children elements being position absolute
are removed from the natural document flow and the main_container parent cannot contain them properly



29568381
for-loop loops

29606081
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 5	
quicksort cannot be used on lists
for lists mergesort is the way to go as long as the list contains more than one element split it into two lists sort each of them then merge the two sorted lists into one since both lists are sorted only the heads have to be compared



29642341
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 5	
iirc you get nil if the accessor is not set explicitly setter getter so you have to take the properties name following the naming conventions
with a setter it is a bit more complicated because you have to prefix the properties s name with set and make the first character of the name uppercased



29699341
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
however note that optional methods do not exist in pure swift they are there only because objective-c have them so there is no big reason for swift to have special grammar for optional methods
also note that even objective-c doesn t have a special grammar for checking of existence of optional methods



29701405
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
when iterating using a for-loop python doesn t automatically make a copy of the list but iterates on it directly
so when you remove an element loops won t take the change into account and will skip elements of the list



29744764
std ostream
Pattern(s): 5	
it s complaining that str is missing in aka std ostream not std ostringstream
std ostringstream s still returns it inherits these operators from std ostream which has no str member

the reason i think the problem has to do with the css folder is that only this folder seems to be unavailable
if you try visiting a 403 forbidden error is shown directory listing not allowed



29864075
defineproperty setter
Pattern(s): 5	
defineproperty does not consider inherited properties and their descriptors
if the existing possibly inherited properties is an accessor the assignment will try to call the setter and fail if none exists while definepropery will overwrite the properties with the data descriptor or fail if it is an own non-configurable one



29865957
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
also with the for-loop it s considered better to limit the scope of the iterating variable i and to use println you need system.out not just system and you need a string java arrays do not override tostring so something to output the numbers the user entered after loops like
your for-loop syntax is a little off and you should print your arrays after you read in all of the user s values



29904392
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
here is a guide to check for this feature using coreinfo how to check if your cpu supports second level address translation
if your processors doesn t get a new processors pc



29904689
do.call lapply
Pattern(s): 5	
- lapply is similar to map do.call is not
lapply applies a function to all elements of a list do.call calls a function where all the function arguments are in a list



29910036
strcpy malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
strcpy does not allow for checking the size of the target buffer so a malicious user can execute a buffer overflow attack on your code
the malloc was given strlen bptr + 2



29922290
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
use malloc or calloc to allocate memory realloc to allocate or extend a buffer that s been allocated with malloc calloc or realloc and free to deallocate memory that was allocated with malloc calloc or realloc
malloc does not initialize the dynamically-allocated memory



29923885
bash tcsh
Pattern(s): 5	
i m not sure you can get an exact duplicate of that alias in bash since i don t think bash will do history expansion on an alias expansion so the closest you can get is a function that takes files as arguments
that example is a tcsh alias not a bash alias



29938056
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
will not work because a superclass can not assigned to a sub class variable
the general problem is that the subclassing is more specific than the superclass



29948715
mp4 h.264
Pattern(s): 5	
mp4 is not really a format but a container that can hold video in different formats
firefox supports only h.264 encoded video



29956814
width margin
Pattern(s): 5	
also note that when a margin is specified in terms of percentage the margin s value is computed as a percentage of the width of the container
even for the vertical margins the percentage is applied on the width and not the height of the container



30008278
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 3	
properties and synthesized accessor were added later to automatically implement patterns that had been long established at that point
properties are not always backed by an ivar



30041566
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
this will chmod all files in your html folder which is not recommended for production for security reasons but should let you see the files in that folder to be sure that isn t the issue while troubleshooting
in my case it was because the permissions on the root web directory were not set correctly



30149018
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
i would recommend always specifying the start point in a for-loop and also calculate string length only once not each loops
a major problem is your second loops does not run



30185086
toolbar tabs
Pattern(s): 3	
in fact the tabs are not in the toolbar
the toolbar is just hidden



30205743
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
i think the default constructor is only necessary for deserialization never used a package for deserialization
serializable shouldn t need it



30205743
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
serializable shouldn t need it
the default constructor is redundant because if the deserialization package needs a default constructor it obviously attempts to create an instance using the default constructor to afterwards set the field values which can t work with final fields



30206842
uiviewcontroller uipopovercontroller
Pattern(s): 3	
uipopovercontroller doesn t have any content of it s own it needs another uiviewcontroller that renders the stuff you actually want to present
any subclass of uiviewcontroller would suffice as long as it doesn t conflict with the popover controller



30227242
hash-collision key
Pattern(s): 5	
the trick is to use objects instead of strings as key and to override the hash comparison see how hash-collision are resolved in python dictionaries
the comments below debate the technical aspects of whether these are duplicate key or not but this is a side issue



30241011
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
this is a for-loop over a very fast operation adding two numbers and the overhead of loops will be significant compared to the vectorized sum function which adds up all the elements in the vector
the sum function is quick because it s implemented in c so it will be more efficient to do than to use the for-loop not to mention less typing



30241986
project.json csproj
Pattern(s): 1	
project.json is not a configuration file
it is the project metadata just like csproj is for c# projects



30283080
elasticsearch kibana
Pattern(s): 3	
what you are seeing is not a parsing error shardfailures just means that the underlying elasticsearch is not ready yet
when starting kibana elasticsearch make sure your es cluster is ready before diving into kibana run curl -xget localhost 9200 _cluster health and in the response you should see something similar to this

google-chrome does not implement this yet but firefox does
the following is a complete webrtc call that works in firefox note uses arrow functions



30348035
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the variable c should be an int not a chars
otherwise c might never compare equal to eof because eof is not necessarily in the range of chars that s why fgetc returns int



30348580
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
note that with swift this is no longer possible and will result in a compiler error instead
objective-c is not as type-safe as other languages and does not care whether the delegate explicitly declares conformance using



30351776
viewdidappear viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 1	
you should either use viewdidappear or add a slight delay before displaying the alert controller
viewwillappear is not a good location to present another view controller since the current one being presented is not yet in the window hierarchy and is also in a transition animation



30406504
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 3	
actually the situation is a bit dire since neither strcpy nor strncpy are absolutely good functions
by itself strcpy isn t safe since you can t control the output buffer size and strncpy is inefficient since it writes more zeros than what may be desired



30417929
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
according to the above mario s post postgresql does not allow using the same connection for more than one thread
i am wondering if the mysql is the same plus mysql may put lock while accessing it



30424677
abstract-class superclass
Pattern(s): 5	
abstract-class cannot be instantiated directly - they must be subclassed by a non-abstract class and that subclass can be instantiated
but when you instantiate a subclass all the fields of the superclass are also part of the object that you created



30514521
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
f int is visible within the definition context but not f double so overload resolution resolves to f int for both calls
f double cannot be found by adl because built-in types have no associated classes or namespaces



30543429
np-hard np-complete
Pattern(s): 3	
unfortunately there is little hope to find an algorithm which is much better than brute-force considering that the problem is actually np-hard but not even np-complete
a proof of np-hardness of this problem is that the minimum vertex cover problem well known to be np-hard and not np-complete is easily reducible to it



30559071
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
however normal for-loop does not use iterator so that is reason you are not getting exception in that loops but there be other side effects of modifying in for-loop like size getting changed or iteration becoming infinite
only reason you are getting this exception is that your collection is getting modified in loops iteration i think move method is modifying object which will get reflected in list



30584727
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
because the double is represented in a totally different format from the int even if you assume they have the same sizes
a double uses a floating point format whereas the int does not



30651392
addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 5	
in addition as mentioned by ratchet-freak in comments you should make sure your quaternions are always normalized otherwise transformations other than rotation may happen
quaternion multiplication is not commutative if a and b are quaternions then



30675687
seaborn matplotlib
Pattern(s): 5	
seaborn does not change the behavior of matplotlib functions in the way you describe
matplotlib exposes a number of options for customization that take effect by changing the default values of various plot parameters



30682089
lxml beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 1	
for xml documents it may be that the elementtree offered by lxml is more productive
it supports xpath queries for example while beautifulsoup does not



30682089
elementtree beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 5	
for xml documents it may be that the elementtree offered by lxml is more productive
it supports xpath queries for example while beautifulsoup does not



30688200
httpresponse request
Pattern(s): 1	
you may want to log the value of httpresponse to find the exact error from stripe
looking at your code the error is most likely invalid request error cannot use token tok_3tnivhev9p24t0 more than once



30689072
objectoutputstream objectinputstream
Pattern(s): 2	
you re using an objectoutputstream to write the object s from the client
you should be using an objectinputstream not a datainputstream to read them on the server



30693775
pdcurses ncurses
Pattern(s): 1	
noting comments pdcurses is not a port but a separate program
ncurses has a workable port to windows for what it s worth



30708009
oncreate onnewintent
Pattern(s): 5	
for singletop activities the onnewintent method acts as an entry point which is executed instead of oncreate
because the activity already exists somewhere oncreate is not called



30719258
referenceequals gethashcode
Pattern(s): 5	
test for equality call the referenceequals or equals method
gethashcode does not return cryptographic hash



30755932
tinyint boolean
Pattern(s): 1	
tinyint 1 value inside tinyint is necessary
for mysql use the type boolean not null type



30764927
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 2	
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically
links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this



30787746
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 1	
you need to know that firefox is not scriptable at all
however safari partially is scriptable



30807204
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
i m assuming you mean the for-loop and not the other stuff
for loops are basically while except more organized



30814452
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 2	
your for-loop doesn t actually iterate over those files
thus i ve changed loops to use a foreach iteration since you already have an arrays containing the files that you care about



30824969
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
if you care about performance more than using eloquent then with raw queries in postgresql with returning clause or sql server with output clause you can return updated records in one go
mysql unfortunately doesn t have such support on a statement level



30851323
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
i don t think that s what you re going for though in which case a for-loop is probably best
but for loops aren t too costly in matlab



30853224
neo4j arangodb
Pattern(s): 1	
furthermore neo4j is not distributed
neo4j is written in java arangodb is written in c++ and embeds google s v8 to execute javascript extensions



30873728
namenode hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
namenode keeps the information about files and their associated blocks
hdfs will not move blocks from old datanodes to new datanodes to balance the cluster if a datanode added in hadoop cluster.to do this you need to run the balancer



30896153
mongodb bson
Pattern(s): 5	
but from the source code here or here for example it appears that mongodb bson s implementation use strcmp to perform binary comparison on element names confirming there is no way to achieve what you want
this might be indeed an issue beyond case sensitivity as using combining characters the same character might have several binary representations -- but mongodb does not perform unicode normalization



30911294
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome will show warnings long before that but still accept them
firefox will not accept sha-1 after january 2017



30914642
namenode hdfs
Pattern(s): 3	
in this case you may check if the namenode is started correctly on the master by checking logs at your yourhadoopfolder logs hadoop- hadoop-user -namenode-master.log
it is often caused by the hdfs is not formatted before



30915238
min max
Pattern(s): 1	
so std min is not a 1-1 substitute for fmin
the functions std min and std max are not commutative



30921563
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 5	
uilabel doesn t support selecting and copy
uilabel is derived from uiview but uitextview is derived from uiscrollview



30927456
performselector delegation
Pattern(s): 5	
one of the big problems is that performselector doesn t exist in swift so you should call the specific function directly
and to do this and conform to swifts type safety you ll need to ensure your delegation is the class with the isparsereachable function on it



30936740
free memcpy
Pattern(s): 2	
if you found your particular case you gain 2x speed and you think you need to speed it up you are free to get your hand dirty with clear comments
memcpy is not the same as



30938397
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
you can set your image view constrains as follows - its width should be equal to your super view width centerx and centery are the same as super s
and height not an equal constraint but lessthanorequal to super s height



30968855
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
the method should return a double not an int
when you do 1 a and you do not explicitly cast it to float double the default result will be an int this is the default type of a arithmetic operation in java between integral operands if not explicitly cast to something else



30981588
qbytearray qchar
Pattern(s): 5	
we ll need to see a minimal example that reproduces the problem and only then can one decide whether qbytearray itself is the culprit or more likely the incorrect way that you ve designed your solution
qchar is not char



30999205
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to use a external database i would recommend you to import the shape file in postgresql and not in mysql since it has a more powerful support for spatial data
mysql supports several geometry functions for editing and querying spatial data



31016042
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
getchar returns int not chars
whether chars is signed or unsigned is not fixed by the standard but implementation dependend



31037337
nfa dfa
Pattern(s): 1	
if it finds a match then it goes back and matches the full regex using an nfa engine i think traditional non-posix but starting at the location where the simplified match occurred
this is much faster for both non-matches and matches than a straight nfa engine but still lets you use all the things in an nfa that a dfa does not support



31039303
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
equatable is a swift protocol not available in objective-c which requires that there is a operator defined for the type
in objective-c there is no operator overloading



31097602
ubuntu debian
Pattern(s): 3	
the packages provided by ubuntu debian do not automatically install all dependencies required for every module so i had to hunt down a solution between stackexchange google and the developers website
what fixed this for me note on debian not centos was installing the following packages



31102214
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
the specific swift file showing the code required to interact with an nscollectionview is imagelistcontroller.swift
if you want to learn more about the new nscollectionview there s a whole wwdc session and the video is available from apple but the presenter uses objective-c not swift



31129523
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
if the chunked response does not end properly google-chrome cannot read it
but firefox and safari are taking care of this internally



31163116
getter hasownproperty
Pattern(s): 5	
es6 __proto__ is a getter defined on object.prototype
for an object that doesn t have that in its prototype chain it is not accessible just like say hasownproperty isn t



31168935
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
between the two i think postgresql is more suitable for a central data warehouse
mysql doesn t allow certain sql methods such as common table expressions and window functions



31172218
stdout fflush
Pattern(s): 3	
so when you tell the program to fflush stdout you re really just telling it to take what s in stdout and make sure it s all displayed on the screen.
in computer science the term fflush doesn t mean to erase what s already in a buffer



31193820
uninstall upgrade
Pattern(s): 1	
note that the uninstall does not try to stop the service so reboots may be required to completely uninstall the service
upgrading services with a removepreviousversions upgrade is really difficult since they changed the upgrade behavior in vs 2008



31211925
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 5	
note also according to man 5 crontab you can set a mailto variable in your crontab file which will direct output errors from your jobs to an email address
beware that the path used by cron may not include usr local bin where python is installed



31219726
bower npm
Pattern(s): 1	
the problem is that bower offers no specialized tooling for the purpose
it offers no tooling that i know of that npm doesn t and especially none that is specifically useful for front-end developers



31223414
multiplication modulo
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to mimic the original ideal of multiplying by a prime the obvious generalization is to do arithmetic in the galois field gf 2 8 - see and note that you can essentially use log and antilog tables of size 256 to replace multiplication with not much more than table lookup -
arithmetic over a finite field of any sort will have many of the nice properties of arithmetic modulo a prime - arithmetic modulo p is gp p or gf p 1 if you prefer



31227943
multiplication exponent
Pattern(s): 5	
note that remainder is taken after every multiplication so no overflow can occur if single multiplication doesn t overflow and that s true for 1000000007 as m and long long
as already mentioned your problem is that for large exponent you have integer overflow



31233819
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
my core-list did work in firefox and not in google-chrome
i noticed that google-chrome gave me an error that no height was set even though i set height to 100



31287845
boost allocator
Pattern(s): 2	
the problem is that clearly boost icl doesn t currently support stateful allocator
this means that not all constructors take an allocator instance to pass in the required state



31328319
rowdatabound onclientclick
Pattern(s): 3	
this is likely due to rowdatabound not being called again on postback
if you inspect the gridview via browser developer tools before and after you do the initial select i expect that initially the onclientclick event is properly set and disappears after the first select



31331192
uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
as you have correctly done the uitabbarcontroller should not push a uiviewcontroller but a uinavigationcontroller
that uinavigationcontroller should have a rootviewcontroller



31337995
setinterval clearinterval
Pattern(s): 5	
the return value of setinterval is an int which is the id of the interval you created
when you call clearinterval it doesn t unset the variable that stores this integer id



31338741
chart.js angular-chart
Pattern(s): 1	
note that the request for chart.js doesn t go to the path that you expect
this seems like a bug with angular-chart - see a similar issue for typeahead.js -



31365356
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
tcp is connection oriented whereas udp is not
udp uses packets whereas tcp is a byte streaming protocol



31365356
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp uses packets whereas tcp is a byte streaming protocol
tcp is reliable whereas udp is not



31376551
symfony silex
Pattern(s): 5	
if you insist on going the yaml route you shouldn t if you need frameworkbundle you should use symfony instead of silex you can always create your own redirectcontroller with a urlredirectmethod be aware that resolving controller arguments won t work directly this is one of the reasons i suggest you to use symfony and don t reivent the wheel
afaik silex does not have such an option but you can just return a redirect response from your route without yaml



31387201
lisp racket
Pattern(s): 5	
unlike clojure or emacs lisp racket doesn t have doc strings in the function definition source
racket docs don t have a convention like the one that the first line of a doc string should be a summary a short-version to use in situations like a list of commands or in a repl



31432342
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
however the width is not enough so the imageview auto resize the image to fit for it s width
and that s why their height is still there and display as free space as you mention



31441301
realloc strdup
Pattern(s): 2	
if you are going to have too many entries than you can use realloc to increase the size of the list inside the loop
if strdup is not available it can be easily implemented by using malloc and strlen functions



31459131
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
subclassing do not inherited their superclass initializers by default
however superclass initializers are automatically inherited if



31507028
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
suppose that int is 64 bits and double is an ieee double
then there are int not representable as double such as 2 53 +1 making the proposition false



31535813
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
but udp is not reliable the packet might get lost
tcp is reliable is connection oriented but is more complex



31538804
cpython pypy
Pattern(s): 3	
the documentation at is misleading the beta versions of vmprof on os x or freebsd are only available for cpython not for pypy
vmprof on pypy is only enabled on 64-bit linux right now



31562686
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
using an int to represent the address of a double stored somewhere and attempting to cast an int to a is undefined behaviour in c++
an int might not even be large enough to hold a pointer address



31624397
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
superclass deinitializers are inherited by their subclassing and the superclass deinitializer is called automatically at the end of a subclassing deinitializer implementation
superclass deinitializers are always called even if a subclassing does not provide its own deinitializer



31628496
kramdown redcarpet
Pattern(s): 1	
redcloth does support a wealth of configuration options though which kramdown does not
redcarpet is the ruby community s usual go-to choice for implementing markdown though there are other options kramdown for example



31642419
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 2	
correct the interval for setinterval cannot be changed once it is started
you ll need to use settimeout to make the interval different each time



31652667
unsigned short
Pattern(s): 1	
what happens now is quite subtle acknowledge pascalcuoq beacuse all values of unsigned short are representable in int a + b will be computed as an int
only if short and int are the same width or in some other way some values of unsigned short cannot be represented as int will the sum will be computed as unsigned int .



31668202
scheme racket
Pattern(s): 5	
edit under linux the installer for petite chez scheme does not include swl you have to download it directly
racket is kind of an extended scheme but you can also choose to use standard scheme by specifying



31677521
hive oozie
Pattern(s): 1	
you could have a single oozie workflow which launches some custom process a shell action and within that process read the data from hive and launch a new separate oozie workflow for each entry
oozie does not support loops cycles since it is a directed acyclic graph



31682396
uiviewcontroller uinavigationcontroller
Pattern(s): 1	
2 rootviewcontroller is defined as a uiviewcontroller - not the uinavigationcontroller subclass
we need to cast it to a uinavigationcontroller to be able to operate on it as one



31682476
mayavi matplotlib
Pattern(s): 3	
note that unlike matplotlib mayavi is not yet compatible with python3 and might not be in the foreseeable future so you ll need a python2 installation
matplotlib is not quite mature for 3d graphics



31684469
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to repeatedly call a function you need setinterval not settimeout
settimeout invokes its callback once after a delay



31700858
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
i noticed the plugin had a setter but not a getter equivalent for the value of the editor
this is odd because the normal jquery pattern for plugins that create content with a value is to have the getter be an overloaded paramater-less version of the setter



31711854
momentjs datejs
Pattern(s): 5	
momentjs does not currently have the functionality to interpret a string like that
datejs hasn t been updated in 8 years



31749596
sidekiq actionmailer
Pattern(s): 5	
as i want to send emails in background using sidekiq i should not forget to start sidekiq mailers queue in my procfile
i can send delayed notifications using directly actionmailer or using activejob



31757842
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
most popular video formats are 4 3 or 16 9 so the width is larger then the height
therefore in order to preserve the ratio naturally the height will not be fully filled



31758001
console.readline console.writeline
Pattern(s): 2	
console.readline does not take any arguments
its only purpose is to read the console so you should use console.writeline to ask your questions like enter a number



31759476
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
if it is false the body of loops does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the for-loop
after the body of the for-loop executes the flow of control jumps back up to the increment statement



31790346
jtextfield jtextpane
Pattern(s): 5	
a jtextfield invokes an actionlistener when the enter key is pressed
a jtextpane doesn t support this functionality the default is to insert a new line so you will need to replicate this functionality for the jtextpane



31792893
build.gradle gradlew
Pattern(s): 3	
error cannot find symbol class means your build.gradle file doesn t contain a reference to the classes that your source code refers to
adding a library to the project structure will only affect the ide you re using and not the actual build script gradlew uses to actually compile your work



31801392
strcpy strdup
Pattern(s): 5	
strcpy doesn t allocate space for your copy - it assumes you ve already done that
strdup allocates memory for you



31809377
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
note keep in mind to clear the setinterval when not required as it may cause abnormal behaviour may slowdown the javascript engine
call setinterval instead of settimeout for recurring callback function execution after definite time interval delay



31830268
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
since the password will be the same and only the salt changes a cracker with access to the hash can brute-force with exactly the same cost
changing the salt will not improve the security a salt is not a secret it fullfills its job even if it is known



31852458
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
for backward compatibility ie still supports this model and google-chrome also has added support for this feature
but firefox is not supporting it



31889871
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 2	
some commands require sudo and so we set that up so that it does not require a passwd to be entered
alternatively you could run the jenkins slave jar after already having sudo -- not recommended



31904213
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
website root folder is a subfolder in your project directory named wwwroot by default but can be changed in project.json
this means that everything outside a website root folder is not accessible to the outside world



31924572
viewdidload viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 5	
you can subscribe to this perhaps in your viewdidload and run your code in the callback
i m not sure why viewwillappear doesn t get called but i have a different solution



31924937
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
the command is trying to run the batch file from the current working directory which isn t necessarily the same folder in which the scripts reside
if you need to run another script from the same folder use the automatic variable to determine the parent folder



31954464
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
you can use for f to validate the character - if the character contains a non digit then the for-loop will fire so loops exits with success so the error processing code after || will not fire
if the character contains only digits then loops does not fire so it exits with error and the error processing code executes



31985034
division modulo
Pattern(s): 3	
so as long you have a perfectly representatble floating point number there is a good possibility that the division modulo will go through smoothly
however when you try to divide or take modulo by 0.1 or 0.2 there is always a roundoff error in its floating point representation which means the division will not be complete and hence the result will not be true



32006614
disk ram
Pattern(s): 5	
if you had swap space configured you d likely start swapping to disk if not and you were running on linux then you may hit the kernel s oom-killer which would start terminating processes to obtain memory - and as it often kills the biggest process you d probably find the couchbase server memcached process being killed
the couchbase server ram quota specified the maximum amount of ram to be used by the data service for caching documents



32040211
clang icc
Pattern(s): 1	
with any optimization level higher than -o0 gcc and clang optimize if n 2 to what we expect
the other huge surprise is that icc 13 doesn t



32040743
preferenceactivity listpreference
Pattern(s): 5	
my first problem was to get back the option user selected from listpreference from preferenceactivity i realized that preferenceactivity automatically saves information to sharedprererences so what i have to do is just retrieve that information in oncreate method and save it in a local variable
second problem was that whenever i open settings activity preferenceactivity the summery of listpreference was not showing last chosen value to solve that problem i just have to set the summery of listpreference in setonpreferencechangelistener method



32046544
dymola openmodelica
Pattern(s): 3	
dymola does this automatically for you
openmodelica does not



32046992
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
tcp not udp is also possible though doesn t guarantee application logic actually processes the notification
however udp is the default for snmp for good reasons as described at this so answer



32070706
free memset
Pattern(s): 1	
using the address of a free block causes undefined behaviour
note that your memset did not even try to write into the free block



32074621
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
it s a general purpose cryptographic hash function not meant for passwords
salt must be unique per user



32104832
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
and within the for-loop to get the first 4 letters in s1 to be in its own string substr add the line
also s1array is a string arrays and not a string



32118736
free realloc
Pattern(s): 1	
and to free a memory not allocated by malloc or similar functions crashes your program
attempting to free an invalid pointer a pointer to a memory block that was not allocated by calloc malloc or realloc may affect subsequent allocation requests and cause errors



32156106
gson jackson
Pattern(s): 5	
gson doesn t care about jackson annotations
if you want these annotations to be taken into account use jackson to deserialize your json



32158137
rtos isr
Pattern(s): 5	
ultimately if there are significantly time critical tasks and event handling to perform then an rtos might be in order
i would imagine that the precision of delay_ms is determined exactly by the stability of your xtal - it is unlikly that that is your problem unless you are running on a low precision rc oscilator and if that is the case using timer hardware or an isr will not help as they all run on the same clock



32164080
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
you can convert each chars digit to int by subtract the value of 0 from it
your problem is that you calculate the sum of chars values not integer values



32199066
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
when you click a button inside a label the label s activation behavior must be to do nothing because the button is an interactive content it means that we should think that user want to activate the button instead of the enclosing label so it won t change the checkbox s state by clicking the button
i think you could use non-interactive content instead of the button not sure if it s good for a11y tho or just unhide the checkbox and use it instead of the button



32239403
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
this way the children are not added until you want them to
what we have done is before adding the parent to the dbset disconnect the child collections from the parent making sure to push the existing collections to other variables to allow working with them later and then replacing the current child collections with new empty collections



32251550
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
if you have a good cpu i5 or i7 then you can go up to five or six hours with your cpu maintaining good performance
if you have a lower end processors i do not recommend allowing it to go at 100 for more than a couple of hours



32287483
sudoers visudo
Pattern(s): 2	
the first problem is that whoever wrote the tutorial is giving bad advice etc sudoers is not supposed to be edited directly
you are supposed to use visudo to edit that file to avoid shooting yourself in the foot



32334651
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 1	
therefore quicksort is not an option
so a variant of mergesort is used the current java versions use timsort



32346710
pull push
Pattern(s): 5	
if my memory serves me correctly then if you force push or update the branch in question in any way github will automatically update the pull request
if doing the force push would result in the pull request not being possible then github will tell you this



32365498
csr pki
Pattern(s): 5	
the csr contains information identifying the applicant ... which must be signed using the applicant s private key
and according to what i know of pki this doesn t make much sense



32424120
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 5	
on apache it runs as a plugin module just the way mod_php does
for nginx i m not sure



32427702
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 2	
using g++ to compile multiple .cpp and .h files in sublime 2
the reason why using .cpp in sublime text fails is gcc does not do



32428738
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
for-loop that generates a list of n random numbers between 0 and maxvalue
your loops doesn t iterate from 0 to n



32431725
single-quotes double-quotes
Pattern(s): 3	
just a quick follow-up on this -- on windows you need to use double-quotes and not single-quotes throughout the command line
single-quotes are just considered part of the value so the above would send client_id instead of client_id



32482739
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
the sys tables sys.check_constraints could change in future versioning and isn t considered a reliable way to access this data
your code might not survive a sql upgrade whereas using a reference table would



32512259
qcolor qmap
Pattern(s): 1	
no because qcolor doesn t provide which is required by qmap s key type
the key type of a qmap must provide specifying a total order



32527821
min max
Pattern(s): 1	
a cumulative min is not needed
the max is the current value for each docmasterid which also happens to be the current value period



32532101
screens tablet
Pattern(s): 5	
in you manifest xxhdpi screens aren t listed in the supported screens as well as xxxhdpi ones
tablet usually are hdpi or even mdpi in density number of pixels per square inch

haskell idris
Pattern(s): 5	
unfortunately haskell doesn t yet have proper support for dependent typing and existing workaround solutions involve some boilerplate and complications
idris is a language with haskell-like syntax and full dependent types so i can illustrate the idea in idris with greater clarity



32539274
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
the log location is clickable in google-chrome but not in firefox
i have used floatinglomas solution with some tweaks as it does not quite work on firefox the stack is slightly different



32540697
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
create a swift file in your objective-c based project
no need to create bridging headers since they re used to see objective-c code from swift not swift code from objective-c



32553395
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
define a precision for which you decide whether a double value is an int or not
test whether the rounded value of the double you have is a correct result



32577390
stdout fflush
Pattern(s): 2	
when you interrupt the script there s a good chance the stdout buffer isn t fflush
in your program immediately after every printf add an fflush stdout to fflush the buffer



32577661
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
your 2nd for-loop is buggy as well
your loops simply not running because it return false on



32604219
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
as mentioned in the question itself this behavior is visible only in google-chrome and not firefox for reasons unknown to me
firefox produces an output similar to the expected one even when a extra padding + margin is added to the body and b when the image itself is wrapped inside another container which also has padding + margin



32626401
setinterval clearinterval
Pattern(s): 5	
your setinterval is declared inside a function so it cannot be reached from another function
that means your clearinterval doesn t find counter



32661217
bufferedreader bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 1	
well a bufferedwriter is not used to get input but rather to output information but assuming that you meant a bufferedreader then the answer is yes definitely
understand that a gui and getting data with a bufferedreader are orthogonal concepts -- they both can work just fine independently of the other



32699996
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
keep in mind that getter setter cannot have the same name as properties that you set in the constructor
you will end up exceeding the maximum call-stack with infinite recursion when you try to use the setter to set that same property



32705026
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
as mentioned by others the whole point is that objective-c provides base class for all classes while swift does not
nsobject in objective-c provides alloc and init methods hence one can expect that a descendant from nsobject will either implement or inherit those methods hence you can have the shortcut-category you mentioned in your question



32717264
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 5	
so while a dictionary is a type of map maps are a much broader range of possible function
in practice a its usually the mapping function that defines the name so a hashmap is a mapped data structure that uses a hashing algorithm to link the key to the value where as a dictionary doesn t specify how the keys are linked to a value so could be stored via a linked list tree or any other algorithm



32733997
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the reasons it is not an answer are a that sets are un-ordered so the for-loop doesn t necessarily process elements of my_list in the order that they are stored in my_list
and crucially b that a set cannot contain duplicates so and loops will process duplicates only once not multiple times



32737403
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	
2 by using intel atom x86 and x86_64 an intel cpu which is use hardware acceleration of android emulation
3 by using mips another form of embedded processors not so popular



32773730
listview gridview
Pattern(s): 5	
a gridview is used as a supplement control to a listview to provide style and layout
the gridview does not have its own control related properties such as background and foreground colors font properties size and location



32788507
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
you should be using innodb rather than myisam as myisam is not robust enough for the cloud environment
innodb has built in caching as part of it s buffer pool



32790754
scipy sympy
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are talking about symbolic differentiation then as far as i know numpy and scipy do not provide this you already noticed how to calculate derivative at the point
so it looks like sympy is your only option



32810949
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
otoh calloc does the zero-initialization of the allocated memory if you need that
to cut the long story short because malloc is not designed that way



32828887
strdup malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
the memory in strdup is created by using malloc not new
strdup - duplicate a string



32855841
bower npm
Pattern(s): 3	
if you get bower command not found responses it can be either because you haven t installed bower or because bower isn t in the path
to install bower you need to have npm installed and then you do the following terminal command



32862488
wildfly jboss
Pattern(s): 5	
wildfly is using slf4j as defult logging
you have to tell jboss not to use slf4j i am using log4j



32886678
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
you just need an app token no user token to do this search but using this client-side is a bad idea since it would expose your app token publicly
simply do this server-side not client-side



32906273
scipy sympy
Pattern(s): 2	
mystic depends on numpy and will use scipy if it is installed however scipy is not required
mystic utilizes sympy to handle symbolic constraints but it s also not required for optimization in general



32909153
easymock powermockito
Pattern(s): 3	
your easymock version is too old
powermockito isn t required for that



32919699
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome chromium allow folder upload when webkitdirectory attribute is set
firefox does not allow folder upload currently though user can upload multiple files at single file dialog when multiple attribute set set allow_dirs attribute at firefox



32925121
git-clone git-init
Pattern(s): 5	
git-clone doesn t accept the git-dir command
it like git-init takes the argument for the repository path on the command line



32953457
free strcpy
Pattern(s): 5	
and you free memory not allocated by calloc or similar functions thus causing error in your program
use strcpy to copy string to origstr -



32988229
sctp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
sctp is not better than tcp in any way but it does something different
tcp emulates a reliable ordered stream of octets over an unreliable unordered packet transport which is conceptually very similar to reading from a file without the ability to seek



33060996
printf strcmp
Pattern(s): 1	
printf checks for null arguments so if is null then printf will print null
on the other hand strcmp does not check for null and it will crash if you pass null to it



33063682
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	
one hash is enough
for security md5 is not the best method hash is much better



33075612
uiblureffect uivisualeffectview
Pattern(s): 5	
a uiblureffect object applies a blurring effect to the content layered behind a uivisualeffectview
views added to the contentview of a uivisualeffectview are not affected by the blur effect



33084402
nexus artifactory
Pattern(s): 5	
this is solved by configuring your maven repository nexus artifactory from not allowing overwrite of the release repos
in nexus we have a repo for snapshot and one for releases



33106891
httpresponse request
Pattern(s): 5	
response middleware to that httpresponse and return the result
here we will return a httpresponseforbidden response in case the request did not come from a specified country



33112706
uilabel uibutton
Pattern(s): 5	
to define a range for the attributes you have to create a uilabel set an attributed string to its attributedtext property and then create a uibutton with a custom view
when you want to use this approach you have to know you have to set the target and the action to the custom view because the uibutton does not longer handle it



33125984
glassfish weblogic
Pattern(s): 2	
it is still the reference implementation for java ee so you can expect glassfish to be around for as long as java ee is
oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere



33125984
glassfish weblogic
Pattern(s): 3	
oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere
it s also important to take note of the payara project which provides support for glassfish but also is actively looking for and fixing bugs in the upstream codebase



33147994
memcpy memmove
Pattern(s): 1	
or you can use memmove which permits overlapping memory space memcpy is not safe for overlapping copies
memmove is more efficient than a loop though optimizing compilers may solve that



33172634
division multiplication
Pattern(s): 5	
note that for signed number the pencil and paper method for multiplication add and shift and division may not work properly
for example the correct method for signed multiplication is booth algorithm



33205560
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
your for-loop logic isn t totally correct
if the body of loops gets executed then your success function will return i which will be 0 and the rest of the function body will not be run



33226927
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
when you used between against int field you specify the whole int and not part of it and hence you got the result including it
the difference is because of the chars following c



33243406
mariadb gtid
Pattern(s): 5	
one thing you need to understand that article briefly mentions is that each mariadb s gtid implementation can cause problems in this situation
since each node maintains its own list of gtids and galera transactions do not have their own id it is possible that the same gtid does not point to the same place on each server see this article



33270067
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome is very forgiving when it comes to css syntax error
safari not so much



33277967
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
this results in every parent being returned where the parent field contains the whole parent document and the children field returning either an empty array if the parent has no children or an array of child documents
i wanted a similar result to neil lunn s answer except i wanted to fetch all parent regardless of them having children or not



33281103
freepascal fpc
Pattern(s): 2	
this will instruct freepascal to use the delphi dialect to compile the unit
delphi will ignore the directive because fpc is not defined



33285651
ng-init ng-controller
Pattern(s): 3	
that s why initialized values from the ng-init are not available inside the controller
basically the reason behind ng-controller getting called first is the priority



33308627
fullcalendar momentjs
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want it to use your local time you need to set timezone local in your fullcalendar options object because fullcalendar is not ignoring timezone anymore
if you want it to use given timezone italy rome you may want to check moment-timezone as well as moment-timezone-data for it to work momentjs is the main dependency



33317525
viewdidload viewwillappear
Pattern(s): 5	
call data download in viewwillappear and not in viewdidload
in viewdidload hide the tableview



33361911
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 5	
because it conflicts with the -description method in nsobject recall that core data dynamically generates properties accessor and mutators a properties named description would require creating an accessor method called -description
note that a properties name cannot be the same as any no-parameter



33374245
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
it s failing in firefox because you ve tried to reference the ie-specific global event variable which google-chrome also provides as a bone thrown to ie-specific code as sdgluck pointed out
firefox doesn t have that and so the code throws an error



33400670
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
firefox will also have a value of 0 but it will also factor in the values
unfortunately safari will not record consistent pagex pagey values for keyboard events and ie will record the exact location of the mouse when the keyboard click event was fired



33405117
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
your for-loop does not provide the user with a way to manually exit
to allow the user to manually exit loops you ll need to write it to accept user input within loops and provide an exit condition



33422591
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if your logo is not in images folder then delete the reference for images folder
if your logo is in images folder in root directory not in your wp theme



33426807
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp is not always faster than tcp
there are many tcp performance turning including rss vrss



33432289
ionic angular
Pattern(s): 1	
it s better to use ionic and ionic material together as ionic material is a material extension to ionic
ionic material extends the actual ionic namespace in js renders material styles on the ionic elements following ionic s conventions and will aim to follow the releases of ionic and support material theming ink and motion for any new ionic release which explains why ionic material + angular would not be a great choice either



33434999
ocl uml
Pattern(s): 1	
so therefore i guess ocl should be able to navigate in both ways regardless of the navigability
the navigability indication in uml is not absolute but merely an indicator of how you can easily navigate



33463528
width height
Pattern(s): 2	
added 100vw to the width not necessary for problem at hand
added height 100 to .here and .about



33480938
pop-up dialog
Pattern(s): 5	
the pop-up is rendered as a child of the body it is outside the bootstrap modal dialog
as a result the bootstrap modal dialog does not allow anything in the pop-up to be focused



33486181
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
file acceleration software goes over udp instead of tcp essentially masking the latency and increasing the speed of the file transfer
one negative to using this approach is that your clients will need to download special software to download their files since udp is not supported natively in the browser but you mentioned they use a download manager already so that may not be an issue



33503006
qobject qwidget
Pattern(s): 1	
furthermore you really should make it a true qobject not a half-made one
and don t shadow qwidget s own members like witdth etc. with your own of similar names



33519460
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
the easiest way is to ignore the sigint in the children and wait waitpid in the parent sigint handler
i also tried to include this in the sigint processing block but the for loop isn t paused so new child processes are created and parent doesn t die



33529105
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
when calculating the page you d want to use the height and not the width
because the view geometry has already rotated by the time targetcontentoffsetforproposedcontentoffset is called and so what was the width is now the height



33535194
setuptools pyinstaller
Pattern(s): 5	
it seems that pyinstaller can not extract the content from setuptools .egg that you installed
my workaround is to manually extract setuptools .egg from python lib directory python_install_path lib site-packages setuptools .egg to the same directory of the problem script and run pyinstaller again



33553280
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
ie and google-chrome have slightly different implementations because of that
firefox does not have an implementation of innertext yet



33555419
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 3	
please not that this solution only works in google-chrome and safari but not firefox
since firefox does not yet support column-span



33563883
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 3	
for this you might want to consider using uitextview instead of uilabel which doesn t give you access to how it manages layout the text
by disabling editing selection and scrolling uitextview behaves roughly the same as a uilabel except some padding you have to remove



33579976
ng-init ng-controller
Pattern(s): 3	
that s why initialized values from the ng-init are not available inside the controller
basically the reason behind ng-controller getting called first is the priority



33587346
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
your for-loop is incorrect
since the condition will evaluate to false and loops will not be entered



33620309
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
if the margin has 0 width height the margin edge is the same as the border edge.
in the page you linked 10.6.1 the height property doesn t apply but the height of the box is given by the line-height property. so since height doesn t apply then the margin-edge is the same as the border edge



33620309
margin height
Pattern(s): 5	
if the margin has 0 width height the margin edge is the same as the border edge.
in the page you linked 10.6.1 the height property doesn t apply but the height of the box is given by the line-height property. so since height doesn t apply then the margin-edge is the same as the border edge



33667116
strlen strdup
Pattern(s): 3	
c strings are supposed to be nul-terminated and strlen doesn t account for this
perhaps using strdup would be better here



33684307
packets multicast
Pattern(s): 3	
multicast packets do not usually get past routers
this post s answer explains why multicast is not a good choice



33687360
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
docker add will add when it is a folder not an url relative to the source directory that is being built the context of the build
so you need to be sure your current directory when doing docker build



33704573
icmp udp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp nmap also facilitates the udp scan where icmp based port unreachable packet shall be returned in case the udp packet arrives on a closed udp port this also depends on the stack in the os
unlike tcp the udp is not a connection-based protocol and icmp is also connection-less so you might need to send some significant number of udp packets for a short interval and evaluate based on the responses or some similar logic



33721207
np-hard np-complete
Pattern(s): 5	
the decision variant asks whether there is such a subset of size k and is np-complete making the optimization variant np-hard
the sets here are always exactly 4 elements which is still np-hard it wouldn t be if the sets had exactly 2 elements which is an easy problem



33728487
csv tsv
Pattern(s): 1	
tsv is not just csv with tab delimiters it s all good if in your case it works
just keep in mind trying to read a tsv using a csv parser is a bad idea as characters such as n or t may be escaped as actual sequences of and n



33736552
lodash underscore.js
Pattern(s): 1	
debounce.cancel is implemented only in lodash with this commit underscore.js does not implement it
if you re using underscore.js or lodash here s a quick and elegant way to solve this problem



33761969
easeljs preloadjs
Pattern(s): 5	
easeljs doesn t have built-in support for cors so you have to specify it on your images before you load and pass them in
preloadjs does have cors support



33811151
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome is honoring the img s percent max-width when computing the minimum intrinsic size of the flex item
firefox is not



33863960
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
note that the descendents of a flex container beyond the children are not flex items and flex properties don t apply to them
hence any flex code added to .nav-wrapper or .navimage would be ignored unless their parent became flex containers



33876140
fink homebrew
Pattern(s): 5	
macports and fink are package managers for os x like homebrew
as the message says homebrew doesn t work well with these two so you should either stay with macports or fink or uninstall them and use homebrew



33891521
starttls smtps
Pattern(s): 3	
no explicit check for the 200 response code in the client script no exception due to a failed starttls attempt therefore mail transport not encrypted
explicitly calling .starttls on smtps servers not supporting starttls - or a mitm stripping this capability from the servers response - will raise smtpnotsupportederror



33929528
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
fgetc returns an int not a chars
on a system where plain chars is a signed type this means you mistake a valid chars often ÿ u+00ff latin small letter y with diaeresis for eof



33938277
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
if you follow the linked reference and check the u format you will see that without any prefix it prints an unsigned int and not a uint8 which is probably an unsigned chars
the correct format for unsigned chars is hhu



33947712
pdfsharp migradoc
Pattern(s): 5	
it was already mentioned that pdfsharp does not need a filename as images can be read from streams
migradoc still requires a string



33948620
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
this is because we are outside the range where adjacent int are exactly representible in double
of course a 64-bit double cannot represent all 64-bit int



33960222
ubuntu-server centos
Pattern(s): 3	
better use a new version of ubuntu-server working well for me of fedora server
centos is not compatible with janus-gateway



33960777

that s because swift knows what a protocol extension is
but objective-c doesn t



34004017
skip-lists tree
Pattern(s): 5	
in 1989 or 1990 as a student i implemented both it was not a good implementation of the skip-lists i must admit i was a novice in that time
however the avl tree was not anymore difficult to implement

fish bash
Pattern(s): 1	
fish doesn t but instead uses command
start bash and execute the unmodified command line



34027280
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
of course since serializable is not the same as
deserialization i don t understand how this is an explanation for the



34048525
spannable charsequence
Pattern(s): 5	
but if you do + n + line it gets converted to a string so the stuff you have in spannable will not be applied
in settext is checked if the provided charsequence is an instance of spanned



34052819
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
and also remember to call the destructor yourself before calling free since free doesn t call destructors either
malloc allocates a memory block but does not actually construct an object there so it will contain garbage



34094310
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
there are two major differences i int require less storage space - this may be significant for larger vectors and ii when interacting with external code that has greater type discipline conversion costs may come into play
as is for coercing to a new class and double technically isn t a class but rather a storage.mode



34111505
des aes
Pattern(s): 3	
and no des is not secure and in fact has been in brute-force range for at least a decade depending on attacker capabilities
it has been deprecated since about 1999 in favor first of triple-des formally tdea and then aes and was officially withdrawn about 2005 as i recall



34145209
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
as a result if one wants code to be compatible with aggressive compilers one must refrain from having any pointers point within an object which is going to be realloc ed unless one can guarantee that such pointers will never even be examined after a successful realloc takes place
as far as the c standard is concerned the behavior of realloc in all cases where it succeeds is equivalent to copying the memory block to some arbitrary location calling free upon it calling malloc to create a new block of the requested size and returning a pointer to the new block in cases where the malloc wouldn t succeed realloc is defined to return null without disturbing the original block



34160974
rpm yum
Pattern(s): 5	
but the rpm does not install unless i manually erase the gpp-1.10 pkg
until erased yum says nothing to do for some reason



34185527
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 5	
suddenly a simple dictionary isn t enough you might need a tree of choices attached to each identifier found in the map or a more complex mapping of the identifier with signature data to a scope entry
in many algol like languages look in another scope requires going up the lexical nesting of blocks so each map must have an association with a parent scope



34225828
metaclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
a metaclass could generate a piece of guard code for every overriden method which calls the inherited method automatically before or after the overriding method has executed
the downside here is developers will not be expecting that the inherited method is being called automatically and have no way to stop that call if a precondition special to the subclassing is not met or control when in their own overriding method the inherited method is called



34249916
clang llvm
Pattern(s): 3	
from a couple of years the default compiler in os x is clang llvm and not gcc
the linker is telling you that it cannot find openmp libgomp this is due to the fact that clang does not yet include it however the support seems now complete and you can install it by downloading the latest version of llvm



34260915
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
make sure the engine is innodb not myisam
myisam silently ignores transaction statements start commit



34266530
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 1	
for example if your filesystems does not support utf-8 but the file-name is encoded in utf-8
as you are using windows it is worth noting that windows filesystems fat fat32 ntfs are not utf-8 aware

beanstalk is basically a machine with amazon linux wired up with some predefined scripts for node.js in your case
it will work only on amazon-web-services not locally



34275278
salt md5
Pattern(s): 3	
usually a salt is randomly generated for each user and stored together with the password in the same object database row
furthermore md5 should not be used anymore



34281876
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
same variable declared in subclassing does not override the value in superclass
to reflect the value associated with superclass you need to pass it to the constructor and set the superclass variable using the super keyword



34306723
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
so if you don t mention the width it extends end to end
but the height is not so



34340645
getter setter
Pattern(s): 3	
the getter do not have any parameters passed onto it
the setter should have only one parameter passed to it



34383266
free malloc
Pattern(s): 2	
malloc will not free the allocated memory
you need to use free to free the allocated chunk



34383821

i installed a new virtual machine openvz containter ct with debian 8 and had the same problem at start i thought that the problem was with the upgrade but having the same problem with a new fresh debian 8 install i have search for new solutions
the problem it s that i was running proxmox 3.2 which uses a linux kernel not compatible with debian 8



34396685
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
you are trying to assign which is a floating point value a double to an int variable
a double is not an exact int so in general an int variable cannot hold a double value



34396831
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
when you convert 4.8657 double to int.the int value will be 4.primitive int does not store decimal numbers.so you will lose 0.8657
in your case 0.7 is a double value floating point treated as double by default unless mentioned as float-0.7f

udp tcp
Pattern(s): 3	
udp is inherently susceptible to packet loss and the lost packets cause distortion
tcp is not lossy and if there is some delay client-side buffering in the pipeline you should be able to avoid distortion due to jitter caused by occasional packet loss and retransmission at the tcp level



34594573
bnd maven-bundle-plugin
Pattern(s): 1	
the blueprint parsing capability of maven-bundle-plugin is provided by the class blueprintplugin part of maven-bundle-plugin not bnd

folder dir
Pattern(s): 2	
selecting a random file from a given folder is not too difficult
first you need the count of files using dir b to list them and find c to count them



34712450
geocoding geocode
Pattern(s): 5	
the reverse geocoding requires an internet connection
but if you only need latitude and longitude using reverse geocode is not necessary



34712804
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome implements an offsetwidth in the svgtextelement prototype which allows jquery to return a width
but it s not a standard property and firefox doesn t implement it



34752537
pchart phpexcel

first you want setinterval not settimeout
settimeout only executes once after the specified delay while setinterval executes once every interval



34848710
min max
Pattern(s): 1	
by translating each vertex you can create a region defining the outline of the object or you can just use min max to create a simple bounding box to surround it
every object in blender has a bound_box property this is in simple axis min max not an optimal rotated bounding box



34853495
int double
Pattern(s): 2	
this is defined by the standard but it will in no way do what you are trying to convert an int to a string you need something like snprintf this is an example
also fabs returns double not int so you risk an overflow if you assign the value to an int



34865802
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
therefore ints+sizeof int is incorrect it should be int + 5
sizeof returns the size of the given type in number of chars s not the number of elements in the array you have the wrong units



34911765
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
one major factor is the content of the object you are resizing if you use scale and the object has content it will also scale everything inside while width height will not
one of the differences in using scale vs width height is the use of css but you have to keep in mind while using scale it will resize from the center of the object while using width height it will be from top left



34923153
min max
Pattern(s): 3	
note that the min isn t important
max works just as well



34945129
decoder encoder
Pattern(s): 5	
maybe the header of the file required to initialize the video decoder is not at the start of the file but at the end and the browser has to download the whole file until it reaches it
this is uncommon nowadays but old video encoders used to place the mp4 header at the end of the file instead of at the beginning because it simplified the encoder s implementation



34952956
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
your for-loop is weird
this loops is not entered when



34962619
keystore jks
Pattern(s): 2	
since jks is not supported on android i made a copy of the keystore and renamed the extension to .bks on the new one
then i used a program called keystore explorer to convert the keystore.bks to bks-v1 format so it works on android



35020493
gridview sqldatasource
Pattern(s): 5	
you could continue the way you are and create a separate sqldatasource for each of the child gridview but i m guessing the amount of child gridview is not constant
in that case you will need to get rid of the child sqldatasource and bind a data source such as a datatable to each child gridview



35039172
std ostream
Pattern(s): 1	
or simply std ostream s wouldn t work mdash
because std ostream has no accessible default constructor

in the following example two subclass instances are correctly identified and their references returned to caller
using fhkfindfirst ... to find superclass instances not as intended



35101230
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
if the for-loop is not mandatory and i don t see this requirement in the quoted text you should use the filter method
when you invoke filter on an arrays you get a new arrays containing only the values that do respect the closure you passed to filter



35118008
google-chrome firefox

in this case an int pointer cannot legally well-defined point to element
second edit using a chars pointer is valid because the following reason given by the original answer



35136370
qmap qvector
Pattern(s): 1	
edit according to the documentation qvector appears to be movable but qmap does not support move semantics
however as arpegius and the documentation point out qvector does copy-on-write optimization so as long as the copied vector is not modified then the data won t be copied



35142148
vundle pathogen
Pattern(s): 1	
but anyway vundle is not a good choice if you don t have access to the internet
instead you can use pathogen which doesn t try to download plugins and only loads them



35142599
python-daemon daemons
Pattern(s): 5	
the python-daemon code doesn t dictate how to use that daemons in a service
to implement the service you need something to run that daemons systemd init upstart launchd all can do the job



35144848
cppcheck cpplint
Pattern(s): 1	
you can use only avrgcc checkpatch clang_check clang_tidy cppcheck gcc make oclint pc_lint sparse splint for c
cpplint isn t included in the list of syntax checkers for c which are used by syntastic



35155294
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
a temporary file that you can completely ignore named dependency-reduced-pom.xml will have been generated inside the root folder this is considered an open issue with this plugin
the shaded artifact will contain your initial pom unchanged inside the meta-inf directory and not the reduced pom this is not really important but better mention it - there was an issue about this that was closed automatically mshade-36



35212350
super self
Pattern(s): 5	
the most important thing to remember about super is that inside foo.go you do not know what class super foo self will refer to because you do not know if self is an instance of foo or a descendent of foo
despite its name super does not necessarily refer to a superclass



35214904
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 1	
the reason i like to use settimeout and not setinterval in these situations is that settimeout is only called after the previous function has completed
setinterval can get back-logged and freeze up your page



35256897
hex binary
Pattern(s): 3	
00000001 is really a number and you can writer it on any other form but coincidently for decimal is 1 for hex is 1 too

Pattern(s): 2	
point 2 the last for-loop does not work
you do not need a loops to print out the encrypted message



35359182
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 1	
with stdio 3 output streams that refer to terminal devices are line buffered like stdout while stderr is not buffered
the program above exits immediately after fprintf so stdout is fflush then



35377983
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
your code will spawn many many theoretically up to 50000 children not just one
the parent probably keeps running a bit when the os lets it but you may not be able to see its output under the storm of output from the numerous children it kicks off



35394814
awk ksh
Pattern(s): 5	
the best solution would be a small awk program doing everything awk will loop through the input so write something without a while

you can add same for few more browsers ie opera safari... to be sure that script will run on users machine
script will not run if firefox is not preinstalled



35490303
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
now use -resize 1000x to give your svg a new width the height will be calculated automatically to keep the aspect ratio
one pitfall of this is that i don t really know how you could resize based on the height and let the width be calcualted since -density is applied to the width not the height



35494994
folder directory
Pattern(s): 2	
you have to create a folder to store the images in your project and then call to it your folder name in front of the image name
otherwise you can find the image by going through the entire directory which isn t a good way as it takes longer and when you move your project it won t be a working link as the directory will be different



35497576
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
1 run the for-loop for not because you start with zero so you need to run the for-loop for one counter less than
2 it will instead of because you need to find element of arrays to be already pushed in new arrays or not



35498168
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
it is not recommended since variable-scope is not ideal and the basic for-loop is simply the standard and expected format for this use-case
foreact loops can not be used if

google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome ignoring flex-basis in column layout
google-chrome safari not filling 100 height of flex parent



35546457
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
when looking at the headers for each you can see that googleadservices doesn t send any cors information which should cause google-chrome to not load the resource
this is what firefox does however google-chrome seems to require the attribute to properly block



35556459
java.util.calendar java.util.date
Pattern(s): 1	
java.sql.preparedstatement.setdate int java.util.date java.util.calendar is not applicable actual and formal argument lists differ in length

you asked for the minimum ips not in the range
since you can t do math on varbinary i would suggest simply getting the max in range and doing the math outside of sql



35595555
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
one other thing worth pointing out is the a signed integer can take one negative value more than it can positive which has a consequence for rounding when using integer to represent fixed point numbers for example but am sure that s better covered in the dsp or signal processing forums
as the name suggests signed integers can be negative and unsigned cannot be



35636620
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the difference is when working with large lists the first variant has an overflow problem undefined behavior with signed int not working as expected with unsigned
lets illustrate on the chars type with range 0..255 unsigned and -128..127 signed int just has a wider range but the problem remains



35753106
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
if the chars is not representable as a single byte in the compiler chars set its type will be int
in the case of visual studio with the windows-1252 source file doesn t fit so it will be of type int and printed as such by



35805359
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 1	
it s tough to gauge from the parameters you posted but just based on you saying that this works perfectly in safari but doesn t work in google-chrome or firefox it sounds like this could be a cors issue
firefox and google-chrome have different requirements for cross-origin requests than safari



35831287

incidentally strncpy will not null terminate the destination if the size argument is less than the length of the source string



35856651
nfa dfa
Pattern(s): 5	
if you have a regular expression without any optional such as ab the nfa graph doesn t have to contain any epsilon edges
an important concept in nfa simulation and nfa to dfa translation is the epsilon closure a set of states reachable from a state by following epsilon transitions



35961684
addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 5	
since your question seems to be of a general nature where addition may be any operation that can be combined with assignment i can off the top of my head only think of an example with multiplication
with bignums the multiplication process cannot be done in-place



35963680
rpm yum
Pattern(s): 5	
rpm does not have dependency solver
yum dnf has dependency solver



35963680

your script claims this email is sent from gmail which is not true
not clear whether your server signs emails with dkim or not does it have spf or not



36054455
erlang elixir
Pattern(s): 1	
if i m not mistaken erlang doesn t know how to handle utf8 in char lists as well so it might be implemented this way for historical reasons
however elixir is nice enough to convert utf8 characters in a char list literal to the appropriate code points so you can later convert it to a binary and get the proper utf8 characters



36061774
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
looks like yaml serializable doesn t like it
i used deserialization with specified type as you mentioned and this is what i get



36069197
tostring gethashcode
Pattern(s): 1	
just make sure that tostring is correct i added null check so it does not throw an exception
gethashcode - not sure where you got your implementation from



36075711
strcpy strdup
Pattern(s): 5	
and strcpy is not safe you d better use strncpy instead
you d better use strdup and include string.h



36106376
oncreate setcontentview

activities are run in order of the android lifecycle so oncreate is not called first
it is just the first opportunity you have to call setcontentview to inflate your layout



36129569
foldable traversable
Pattern(s): 1	
checkers tests your traversable instances by testing functor and foldable all together it derives foldmap and fmap from your implementation of traversable and make sure they produce the same result as foldmap and fmap you defined
your foldable instance doesn t traverse the tail of the list



36131357
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
similarly at the end of the for-loop will not cause any effect since at the beginning of the next iteration s will be zero again
you probably meant this line to be inside the while loops it has the wrong indentation level for that though



36152767
onmousemove mousedown
Pattern(s): 1	
the way how you calculate the pan in onmousemove is wrong
you have to calculate the distance to the mousedown position not sure what you are calculating now



36198391
python-daemon daemons
Pattern(s): 1	
the problem wasn t in the python-daemon not calling the functions it s the logging that didn t work
when the daemons creates a new process it doesn t transfer all file handles from the mother process - therefore the logs aren t written



36202432
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
this function expects the folder to be empty
since your directory is not empty a fallback comes into play which relies on php s filesystemiterator



36212467
inline-functions inlining
Pattern(s): 3	
an inline-functions should be as fast as a macro if it is indeed inline by the compiler
note that the inline keyword is not binding but just a hint to the compiler which may ignore it if inlining is not possible



36241181
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
you ll have to start using a vector of chars not int
this is because and int is usually 4 bytes and a chars is 1 byte



36258545
width margin
Pattern(s): 5	
so to calculate the width including the outline you need to explicitly add it
note even if you decide to take the elements width including margin you wouldn t get the outline-width value by just using outerwidth true



36266049
glfw lwjgl
Pattern(s): 5	
ostensibly this is what java s awt api is supposed to be but again awt and swing have performance problems glfw does not
lwjgl is a wrapper for glfw but also a wrapper for the broader opengl api including functions you d normally have to manually load in c c++ typically through what s called glew or the opengl extension wrangler



36295821
theano keras
Pattern(s): 1	
theano has low-level primitives to build machine learning models and on itself does not define any layers or optimizers and you would usually use it with some deep-learning library such as lasagne or keras while mxnet is higher level
so fare comparison would be mxnet vs keras not mxnet vs theano



36308646
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 2	
use to redirect stderr 2 to stdout 1 or fork the process and manually deal with all three streams
popen catches stdout not stderr



36313996

36330941
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 2	
best to use a for-loop to go through the list and print the elements
this is a problem you re not really hitting at the moment though because your while loops isn t being executed at all



36337550
gulp-concat gulp-watch
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem is that gulp-concat doesn t push the concatenated org.css file unless it receives an end event from upstream
since gulp-watch never emits the end event gulp-concat just hangs indefinitely



36344612
stdout fflush
Pattern(s): 5	
nothing is written to stdout which is what print does before it s fflush
this happens implicitly when print ends with the standard newline but when you provide a different end like this and the string is short the implicit fflush doesn t happen



36366808
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
for example if you discover that google-chrome takes the 152x152 apple touch icon well now you know what you need
problem you probably want to support all scenarios android google-chrome ios safari etc. not only the new tab of ios google-chrome



36374630
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 3	
so first it checks whether comparator is provided if yes treemap uses compare method to compare keys otherwise it uses comparator method of comparable for comparison
treemap uses comparator method of comparable not equals method from object when it tries to put an element into map



36382690
background-image background-color
Pattern(s): 5	
also setting background-color will not work because browser treat background-image first
to display background-color instead of background-image simply delete the image



36407197
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
int is an integral type while double is not
from the comments it seems like op is asking for standard quote which defines const int as a compile-time constant but const double as not



36408121
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
firefox doesn t include an origin header on same-origin requests
but chrome and safari include an origin header on same-origin post put delete requests same-origin get requests will not have an origin header



36415237
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
a subclassing is an extension of the superclass and can access any public protected package members and methods in the superclass
the superclass cannot access members methods of the subclassing unless you cast this to the subclassing



36456932
bash subshell
Pattern(s): 2	
bash will not optimize away the command-substitution subshell because cmd1 | cmd2 is not a simple command
so it will create a subshell to execute the pipeline



36476269
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
or as nina points out in a comment a for-loop going backward
in that case since we re modifying the arrays not creating a new one the changes will be visible through any reference to that same arrays not just myarray



36491695
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
some pieces of code also use the getter setter specifically and not the fields so making sure your fields have getter setter is a good practice overall
for example apache beanutils.copybean will not copy a bean if getter setter are not set



36499752
cdr cons
Pattern(s): 2	
thus a chain of pairs where the last cdr is not matches this
append is a procedure that uses cons to make a list with all the elements of the argument lists left to right

Pattern(s): 1	
in firefox you get good output code from above but in google-chrome you got just next code
it is a bug for sure and it is a module related because for some reason google-chrome not read values which are set in module

pbkdf2 hash
Pattern(s): 3	
although pbkdf2 uses a mac algorithm internally so i can understand if you were confused by that.
encrypting a hash isn t what a mac does either

google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome might be different
i believe in firefox you cannot access indexeddb if you open an html page from file



36697425
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
first note when you mentioned -ofast that s for objective-c not swift
the flag for swift is just -o



36724453
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
if the container is flex-direction column then equal height becomes equal width
here s a detailed review make flex items take content width not width of parent container



36739592
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome seems to allow this i do not know why but firefox is somewhat stricter
basically firefox is following the intended behaviour google-chrome is not



36779703
innodb tokudb
Pattern(s): 1	
engine innodb will create you an xtradb table
tokudb is not at all supported on homebrew mac os x in any way and likely will not even compile



36782453
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
the int value -128 is converted to signed chars which doesn t change the value
that is then converted to unsigned int which yields uint_max+1-128 assuming 32 bits this is 4294967168



36823113
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
the above extract would imply that the behavior in firefox is correct whereas the one in google-chrome isn t but as boltclock points out in this answer the spec s editor s draft has been updated and the updated text seems to imply that google-chrome s behavior is the correct one
maybe firefox will change the behavior someday but since this spec has not reached maturity it may take time



36842622
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
string to int conversion is not possible because string contains chars and not able to convert them to int
double to int conversion is not possible in hive because the data might loss in the conversion



36870968
tensorflow cudnn
Pattern(s): 5	
therefore tensorflow won t attempt to call cudnn when training this model
i m not sure that tensorflow will automatically fallback to a slower convolution algorithm when cudnn isn t available



36876497
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are trying to check for a certain filename you should check it in filenames and if it is a success the current folder is root
directory doesn t enter the picture



36899645
printf getchar
Pattern(s): 5	
printf is not waiting it is getchar instead
getchar uses a buffer behind the scene



36954493
uicollectionview uipageviewcontroller
Pattern(s): 3	
a customized uicollectionview is probably the best starting point for what you want
a uipageviewcontroller will not do what you want



36957962
interbase firebird
Pattern(s): 5	
interbase has support for android starting with the xe3 release iirc
you can t connect to firebird on android because firebird does not support mobile oses



37035773
dns spf
Pattern(s): 1	
finally the majority of dns services all offer easy configuration of dkim and spf ssl isn t something that is provided at the dns level it is merely part of the lookup to validate it
when the dns system was first conceived there were two addressing mechanisms that were used



37054078
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 5	
i suspect this is because the binary was compiled on ubuntu not on amazon linux
i also setup amazon linux that aws lambda based on red hat actually runs on



37065742
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 2	
you could use a for-loop to do that
the do while loops is not doing what you are expecting



37084871
hex binary
Pattern(s): 3	
the reason hex is seen quite a bit in code is simply that it allows the common 8-bit width of bytes to be represented with exactly and just 2 hex digits which is reasonably concise and not too hard for humans to get used to
it s easy enough to mentally convert back to binary while not losing track of which digits you re looking at the way you can with a 32-bit or 64-bit value in binary



37088930
theano lasagne
Pattern(s): 5	
and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn
they are built on top this does not mean theano cannot be used for the same purpose



37192041
hive hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
as an example if you create an external table called table_test in hive using hive-ql and link the table to file file then deleting table_test from hive will not delete file from hdfs
external table files are accessible to anyone who has access to hdfs file structure and therefore security needs to be managed at the hdfs



37199197
udp tftp
Pattern(s): 5	
udp puts the source and destination ports in the udp header and ip puts the source and destination addresses in the ip header
tftp doesn t specify what s in the ip header but that doesn t mean there s nothing in there



37205099
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 2	
so the short answer is no there s no way of stopping this via angular - and currently there doesn t appear to be a way to tell google-chrome not to do it either
it turns out it s not angular that s doing it it s google-chrome safari does not have the same behaviour haven t tested other browsers



37212270
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the for-loop is not needed anymore
there are two keys in the dictionary under iss_position key so loops turned twice



37221078
ucma ucwa
Pattern(s): 1	
as such ucma is not available for skype for business online office 365
ucwa is a restful web api that acts on behalf of a single skype for business user

ucma ucwa
Pattern(s): 3	
ucma is not available for skype for business online for the reasons explained in this question and answer
ucwa is now available for skype for business online



37258522
jar war
Pattern(s): 1	
the reason that you can not run a guide with run on server is because of spring-boot adheres to the slogan of make jar not war
the guide sample code are not things you deploy on a server i.e war but are standalone java apps jar which contain their own embedded servlet container if they need one



37301743
filewriter bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 3	
filewriter is not buffered so writing to it writes immeditately to disk
bufferedwriter writes first to a buffer in memory



37317290
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
when you read this file from your c++ program output the values as int not as chars to determine the correct values
outputting it as a chars requires an output codepage to be used consistent with what you expect



37317726
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
your lua code is a tcp server not a udp one
also remember that udp is connectionless.



37379071
int chars
Pattern(s): 2	
after this line your passing marks which is int to write int c which is in printwriter class
which is responsible to write your int as single chars not as int value if we go deeper it is calling write int c in streamencoder class if you see source code of this method



37446769
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
after playing around with different sticky and fixed footer solutions i found that applying a flex of 0 0 auto to the footer to let google-chrome act the same as firefox
it seems that with a flex-shrink of 1 google-chrome shrinks the footer when in this position where firefox doesn t and as the default value for flex is 0 1 auto this caused the footer to be mishapen on google-chrome but not firefox when in this position



37461717
bison lemon
Pattern(s): 1	
yacc and bison allow terminal symbols to have either alphanumeric names or to be individual characters included in single quotes like this or
lemon does not allow this alternative form for terminal symbols



37462987
hash md5
Pattern(s): 2	
using hash to check your files are downloading okay is probably fine depending on the hashing algorithm you use
while hash collisions are possible with for example md5 i do not think this is very likely



37486538
setinterval clearinterval
Pattern(s): 1	
cleartimeout and clearinterval shouldn t be interchangeable as they re designed for settimeout and setinterval respectively
besides settimeout and setinterval both do different things settimeout tells a set of commands to wait until execution and does it only once while setinterval does that repeatedly until the end of time unless you call clearinterval of course



37486538
clearinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
cleartimeout and clearinterval shouldn t be interchangeable as they re designed for settimeout and setinterval respectively

37507413
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
maven will not do this however if there s no value available at this time
therefore you can remove these properties from pom.xml and let maven plugin define them later in build lifecycle



37517589
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 1	
note i was able to achieve the above functionality in google-chrome only as at this stage mozilla firefox provided limited support
whereas safari has not provided webrtc support so it was out of the picture from the beginning



37521232
pyenv virtualenv
Pattern(s): 1	
i have created a 2.7.11 virtualenv using pyenv and installed python2-pygame with pacman
with my virtualenv activated i couldn t import pygame from python



37572073
ashmem jni
Pattern(s): 5	
the java class java.nio.mappedbytebuffer wraps ashmem and provides read write methods to access it
unfortunately if you re using shared memory to boost performance multiple round trips through jni aren t an attractive proposition



37589637
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
a radio button is way of determining a choice between elements similar to an input text
checkbox are not radio buttons



37603728
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
as it says here you can make asset bundle in common folder and set property sourcepath using an alias or absolute path to directory with your scripts and styles
the scripts directory may not be web-accessible

nexus artifactory
Pattern(s): 5	
as of now nexus doesn t support cocoapods
and artifactory does since v.4.5



37648206
virtualenv conda
Pattern(s): 2	
i finally resorted to using conda to set up an environment rather than virtualenv
apparently virtualenv is not compatible with anaconda



37763767
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
unlike objective-c which is a proper superset of c swift has been built as an entirely new language
swift cannot compile c code because the syntax is not compatible



37792336
excel.application outlook.application
Pattern(s): 3	
boring answer because word.application and excel.application are entirely different types with entirely different implementations
outlook.application doesn t expose an activate member either



37795834
dlsym dlopen
Pattern(s): 1	
so in your example the call to foo uses the symbol from the preloaded module and dlsym would return the same symbol if you had called it with a null handle
however the call to dlopen does not take into account the symbol you are looking for for obvious reasons



37803160
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
well calling free is not mandatory as your os will reclaim the space allocated by malloc when you program ends but as long as your program runs you may be ocupying more space than you need to - and that s bad for your program for other programs for the os and the universe as a whole
malloc x creates space of size x bytes on the heap for you to play with



37833560
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 1	
if you re sure you want checkbox and not radio button
checkbox are generally square and several can be checked radio button are circular but only one out of a group can be selected



37857677
imagemagick pillow
Pattern(s): 5	
it would be interesting to know if imagemagick is using this library under the hood or has its own implementation of the standard
unfortunately pillow pil doesn t understand the smpte digital picture exchange format yet



37882863
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
if you return true here you ll receive subsequent touch events in ontouchevent and children will not receive any more touch event until the current event is over pointer removed
children view can request the parent to disallow interception with viewgroup.requestdisallowintercepttouchevent boolean they usually do when they recognize a touch event in progress and they do not want the parent to interrupt it



37903333
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 2	
swift doesn t support objective-c s dynamicism
for better or for worse this means that in order to swap out the usage of this selector with a block you d probably need to perform some black magic to make it work and you d have to use objective-c constructs to do that



37931330
maven m2e
Pattern(s): 3	
the way eclipse handles maven projects is currently through the m2e plugin
m2e does not invoking maven underneath but parses the pom.xml files and for each plugin mentioned invoke code explicitly written to behave identically inside m2e as the plugin



37958963
quicksort heapsort
Pattern(s): 3	
that s because all elements will match the pivot so after the pivoting step which separates the array into three parts the left and right parts will be empty and the quicksort will terminate immediately
heapsort doesn t have this property it always runs in o n log n



37959011
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
instead the files in these directory must be individually symlinked to the target folder which is either a preexisting folder or one that must be created as a regular folder on demand
that is the only way to guarantee that the existing content of the target folder is not invariably lost



37962610
qframe qwidget
Pattern(s): 5	
qframe is not a special case it applies to all widgets
the default qwidget paintevent does nothing



37965050
erlang elixir
Pattern(s): 5	
erlang since elixir is built on top of erlang and compiles down to erlang and the beam vm you have access to every erlang module and package
so if you are worried about using elixir and missing out on all of the features of erlang you shouldn t be



37989563
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
children are not changed directly without at least letting this service know about it
this service sets the parent s change date explicitly



38064859
persistent transient
Pattern(s): 5	
the persistent column shows the number of objects that currently exist while the transient column shows the number of objects that have existed but have been deallocated
so if you expect an object to be deallocated but the number in the transient column doesn t change then you know the object hasn t been deallocated and you have a problem



38069561
bison lemon
Pattern(s): 1	
unlike bison lemon does not reduce immediately when the lookahead wouldn t matter
bison would have reduced int_literal to array_value as soon as it saw the literal because the reduction doesn t depend on the lookahead



38078412
box-sizing margin
Pattern(s): 5	
also its box-sizing border-box not box-border
for your current html structure you can use .gcrow first-child and set min-width 100vw which is same as wrapper width if you remove default margin and padding from html body



38108115
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
can someone explain what someone explain what objective-c can support that swift fundamentally cannot when developing apps
what i used to take advantage of in objective-c was not so much dynamic typing as dynamic messaging



38114603
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
datasets in the work folder are stored in a proprietary sas format sas7bdat
the work library is essentially a folder in a directory not in a database



38147440
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
you can bridge variadic functions in c to swift but not the other direction
see using swift with cocoa and objective-c interacting with c apis variadic functions for more on that



38186656
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
as in the second case the compiler would infer the usage of an int as the output the result could not fit inside a chars without wrapping around obviously and primarily because the intermediate computations are made in int and not chars
in addition consider that the result actually fits inside an unsigned chars so check this case too



38194589
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
therefore the usage of nstimer is not more swifty but the need for late binding is more obfuscated to make swift developers feel better
if i wanted to use objective-c i d not be writing swift.



38224740
qthread qtcpsocket
Pattern(s): 5	
you can absolutely easily move sockets across qthread just pay attention to four things
1 make sure your qtcpsocket does not have parent before you move



38235016
ant maven
Pattern(s): 5	
maven and gradle have support for dependency management but ant does not
your project should switch to maven gradle introduce a dependency manager such as ivy or hand-roll a half-baked custom solution you can call whatever ant target you want



38274873
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
swift doesn t allow protocols to have optional requirements-- if the protocol declares something it s required
objective-c has long had the idea of optional requirements and swift recognizes this when you use objective-c when declaring the protocol



38321489
hive hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
as an example if you create an external table called table_test in hive using hive-ql and link the table to file file then deleting table_test from hive will not delete file from hdfs
external table files are accessible to anyone who has access to hdfs file structure and therefore security needs to be managed at the hdfs file folder level



38332460
nullpointerexception runtimeexception
Pattern(s): 3	
the nullpointerexception you mentioned is a very good example from the regular exception because it is a subclass of runtimeexception
any throwing of a subclass of runtimeexception does not have to be caught or declared



38333494
joptionpane jdialog
Pattern(s): 5	
joptionpane has a method designed to create a relevant jdialog instance so better try that
manually adding a joptionpane as the content for a jdialog doesn t look right to me



38343517
box-sizing margin
Pattern(s): 5	
please try so because by default the box-sizing is content-box which is meaning width and height properties and min max properties includes only the content
border padding or margin are not included



38347170
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
in swift it gets better with nicer block syntax better type inference and auto-closures
objective-c is not known for it s pretty or terse syntax



38390952
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
though the results i had found that decrementing or incrementing your for-loop contained no noticeable advantage
if the values of the arrays are not truly randomly distributed i found that the simple used in the first implementation is actually significantly faster



38424257
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
save the file and the cloned directory in packages will be ignored while the package control-installed versioning will not
finally you ll need to open the command palette and select package control upgrade package behave toolkit to get the latest versioning



38482617
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome doesn t require such initialization
firefox requires something that we call init here to be set in dragstart event to initialize the rest of drag events to occur



38486581
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
resizing the same image regardless of how many other files are in the same folder now takes the same time
looking at the release notes of 1.3.22 this may have fixed it since mentions many files in the directory i couldn t find the exact commit



38500450
lodash underscore.js
Pattern(s): 1	
underscore.js _.flatten is deep by default while lodash is shallow
underscore.js _.isfinite doesn t align with number.isfinite _.isfinite 1 returns true in underscore.js but false in



38503427
ienumerable idictionary
Pattern(s): 1	
the reason why the dictionary cast isn t working is because ienumerable is co-variant note in the declaration
idictionary isn t



38540476
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
the successive free call therefore tries to free messageptr not the memory allocated by malloc
not only this the malloc ated memory will be lost since you have lost all reference the pointer to it



38547981
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
this means that descendants beyond the children are not flex items and do not accept flex properties
so whenever you want to apply flex properties to an element make sure the parent is a flex container display flex or display inline-flex



38555726
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
and correct way to call the superclass method is no need car.super
since the private instance variable is inherited in the subclassing but not accessible in subclassing you can use the reflection to access it



38619200
gruntjs package.json
Pattern(s): 1	
peerinvalid the package gruntjs does not satisfy its siblings peerdependencies requirements
indicates a library dependency for the project as specified in the package.json is incompatible with the version of another



38656012
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
postgresql doesn t know float but float4 and float8 which are synonyms for real and double respectively
mysql technically knows float but that doesn t mean the db-migrate abstraction will accept is as input when run .



38675102
junit testng
Pattern(s): 1	
junit is not able to run testng tests or features
but at the opposite testng is able to run junit tests



38675261
ienumerable icollection
Pattern(s): 1	
ienumerable is a forward-only iterator
icollection does not have indexed access



38744798
free strdup
Pattern(s): 1	
that requires the caller to take the responsibility of free ing the reversed string
strdup is not a great function because it needs to find the length of the string that is being duplicated which means you end up traversing one extra time



38745471
solaris procfs
Pattern(s): 5	
dtrace on solaris doesn t appear to provide access to process memory usage
in fact the solaris 11.2 usr lib dtrace procfs.d translator for procfs data has this comment in it



38761932
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 3	
from your comments i have updated to first check that the radio button is checked first using
jquery #yesprefcreditlimit .is checked which says if the checkbox is not checked



38802071
pdfbox sejda
Pattern(s): 2	
you could try sejda to merge it s java open source and based on a fork of pdfbox
it can generate pdf files using object streams pdfbox currently doesn t support that and in case it doesn t reduce the size that much you can try to pipe its compress task which goes through the document removing unused resources and compressing images



38831955
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 3	
if that computer needs to be encrypted for security reasons then you re not going to be able to have your daemons load immediately
that computer s systemd volume is encrypted with filevault 2 which means that the operating systemd itself cannot start until one of the users supplies their password which is needed to derive the volume encryption key



38836393
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
an int chars constant has type int . 6.4.4.4 10
assigning an int to chars may not fit but that compiler knows the value of the constant and knows that value is representable as a chars



38854426
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
when you subsequently increment it in the for-loop you get undefined behavior
the assert is likely triggering on the second iteration of your loops not your first



38863713
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
here we need to defined different functions for each step and need to call them one after another via settimeout and not via setinterval
the setinterval calls the code infinite time after each interval where as settimeout calls the included code only once after specified time interval



38878354
scheme racket
Pattern(s): 5	
latest version of scheme r7rs isn t available in racket yet
racket has support for many surface languages



38881503
pandas pytables
Pattern(s): 5	
i don t have enough karma to reply to luke h s answer but reading it into pandas might not be a good idea
pandas hdf5 uses pytables which is an opinionated way of using hdf5



38884993
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
also tried the same extension with google-chrome because i read here that firefox doesn t support background yet the problem of connection breaking persists
the documentation you linked to is about a permission called background that google-chrome supports but firefox does not



38906286
spaces delimiter
Pattern(s): 5	
make sure the file contains no spaces and all the delimiter are in fact tabsl
most likely reason for the issue you see is that the 1 and 0 in the first line of your file are actually separated by 3 spaces not a tab



38928746
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
in the function iterativefile you don t use calloc to allocate startpath and you don t set to null
the memory returned by malloc is not necessarily zeroed



38987604
cloudant couchdb
Pattern(s): 3	
cloudant is horizontally scalable with respect to data size couchdb isn t
cloudant offers full text search couchdb doesn t



38987604
cloudant couchdb
Pattern(s): 1	
cloudant offers full text search couchdb doesn t
cloudant has a different authentication system



38987604
cloudant couchdb
Pattern(s): 1	
cloudant offers full text search couchdb doesn t though you can get it if you re willing to do a custom compilation
cloudant has a different authentication system



39133138
oncreate onnewintent
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are returning to an existing instance of gameover and oncreate is not being called then you will get the new intent delivered in onnewintent
the intent passed to onnewintent should contain the correct extra value



39146651
allocator stl
Pattern(s): 5	
those heap allocator would not be in the union
most stl containers including the std map type cannot be in a union since it has non-trivial member functions



39161368
mouseover mouseenter
Pattern(s): 5	
use mouseenter not mouseover
unlike the mouseenter event the mouseover event triggers if a mouse pointer enters any child elements as well as the selected element



39167523
printf strlen
Pattern(s): 5	
also though printf interprets its argument as a format string - what it ends up printing can be a very different length from the string it was given if it inserts values into placeholders
as bub said part of the difference is that strlen doesn t print the string just returns its length



39210915
temp tmp
Pattern(s): 5	
tmp is a predefined environment variable like temp which contains the path to folder for temporary files
therefore value of environment variable tmp should not be overwritten by something different as this could result in unexpected behavior if one of the used console applications or commands depends on tmp expecting that it contains the path to folder for temporary files



39216914
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 2	
when you invoke a command with sudo you re asking sudo to elevate your privileges beyond what the account normally gets
this is an entirely different system with rules defined in etc sudoers which you should edit using sudo visudo that control which users are allowed to use sudo what commands they should be able to run whether they need to re-enter their passwd or not when using the command and a variety of other configuration options



39264818
nsmutablestring nsstring
Pattern(s): 1	
instead you probably should use the nsmutablestring and append the second string to it
you cannot truly append one nsstring to another because the class nsstring is not mutable



39285668
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
the conversion from double to an int type changes the value by design think to 3.141592654 converted to an int
the conversion from long int to int instead may or work or may be undefined behavior depending on the platform and on the value the only guarantee is that an int is not bigger than a long int but they may be the same size



39299284
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome considers the key to be the meta key while firefox considers it to be the os key
thus firefox does not set the metakey property to true because from firefox s point of view the meta key is not being pressed



39323901
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
udp doesn t have error recovery if there s an obstacle it will just collide with it then continue
while tcp makes sure that all packets are sent received perfectly no errors so the car just passes obstacles without colliding



39396126
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
binary trees have two children pointers not necessarily with references to anything
parent references are not necessary - that is up to implementation



39404261
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
casting an object from a subclassing to a superclass doesn t require an explicit cast
casting an object from a superclass to a subclassing requires an explicit cast



39432088
arraylist treeset
Pattern(s): 1	
it would be easiest to use a sortedset arraylist does not have sorting built in by default
treeset is the concrete implementation and then pass a custom comparator which just delegates to the date object



39436781
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
cast substr col length col -1 as int returns null if last two chars is not a digit
you can check case when cast substr col length col -1 as int is null is not null then .



39482466
asterisk ivr
Pattern(s): 1	
i found that when user hangs up the call asterisk doesn t send sighup to my agi script
it does work when ivr is called from internal network



39513375
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
if names is an empty list the for-loop won t be executed at all which will cause the function to return none
you should change the structure of your function hint you might not even need a loops not an explicit one at least



39569659
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
by default it behaves like so even you make the revealbutton visible always the problem now is this button doesn t work properly
the official recommended method is to create a similar ui for example a checkbox to let a user switch the reveal mode



39604997
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
this is because the return statement is placed incorrectly inside the for-loop not outside of it and inside the function body
hence loops runs once and the function returns



39621731
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
newconfig will receive a new value but it is not a new variable - in javascript the for-loop is not a scope for variables so newconfig actually belongs to the scope outside of the for-loop even though it is declared within there
when your then function accesses newconfig it is accessing the value that currently resides in this global newconfig which is likely to be that from the final iteration of loops assuming the service call takes long enough for loops to complete before a promise returns



39641857
uiview calayer
Pattern(s): 5	
a uiview is not a calayer you cannot add an avplayerlayer to the storyboard
instead after your view has loaded programmatically add your avplayer s playerlayer to the uiview s layer



39662248
installation upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
no without the user s permission there is no way an app can be installed to an android device except if it is connected for development with a computer.the user s privacy permission policy as implemented by google for app installation does not allow any app or device to install a fresh app w o user s permission
however frequent app upgrade can be done w o user s permission



39694448
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
second having at the beginning of your path makes it absolute so it s trying to serve from a folder that doesn t exist at your system s root
to make it serve such that your app directory is part of the path change your root to



39710800
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
int does not accept all ways to write numbers
it understands digit chars used for positional numeral systems but neither rumi nor chinese numerals are positional



39717571
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 2	
if you still want to expose stdout to see the start-up message for example use
you need to redirect stderr not stdout



39740390
decltype auto
Pattern(s): 1	
other than that auto cannot be used as a standalone entity inside decltype x because that would prevent x from being a valid expression
decltype auto is an inseparable construct almost as if it were a keyword like decltype_auto



39781548
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
branch projects the children do not poll in isolation
rather the multibranch project the parent folder subsumes that function as part of branch indexing



39809959
super self
Pattern(s): 3	
unfortunately we can t do this for constants before super is called so those we would need to set up in each method
the reason being is that self does not fully exist yet



39813559
atof strtod
Pattern(s): 3	
atof is essentially obsolete now because it is not robust enough to handle malformed input
however strtod isn t flexible enough to accept particular rules for well-formed input



39826412
vsts tfs
Pattern(s): 1	
vsts is free for 5 users you can start it for free
as giulio vian mentioned tfs 2010 doesn t have the capability of building from a bitbucket repository



39884901
groupbox panel
Pattern(s): 5	
groupbox always have property tabstop enabled in panel you can choose
apart from the appearance panel is scrollable whereas groupbox isn t and groupbox has a caption whereas a panel doesn t



39887356
setinterval clearinterval
Pattern(s): 5	
setinterval does not appear to be cleared
you can define a reference for setinterval then call clearinterval at ended event



39891033
width column-count
Pattern(s): 1	
as per my comment the column-count dictates the maximum number of columns but the column-width dictates the minimum column width
therefore browsers will attempt to spread the text into 3 columns and expand the width of each column so that they fill the max-width of 80 while ensuring column width do not fall below but not restricted to 150px



39921219
botframework bots
Pattern(s): 5	
the botframework will not allow you to reply to a message to a different address than the sender
however if the recipient is one that the bots has received a message from before you can send them a proactive message



39980193
ciimage nsimage
Pattern(s): 3	
in your core image code ciimage is a well ciimage
ciimage has an extent property nsimage does not



39988761
range max
Pattern(s): 5	
max reflects the reality of the values actually used by ruby when iterating over the range or testing for inclusion in the range
in my opinion end should reflect the actual maximum value that will be considered inside the range not the value used at the end of the definition of the range but i doubt that ll change otherwise it d affect existing code



40043690
opera google-chrome
Pattern(s): 5	
i d suggest supporting them both because opera doesn t support vapid but works with gcm
for google-chrome you ll need to either set a gcm api key or use vapid



40093737
richtextbox textblock
Pattern(s): 5	
update i think you originally were talking about a textblock not a richtextbox
if the solution absolutely requires a richtextbox you ll need to look into finding a usable rtf parser somewhere



40108415
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
as int is not a class or array type it has no subobjects
the object representation the underlying array of unsigned chars that constitutes the storage of i is not an object - it s not created in any of those contexts described above



40141741
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
there are also some parts that firefox has implemented that google-chrome has not for instance
ie and firefox implement the svg 1.1 definition of rect elements where x y width and height are attributes



40221741
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
the 1020 width will be taken down to 375 so the height will be 480 1020375 or 176.4705 points
always do the math for both dimensions - if your imageview isn t square or if the height isn t the bounded dimension you ll be off



40229424
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
you should just have a single for-loop to iterate once over both arrays
you also need to handle the case where the two input arrays do not have the same length



40273397
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
you first for-loop is correctly generating the form controls for your model but you have hidden input for the checked property which renders the initial value of the property and its that value which will be bound when you submit the form your just sending back the original data you sent to the view
your second foreach loops is generating form controls which have no relationship to your model and will not bind to your model refer this answer for more details of why using a foreach loops will not work



40284513
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
however after installing this the old folder doesn t get updated and requires a manual update
to do this navigate to library java javavirtualmachines where you will see 2 different directory containing jdk 1.8.0 a directory named jdk1.8.0.jdk and one named where version is the release number for example 111



40286609
visualvm jfr
Pattern(s): 1	
since i work with mc jfr i m not as familiar with how visualvm does it s sampling profiling but i believe it s not using the same method
mc jfr has it s data gathering engine deeply integrated into the hotspot jvm visualvm uses external apis mxbeans



40295322
pop-up dialog
Pattern(s): 2	
i believe the problem here is that the 32feet library is built around legacy pairing so that you either need to know the pin of the device you are connecting to or you supply it with a null to get a pop-up window to enter a pin
that dialog may not have made it through to the new version of windows -



40297998
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
salting ensures the hash aren t predictable
there is a different salt used each time



40304609
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
superclass deinitializers are inherited by their subclassing and the superclass deinitializer is called automatically at the end of a subclassing deinitializer implementation
superclass deinitializers are always called even if a subclassing does not provide its own deinitializer



40305930
testng easymock
Pattern(s): 5	
as i known easymock doesn t support testng out of the box but powermockito does
maybe using powermockito + easymock + testng will work like a charm



40365773
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
where tcp is a stream oriented protocol ensuring that all of the data is transmitted in the right order udp is a message oriented protocol
udp does not require a long-lived connection so setting up a udp socket is a little simpler



40374220
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
check for strictly folder that don t exist by adding nul to the end of your address
the addition of the nul allows you to find only directory and not the these scary extensionless files that look like folder



40391802
strsplit substr
Pattern(s): 5	
in some cases strsplit will split a string on substr having multiple characters
the offset into the string of the beginning of each substr may not be sufficient



40450462
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
when the linearlayout is laid-out a second time its width and height wont change because its size it is based on its parent size not its children
because its layout is not based on its children there is no need for linearlayout to re-layout its children



40450462
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
because its layout is not based on its children there is no need for linearlayout to re-layout its children
this is why invalidating a layout of nearly any viewgroup whose size matches its parent will not cause that layout s children to be laid-out



40545362
range max
Pattern(s): 1	
there is also another option and that is convert the lines to coordinate system of the other bbox and then compute points for each line where one of the x y z min and max and then just test if other two coordinates are in range or not
the initial value of the min max should be the first vertex not hard-coded 0 1000



40552856
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
in your situation i understand that parent component is container component so gets data and send it down to children to avoid problems with sending props to children not mutate it but create new one using immutable.js or just create new object by object.assign
so if your parent component has such code pseudo code



40571005
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
like google-chrome firefox has a use hardware acceleration when available checkbox in preferences advanced general browsing
however unlike google-chrome firefox does not require this checkbox to be checked for webgl to work.



40573513
addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 5	
if they weren t one would need to make them square by repeating them as needed if the above addition doesn t broadcast correctly
if xfactors and self.matrix are both numpy.array and not numpy.matrix in other words if you are using element-wise multiplication and not matrix multiplication in calculating newx and newy then this should do the same thing a lot faster



40636324
playlists autoplay
Pattern(s): 3	
and there is also the cuevideo method which adds the video to the playlists but does not automatically start playing the video
android webview html5 video autoplay not working on android 4.0.3



40653657
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
it seems google-chrome calculates the row height according to the highest image
safari does not calculate the row height according to the images



40661596
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
the result is that when the device rotates the top-level view resizes but each button s position relative to the top-left corner of the top-level view stays the same
turning on the upside down checkbox is not sufficient to allow upside-down orientation on iphones only on ipads



40669373
jgit egit
Pattern(s): 5	
simplified you could say egit is the ui part and jgit the background part
jgit doesn t depend on egit but egit does depend on jgit



40682640
free malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
otherwise or if free ptr has already been called before undefined behavior occurs
since your str is a pointer obtained by adding a number to a pointer obtained from malloc it doesn t meet this requirement and undefined behaviour results



40690288
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s
myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries



40690288
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 3	
innodb has just gotten better faster and more reliable since then
myisam is not being developed



40697754
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
fgetc returns an int not a chars
you can t represent eof with a chars as all of the possible values of a chars are valid



40737264
printf strlen
Pattern(s): 5	
this might be causing the printf to not print the string
please do remember that strlen gives length without the 0



40760567
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
int main int argc chars argv chars envp
to execute your program you should use execvp because you passing arrey of chars not command-line arguments via a variable-argument



40781074
uiblureffect uivisualeffectview
Pattern(s): 1	
the radius of the actual uiblureffect cannot change but there is a workaround
changing the alpha component of the uivisualeffectview will give a subtle blur effect



40820337
ciimage uiimage
Pattern(s): 5	
the heart of the matter is that passing through ciimage is not the way to crop a uiimage
for one thing coming back from ciimage to uiimage is a complicated business



40826134
mvp presenter
Pattern(s): 5	
here is a mvp sample using dagger rxjava and retrofit which might help you to learn more about mvp in android
context is a part of android view layer in mvp so presenter must not have any idea about it and you should not pass it to presenter



40849433
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome has many issues with screen readers that were not primarily written for it such as voiceover safari and nvda firefox
i tested this example myself and the labels were read aloud using voiceover and safari but not with google-chrome - because of these issues



40869328
multiplication modulo
Pattern(s): 5	
before this let s examine the myth of sqrt being expensive but a large bunch of multiplication is not
first of all let us note that sqrt is not that expensive anymore on older cpu-es x86 32b it used to be twice as expensive as a division and a modulo is division on newer architectures the cpu costs are equal



40886823
mouse keyboard
Pattern(s): 3	
you may also poll the mouse polling is not always a good idea anyway with method pressedmousebuttons of nsevent
as you may notice keydown tracks keyboard not mouse so you need to track the mouse



40937708
webchromeclient webviewclient
Pattern(s): 5	
instead of that you can use webchromeclient and set progressbar as below
webviewclient doesn t have onprogresschanged method



40954984
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
note that ch should be declared as int not chars whose range includes negative numbers
having declared it as chars will cause error when reading non-ascii files



40986554
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
the new location of the folder does not have proper permissions
you will have to change the permissions of that directory or enter the information that wordpress is asking you for



40991719
strncpy malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
after strncpy always place a null character in the last position
strncpy doesn t do that for you and any memory allocated with malloc is not zero initialized



41118445
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
maven isn t perfect but i highly recommend using either maven or gradle
to define multi-modules from the root pom.xml make a section like this



41138900
findstr tasklist
Pattern(s): 1	
acts as if previous command findstr was successful then...
tasklist is not able to filter to several pids



41157948
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
if superclass is not serializable then all values of the instance variables inherited from superclass will be initialized by calling constructor of non-serializable superclass during deserialization process
in case superclass is not serializable than to serialize the subclassing s object we must implements serializable interface in subclassing explicitly



41166985
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 1	
other dialects of lisp such as common lisp and emacs lisp have multiple form evaluation in their cond clauses so not allowing it in scheme would only reduce compatibility adding to someone s workload when they convert code from another dialect to scheme
scheme isn t a functional language let alone a non-strictly evaluated one



41167730
free realloc
Pattern(s): 5	
the function called realloc will reallocate the area of memory provided that it was previously allocated with malloc calloc or realloc and not yet free with making a call to free
if free is called on a piece of memory prior to realloc will result in undefined behavior



41184633
strlen strcpy
Pattern(s): 5	
with memset you have also to call strlen for get the length and add one
with strcpy is not required



41186122
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
for etc2 eac images gl_invalid_operation is generated if width is not a multiple of four and width + xoffset is not equal to the width of the texture level
if height is not a multiple of four and height + yoffset is not equal to the height of the texture level



41208515
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
after further research i got to know that google-chrome was throwing this error for a special character æ which was part of my json response body content
however ie and firefox were not having any complaint about this



41211059
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
that is an important thing to keep in mind the maven pom.xml is the lead in this kind of project setup
if you want settings to change try to do that through the pom.xml and not through eclipse project settings directly or doing a project update might revert what you have changed



41266845
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
the idea is that getpreferredsize height called on a jtextpane will return the height needed to display the current content given the current width
if the width is not set yet it will return the height needed if the width of the jtp was the width of the longest line



41281357
converter multibinding
Pattern(s): 5	
the idea is using a normal binding with a converter that handles a collection of items
using a multibinding doesn t really work out for a dynamic collection of binding source items



41292136
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
getter should not be chainable because they need to return the referenced value
setter can be chainable



41321486
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
if it is false the body of loops does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the for-loop
after the body of the for-loop executes the flow of control jumps back up to the increment statement



41355775
bokeh matplotlib
Pattern(s): 1	
bokeh is a python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation
no the purpose of matplotlib is not to make interactive graphics



41360302
automake autotools
Pattern(s): 5	
your second option adding a bootstrap script that calls autoconf and automake to generate the configure scripts is also a bad idea
this defeats the entire purpose of autotools which is to make your source portable across systems including those for which autotools is not available



41376294
decoder encoder
Pattern(s): 5	
base64 encoding is not meant to work piece by piece it s meant to encode a complete block of data as one single unit so when the decoder sees the symbol which appears at the end of each line it thinks it s reached the end and there is nothing left
the proper way to solve this is to go back to your original code and pass the entire string to a base64 encoder not just one line at a time



41411677
build.gradle gradlew
Pattern(s): 5	
the order of declaration in a build.gradle does not matter
gradlew build lifecycle has two phases configuration and execution



41420099
uiviewcontroller uinavigationcontroller
Pattern(s): 2	
but initially it needs a uiviewcontroller to set as a root view controller in both uiwindow and uinavigationcontroller s root view controller they need a starting point
both works differently like uiwindow root view controller can be change at any time but uinavigationcontroller doesn t allow us to change root view controller



41472257
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
however int is implicitly convertible to chars so the assignment operator that accepts a chars is used after the conversion
chars cannot necessarily represent all the values that int can so it is possible that the conversion overflows



41482471
minimum max
Pattern(s): 1	
which either means that values have to be doubled up two distinct bit patterns represent the same value or the usual implementation choice in practice that the maximum and minimum are not equal in magnitude
this is also incidentally the reason that std numeric_limits max typically gives an odd value for unsigned integral types



41488948
x86 64bit
Pattern(s): 1	
the first if condition jumps to main batch code if the batch file is running on 32-bit windows where the environment variable programfiles x86 does not exist at all
the second if condition only executed on 64bit windows jumps to main batch code if it can find the file systemroot sysnative cmd.exe because the batch file is processed already by 64bit cmd.exe



41510865
executable upx
Pattern(s): 1	
it s capable of compressing exe com and sys files and using this sort of executable compression was commonplace back in the day
however two of the three major formats upx doesn t compress are os 2 and windows 3.1 executables



41529693
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 2	
you were correct in writing a for-loop to iterate through the objects in the data arrays however to get the month s name you can t just index the original data arrays
the original data arrays does not contain the month s name



41530710
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 3	
btw you should use g++ not gcc when compiling c++ code
there are significant differences even if gcc is sometimes able to compile c++ or fortran code you ll mostly use gcc to compile c code



41579960
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
#available and friends in swift are a simplification of and improvement on the more complex ways of dealing with new features and backward compatibility in objective-c
if you re using objective-c there isn t a direct equivalent to #available so you have to fall back to those old ways



41585017
uiviewcontroller uipageviewcontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
inside storyboard you have a standard uiviewcontroller subclass not uipageviewcontroller
your uipageviewcontroller is created in code and then added as a subview to this rootviewcontroller



41596525
prometheus metrics
Pattern(s): 5	
prometheus is a metrics system rather than a logs system
there s the mtail and grok exporters to process logs but really that s only for cases where instrumenting your code with metrics is not possible



41622709
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
when openlist is empty the for-loop is never entered
notice that if loops is not entered no return statement is encountered before the end of the function



41656733
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
ok as per mirko vukušić s comparison of this algorithm with .concat and .sort this algorithm is still the fastest solution with firefox but not with google-chrome
the google-chrome .sort is actually very fast and i can not make sure about it s time complexity



41660496
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
note udp does not guarantee data delivery packages can be lost so use udp multicast for device discovery and open up a tcp connection for data that requires guaranteed delivery
tcp listening port can be advertised via udp multicast so that everyone can connect with each other over tcp



41682371
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
the current problem is that your children are positioned absolute therefore they do not consume space inside the parent element
so your parent element doesn t know how big the children are and where the center has to be



41682407
fseek fread
Pattern(s): 2	
fseek does not read from the file it just moves the file pointer around for your next read
you need to use fread to read from the file



41699099
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the for-loop does not
your while loops is actually different to the for-loop



41725677
bash subshell
Pattern(s): 2	
what you may not realize is that by doing so you cause bash to create a subshell to execute the while loop
that subshell is not a full copy of the whole script



41730518
openssl wolfssl
Pattern(s): 1	
openssl does not make this apparent or user-friendly so unfortunately it s something you have to discover as you have
please use the following steps in wolfssl to achieve your desired output



41737096
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 5	
inline expansion or inlining is an optimization where a function call is avoided by copying the called function into the frame of the caller
a function call can be expanded inline whether the function has been declared inline or not



41773260
ssl https
Pattern(s): 5	
the src attribute should point to a valid audio file accessible via an ssl based uri
thus using an https not an http based request



41810481
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
a big reason double ceil double does not return an int type is because that limited functionality is rarely needed
int types have or almost always have a more limited range that double



41900544
flask django
Pattern(s): 5	
you can also have a look at alternative implementation using flask not django on raspberry pi for controlling gpio
django is written in python



41905324
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
if nn 00 the int equivalent is 876097536 so i m guessing the next byte in the stream is 0x09 which will yield 876097545
it seems that 480 is saved in the stream as a chars not an int



41905324
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
it seems that 480 is saved in the stream as a chars not an int
when you go to read an int you pull in 0x343830nn



41961676
alexa amazon
Pattern(s): 5	
amazon alexa will not provide any log information as of now because of security reasons
amazon alexa will not call your backend service if no intent where matched and amazon echo device will reply back with im not able to understand please try again later or it try to match existing intent your created already



41977396
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
where blog is the name of the folder containing your new laravel instance
to install laravel directly within your chosen directory not in a folder within it as demonstrated above simply run the same command but this time without a folder name as in



41993559
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
the mdn examples of collections of primitive types worked on firefox but not on google-chrome
to have an output on google-chrome for your example what you could do is put the transportation variable inside its own array so that google-chrome will print the table



41995534
super self
Pattern(s): 3	
first the call to super should be super new self not super old self
the first argument to super is generally the current class the class whose method is calling super



42027752
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
this is because moving projects between solution folder doesn t break any links between projects as they are stored as relative path hints in the project files
directory structure means nothing to vs



42048340
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 1	
the above error means firefox does not treat multipart form-data as a valid entry in access-control-allow-headers http response header
however chrome safari seem cool about it

i have read that you need apache to run wordpress but this is false
nginx does not use .htaccess



42059742
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
this clearly indicates that there is actually no folder hierarchy for azure storage blob and the folder are just virtual directory for creating virtual hierarchy
furthermore if you are trying to use the microsoft storage explorer to create a virtual directory it also highlights to you that the virtual directory is not exist until you put a blob into it which makes prefect sense since the virtual directory in fact is just part of the name of the blob



42094572
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
whatever is inside the for-loop is not that important rather the number of times loops will run is
this is because the inside part of loops will be some arbitrary number of operations that will just be a constant



42171791
realloc strcpy
Pattern(s): 1	
also calling realloc repeatedly is not a good practice
further usage of strncpy over strcpy is not encouraged by the most so users

children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
remove_widget only deletes a direct children not any descendant
you re calling remove_widget of gui object when your button s parent is actually boxlayout inside it



42196524
viewdidload viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 3	
the reason why is because viewdidload only gets called once and if you are hitting the back button from the navigation controller and its not setting the color as intended that would be the first step to see if it works like you need
without really seeing any code i would assume you need to set the background color of cell in viewdidappear and not viewdidload

google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
no browsers other than google-chrome have shipped html imports support
firefox doesn t support html imports unless you enable the dom.webcomponents.enabled flag



42230524
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 2	
note that the result is a dictionary and not a list containing a single dictionary but it is rather useless to put the result in a list
this works because we first use map to convert the list of dictionaries to a list of counter s



42300804
actualheight rowdefinition
Pattern(s): 5	
but still i confirm that in some case binding to the actualheight is not working as expected
in my case rowdefinition s height was set and it only worked when i bound the itemscontrol.height to the height property not the actualheight



42301343
hex binary
Pattern(s): 1	
decoding a string of hex characters into a binary slice isn t currently part of the crystal standard library so i wrote a decoding function myself
this function takes a string containing hexadecimal characters then decodes it into a slice uint8 or returns nil if the hex is invalid



42306143
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
parent don t know their children because the children don t exist yet when the parent are made and once made no commit can ever be changed
so the children know their parent but not vice versa.

this also includes firefox although not mentioned



42436563
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 5	
lisp then chooses to pun making the empty list and false be the same object scheme does not and treats them as distinct
additionally lisp provides a name for the empty list object while scheme does not and scheme also does not treat the empty list object as self-evaluating while lisp does



42436563
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 5	
additionally lisp provides a name for the empty list object while scheme does not and scheme also does not treat the empty list object as self-evaluating while lisp does
both languages provide a canonical true object as well but again lisp provides a name for it while scheme doesn t



42484693
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
the for-loop does not create any output if the list is empty
so the equivalent do while loops is something like



42495149
ecj javac
Pattern(s): 5	
interestingly the eclipse compiler for java ecj does not include this null check and running nullcheck as compiled by ecj will not throw a n npe.
while i agree with the general consensus of preferring to avoid the getclass hack it is worth noting that as of openjdk version 1.8.0_121 javac will use the getclass hack to insert null checks prior to creating lambda expressions



42559548
int double
Pattern(s): 2	
byte is an object but his behaviour is different form int long and double you cannot use it for basic arithmetic operations
and even if you can assign an int number to a byte object like this

clang llvm
Pattern(s): 2	
clang with microsoft codegen is using clang to parse the source into an ast
but then msvc s code generator kicks in so anything related to llvm is not used



42602035
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
if you want to convert a into an array of int there isn t much work to be done
a chars is already a 1 byte integer



42613789
bots api.ai
Pattern(s): 1	
so if you plan to just target the one service and an audio bots is not relevant to most of the other services supported by api.ai and you are finding the api.ai interface to be limiting then you should certainly consider writing your service with the actions on google sdk
google has said that api.ai is the recommended way to build an agent for actions on google for those who don t need want to do their own nlu



42615848
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
looks like the poly coordinates were off and the width height you specified doesn t match the aspect ratio of the image
my guess is you wrote the coords based on the image s native width height not the re-sized scaled down size you ve specified in the html



42680925
tensorflow cudnn
Pattern(s): 1	
tensorflow does not currently use nnpack to accelerate its math kernels
instead it uses a combination of eigen tensor cudnn cublas xla-generated and hand-written kernels



42704881
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
this is because a submodules git directory is located at folder not inside the submodule itself unless you created your submodule on top of an exsiting repository in the first place in which case you can run git submodule absorbgitdirs to fix this
note that from a fresh clone the folder will not exist until you run git submodule update for the first time



42715342
profiler yourkit
Pattern(s): 1	
in any problem like this get hold of a profiler yourkit is excellent and profile your app at startup to see what s taking the time
yourkit not only will show you hotspots methods taking disproportionately longer times but will also show you any database queries and how long they took



42736898
symfony silex
Pattern(s): 1	
symfony has built-in http_basic_ldap authentication provider which perfectly suits your requirements

profiling debugging
Pattern(s): 5	
visual studio 2012 profiling remotely debugged process
visual studio allows remote debugging but not remote profiling



42943578
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
in other words you can always access attributes so the concept of getter setter functions isn t needed
you can use property though which acts like a way to implement a getter with an underlying value



43007697
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
you are referencing the oak variable as class tree so any property you reference from it should be of class tree not any subclassing because exactly the superclass does not have them thus compiler does not know how to address memory from branches property
worse this addressing might technically differ from subclassing to subclassing an that s why directly addressing properties of a subclassing via reference of type superclass is not possible



43016775
polymorphism specialization
Pattern(s): 1	
these two different types of polymorphism doesn t mix together in c++
each template specialization is a different type which is orthogonal to the others specialization of the same template which means that there is no is-a relationship between such types as you have with inheritance



43018197
jacoco eclemma
Pattern(s): 2	
so if you upgrade eclemma to a versioning which uses jacoco 0.7.3+ it should be fine
on the other hand the illegalclassformatexception you got points to junit s runnotifier class which jmockit modifies at runtime for integration purposes but jacoco should not be modifying



43024435
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
note also that if the initialization expression of a for-loop includes variable declarations such as the following
then translating it into a while or do-while loops is not exactly equivalent because you will then have a local variable i that remains in scope past the end of loops



43033605
ant maven
Pattern(s): 1	
maven gradle ant jenkins are few others
which means maven is not dependent on sonarscanner and you can simply use maven instead of sonarscanner



43038793
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined
single and double quotes aren t interchangeable in c as they may be in some other languages



43059247
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
first of all the issue in your question is that inside the for-loop client.get is invoked with an asynchronous callback where the synchronous for-loop will not wait for the asynchronous callback and hence the next line is getting called immediately after the for-loop before the asynchronous callbacks
at the time of the line is getting invoked the arrays jobs is still empty and getting returned with the response



43082057
ciimage uiimage
Pattern(s): 5	
there is no scale and no screen a ciimage is not something that is drawn so there are no pixels
a uiimage backed by a cgimage is the basis for drawing and in addition to the cgimage it has a scale



43124243
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 5	
you ll have to use vb.net define an autocad command
no sorry vb6 is not supported in forge design automation



43153159
subclass abstract-class
Pattern(s): 5	
any subclass must define a body for each abstract method otherwise it too must be declared abstract
because abstract-class cannot be instantiated they must be extended by at least one subclass in order to be utilized



43193896
spaces delimiter
Pattern(s): 5	
the first function will strip all control characters and replace with a spaces so not to concatinate words like would return as john smith
the second function is a modified parse function to accept two non-like delimiter begin end



43194892
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
also you are using two int values as increments in your for-loop that are always equal you can just use the one
as stated above your for loops are not doing anything to picture rotated



43278201
google-chrome safari

only interpreted-language can execute code at runtime
compiled-language cannot



43297625
free malloc
Pattern(s): 2	
that allows free to know the size of your memory even though free does not get the size parameter malloc got
the same data also allows malloc to know how much space is available and where



43301081
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
if one of the element s children has pointer-events explicitly set to allow that child to be the target of mouse events then any events targeting that child will pass through the parent as the event travels along the parent chain and trigger event listeners on the parent as appropriate
of course any mouse activity at a point on the screen that is covered by the parent but not by the child will not be caught by either the child or the parent it will go through the parent and target whatever is underneath



43360716
crossover mutation
Pattern(s): 1	
mutation does not occur then the only way to change genes is by applying the crossover operator
regardless of the way crossover is performed its only outcome is an exchange of genes of parents at certain positions in the chromosome



43378430
pdfsharp migradoc
Pattern(s): 5	
initially i used pdfsharp dll for this but this did not work for me since pdfsharp can not sense page breaks when i wrote my code i saw that only the ones which fit in the first page is printed
then i learnt that migradoc does sense page breaks and add new pages if needed automatically



43401822
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if the folder doesn t exist then it creates it
then the command changes into that directory and mounts the smb



43469032
react-router redux-saga
Pattern(s): 5	
first if you use react-router it isn t necessary to do direct calls like history.push any more instead it is necessary to use konsistenty and to cause push function from there where it is necessary
secondly in redux-saga there is an access to push action into store - in current case it will be react-router-redux action push with appropriate url



43512573
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
your for-loop is not doing that
when you are trying to access the contents of an arrays you need to always write defensive code and make sure that you never access the arrays using out of bounds indices



43556251
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
also it is worth noting that in your code the you have a for-loop which has a return in it
the return block in this loops only breaks this loops and not the foreach which i have mentioned earlier cannot be prematurely terminated unless otherwise



43648099
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
objective-c cannot see a swift enum at all
in swift an enum is an object type



43680797
config ini
Pattern(s): 2	
the way you are passing app.py tells uwsgi that it s a config file not a python callable
i prefer to use a ini file to configure uwsgi since it s cleaner than adding a bunch of command line options to the dockerfile



43707441
division modulo
Pattern(s): 5	
the symbol is for modulo not division
as your two variables a b are both integers the result you will get from a division will also be an integer which in the case of 300 400 is zero



43718459
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
interesting enough calloc does not allocate the pages either and instead just points to a single zero page
even more complicated is that gcc will convert malloc followed by memset 0 to calloc



43722797
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 3	
the maven-jar-plugin provides the capability to build jars files if you define that your project is packaged as a jar file maven will call implicitly to this plugin
we don t need to define it inside pom.xml it will be downloaded and executed when maven needs it.so does not matter whether you use this inside your pom.xml or not it will get automatically loaded by maven if needed



43722797
maven-jar-plugin pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
the maven-jar-plugin provides the capability to build jars files if you define that your project is packaged as a jar file maven will call implicitly to this plugin

43762715
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
i just realized that in fact this directory is a symbolic link to a folder somewhere else
on the line lib ext git actually looks for a folder but a symbolic link is a file so my lib folder is not ignored



43770736
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 1	
theoretically this make senses and should be possible and it is possible with tensorflow just not keras
the problem keras requires an explicit batch size for stateful rnn

build.gradle gradlew
Pattern(s): 1	
here is the sample project level build.gradle that resolved my error-
issue error with gradlew plugin not getting updated resolved - if you are getting this error you should update the plugin version to 2.1.2 or 2.3.1 be careful it is 2.1.2 and not not 2.12



43776471
build.gradle gradlew
Pattern(s): 1	
here is the sample project level build.gradle that resolved my error-
issue error with gradlew plugin not getting updated resolved - if you are getting this error you should update the plugin version to 2.1.2 as henry has mentioned or 2.3.1



43785824
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
it s also worth noting that your for-loop to do the clearing has several problems
sizeof fs_device_info gives you the size of that struct in bytes but fs_device_info i indexes into an arrays of structs would be the second struct in the arrays not the second byte



43808329
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
my opinion would be that these two should be of the same type and i really don t think it is realistic that these values would ever exceed the capacity of a 32 bit int if not 16 bit
not too mention that float and double are only approximations



43818348
free malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
that means it is indeed allowed to call mprotect on malloc ed memory regions but free will not reset it as there is no way to know the old protection flags so i have to reset the flags before calling free
in fact this is exactly the problem i met when the program runs for a while it randomly crashes in malloc that is because malloc is writing it s housekeeping data into the previously allocated memory and that memory was set to prot_none by an earlier mprotect after i set the memory to writable before calling free the program never crash again



43836305
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
copying an empty text file to every single folder did the trick - i was able to delete the complete node_modules folder
i m on windows 10 and i could nt delete folders with message directory not emtpy



43850350
range max
Pattern(s): 1	
the variables min and max are the highest and lowest port numbers that you want to use and a check also follows to ensure that all the ports in the chosen range have not already been taken
this is done by comparing the range that has been selected from variables min and max producing the variable range and the number of ports that have already been used variable used



43880078
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
setinterval takes a function as its first parameter and you re passing undefined since hidehero function doesn t return anything
btw you should use settimeout and not setinterval in your code there is no need to call hidehero every 3 seconds



43965210
alexa amazon
Pattern(s): 1	
amazon has not publicly released an api to control alexa enabled devices as of now
if you look at the amazon alexa s iftt page there are no actions

cloudant couchdb
Pattern(s): 5	
note however that cloudant does not support rewrites as functions
according to the couchdb docs couchdb has supported this kind of rewriting as stringified functions since couchdb 1.7 but cloudant s documentation doesn t speak about this particular functionality only rewrites from arrays



44054853
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
and if a parent does not have children a filter will be needed after the first map to remove the null lists
this library can be used in any situation where operations need to be performed on children including map sort filter etc but where an older entity is still needed



44072300
median percentile
Pattern(s): 5	
for the median there is an mdx function available
percentile is not yet directly supported looks as a good idea to add but we can user the vector mdx+ function applying the percentile object function



44096737
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	
the calls will be emitted by llvm in case the cpu does not support atomic commands such as cmpxchg
my processors is an armv6 and does support atomic commands

rcharts plotly
Pattern(s): 3	
as a side-note i would say rcharts is not currently developed or mantained at all so i would recommend you to use another library for your charts
in my opinion plotly is quite nice



44269424
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
this generally works well and is pretty simple but centers all children so doesn t work for all use cases
the second gives you a child that will be on its own line display block which will center itself in its parent using equal margins on either side to fill any empty width in the parent margin 0 auto gives zero top bottom margin and auto left right margin



44271825
lxml elementtree
Pattern(s): 5	
the namespace map passed to element and subelement another lxml extension maps that uri to a prefix which is used for the output
python s standard elementtree library doesn t support cdata sections so you ll need to make sure you re using lxml



44348446
packets pcap
Pattern(s): 5	
first split your pcap file using tracesplit into two files - a.pcap and b.pcap where a.pcap will contain packets until the 2 second mark and b will contain the rest of the trace
use tracefilter to filter a.pcap so only packets that aren t 172 bytes long will remain - the filter string is

i then tried google-chrome which doesn t come with a built in parser installed jsonview extension and everything there was fine
did the the same with firefox installed jsonview and



44385233
setcontentview findviewbyid
Pattern(s): 5	
if you make mytext and button as class variables and initializes with findviewbyid it just wont work because setcontentview has not been called yet
in the case of an activity findviewbyid starts the search from the content view set with setcontentview of the activity which is the view hierarchy inflated from the layout resource



44391017
disk ram
Pattern(s): 5	
the table you update on disk is not the table which is used by your virtual users
at the beginning of the test the parameter table is loaded into ram to lessen disk access



44418729
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
so it happens i am dumb and the charset has nothing to do to google-chrome not loading

44481508
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
if it is false the body of loops does not execute and flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the for-loop
after the body of the for-loop executes the flow of control jumps back up to the increment statement



44496443
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 3	
by the way note that sudo supports many authentication methods passwd is only one of them
in particular sudo may not ask for a passwd when using nopasswd so be sure as a minimum to check for the passwd prompt to be present before writing a passwd to a process



44521906
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
so this scenario may be left open for interpretation and google-chrome may not be violating any guidelines
however in another scenario where the height property was a factor firefox stuck with flex while google-chrome went with height why is firefox not honoring flexed div #39



44547476
jar manifest.mf
Pattern(s): 5	
your module.xml which contains spring jar is named as com.sits.grails.hence your manifest.mf should not include org.springframework as its not defined as a separate module
the module names specified in manifest.mf are not package names but module names as define in the module.xml in jboss

in order to customize a seekbar you ll need to extend the seekbar class and create your custom seekbar within a custom view to mimic the playback controls of the mediacontroller
so after a week of playing around with this it seems like the seekbar on the mediacontroller is not customizable



44830164
build.gradle dex
Pattern(s): 5	
i added compileoptions and jackoptions as shown below to my build.gradle to use jdk 1.8
possibile duplicate of android dex cannot parse version 52 byte code



44830267
snmp mib
Pattern(s): 5	
first of all snmp is not that simple
mib stands for management information base and is a collection of information which is organized hierarchically



44831306
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 3	
other dbms for example postgresql wouldn t allow this query to execute at all
saying that how it works internally within mysql is just that you get a unique record for each posts.id but random values from potentially different rows for all non-aggregated and non-grouped column



45001263
erlang elixir
Pattern(s): 5	
you ll need to add the ebin folder of your elixir installation to erlang s load path using -pa or other similar flags like -pz to make erlang load elixir s core libraries as that folder contains the compiled .beam files of elixir core including elixir.io.beam
the error means that erlang could not find a module named elixir.io



45002947
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
when other developers clone pull your personal repo package folder and foo folder will show in master branch
even through there has other ways to show only foo folder on master branch for other developers git fetch and git checkout origin master -- foo but the working directory is not the version as origin master



45045428
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome usually use configuration from ie
and ie may be more strict then firefox and doesn t allow authentication with bad ticket



45054575
subtraction addition
Pattern(s): 1	
therefore subtraction is not associative
on the other hand a+b doesn t cause the same problem since addition is an associative operator



45081016
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
google-chrome is somewhat at fault here as it should use the credentials mode of the request as part of the caching key so a non-credentialed request such as those sent by fetch shouldn t match items in the cache that were requested with credentials
i think there are other browsers that behave like google-chrome here but firefox doesn t



45093506
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
descendants of a flex container beyond the children are not flex items and will not accept flex properties
more specifically the flex property will work only when the parent element has display flex or display inline-flex



45115475
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
this works in google-chrome but doesn t work in firefox
it appears as if firefox is ignoring the initial transform on the object and transitioning from 0 0 instead



45116705
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
those having latest as their versioning cannot be checked and are always listed those marked as auto-updateable are checked and listed only if they are outdated indeed
the command brew cask upgrade also accepts the --greedy option internally it uses brew cask outdated to find the list of packages to upgrade



45139905
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 1	
note that settimeout setinterval has a minimum value generally considered 10ms so if it s less than that value to the next second add 1000
also note that settimeout setinterval are not 100 accurate but for the nearest second will likely suffice



45147067
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome doesn t have duplicate popup if login credentials are incorrect though
the method of explicitly redirecting document.location with username password in url caused me some problems with safari giving a phishing warning



45169443
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
i like this because i don t have to install maven and i don t have to add the maven integration plugin to do this simple thing although the maven plugin does have other features that better or worse might be interesting to some folks
there is a 3rd option use the build step called invoke top-level maven targets in a free-style project where you select a maven installation see below then set its goals clean install or clean install -f subdir pom.xml if your pom.xml is not in the root



45209091
jmeter soapui
Pattern(s): 2	
another option is using taurus tool to convert soapui xml project into jmeter .jmx test script see soapui support and how to convert soapui xml to jmeter jmx articles for more details
itself jmeter cannot however you can record soapui execution through jmeter s http s test script recorder



45245832
hex binary
Pattern(s): 5	
the hex file has a checksum on each line
the binary may not have any checks



45255249
decimal ieee
Pattern(s): 5	
many decimal numbers cannot be represented exactly in this representation
so the compiler uses the nearest available binary ieee floating point number that is available



45260467
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
for some reason google-chrome reloads the tab when you click on it resulting in the default page being opened
when you use ie or firefox it doesn t reload the tab on click



45260497
addition twos-complement
Pattern(s): 1	
this can be most directly seen from the fact that it specifies a single addition instruction not a pair of signed and unsigned addition instructions
in twos-complement arithmetic signed and unsigned addition are the same operation



45263795
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 5	
that is any thread that writes anything to stdout followed by a n that line will be printed on the terminal intact not interleaved
in contrast stderr is not buffered - it s output immediately which means that two threads writing to stderr simulatanouesly will cause the output to be interleaved



45295795
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 5	
next accesses to the properties using dot syntax self.sum are really just a shortcut for calling the accessor
since there are only get and set accessor and not any increment accessor a statement like self.sum++



45317939
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 3	
consequently anything printed to stderr appears immediately while anything printed to stdout will be held until the buffer fills up on linux normally 8kb
note that when ls detects that stdout is not a terminal it sets the -1 flag by default one filename per line



45323133
x86 mips
Pattern(s): 1	
as i don t do mips programming i m not sure which instruction can be used on mips on x86 the not would do
so check through the mips instruction set bitwise operations probably



45387573
public protected
Pattern(s): 3	
therefore public is almost always the way to go
protected doesn t really make sense for daos since you need the methods in other packages in classes which don t implement the dao



45399326
erlang elixir
Pattern(s): 5	
in general keyword in elixir can not be translated to erlang proplists since keys in erlang can be of any type but in elixir they have to be atoms
if you have to have more general way of passing erlang proplists from elixir to erlang there is nothing stopping you from constructing them manually in elixir



45444727
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
determine the full path with pwd var folder b4 qw_sstpn1jqd8ypb1zgc7vww0000gn 0 com.apple.notificationcenter db
this references a directory not a file yet



45466355
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 1	
keras does not include by itself any means to export a tensorflow graph as a protocol buffers file but you can do it using regular tensorflow utilities
here is a blog post explaining how to do it using the utility script freeze_graph.py included in tensorflow which is the typical way it is done



45480611
nuspec csproj
Pattern(s): 3	
when using token replacement make sure your are trying to nuget pack the csproj file not the nuspec file
the nuspec is picked up automatically when given the same name as the csproj file



45514118
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
so_reuseaddr requires a bool 4 byte int not a chars 1 byte
you are passing in a pointer to a single chars but are telling setsockopt that you are passing in a pointer to an int



45514219
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 5	
configured correctly one node could be brought down for patching while the jobs running on quartz continue to process
there are also features of quartz that cron does not provide



45552630
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
you can refer to this answer for additional details on how to create such a repository maven add a dependency to a jar by relative path
the sql server drivers are not available in public maven repositories so unless you have a private maven repository to which you ve added that dependency including it in your pom.xml will not result in the jdbc driver being available at runtime



45559140
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 3	
works with angular on google-chrome but not phantomjs
your safari error is very illuminating and i am kicking myself for not reading it more closely



45587505
build.gradle gradlew
Pattern(s): 3	
is going to extend you the script you have applied it to then if your test.gradle is in the root and you want to access the task defined in that script from your project or any subproject you will need to apply it in the build.gradle in this project because otherwise gradlew will not read it automatically and configure the task
build.gradle is read automatically therefore extending it with your script is going to configure the task you want to use and have it visible for gradlew



45604363
hex binary
Pattern(s): 5	
decode 63697a61f161 hex produces the bytea value x63697a61f161 if bytea_encoding is hex or ciza 361a if bytea_encoding is escape
either way it s a representation of a binary string not text



45620566
uitabbaritem uibaritem
Pattern(s): 5	
uitabbaritem inherits from uibaritem and uibaritem inherits from nsobject
so uitabbaritem is not a view object you can t use xib file with it



45622729
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
in my case google-chrome tools displayed the file name not just author stylesheet
i m not sure if this is 100 accurate but i believe that safari will not show the name of the css file if it is named default.css



45656959
int boolean
Pattern(s): 3	
in this context position should be an int not a string or a boolean
compoundbutton.ischecked returns a boolean not a string so you cannot write



45681753
free malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
edit don t forget that after malloc you use free and not delete to free the memory
i have to note that the usage of malloc is usually discouraged in favor of new in c++



45784970
axios nock
Pattern(s): 5	
but you don t send credentials with your login_request action and hence your axios request body payload.data is always going to be empty
that s why your nock mocking doesn t reply within specified async timeout and jest give this timeout error



45797696
tripledes aes
Pattern(s): 3	
aes is not be supported on client side for gwt but you can use tripledes
tripledes is also very much secure implementation



45867552
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
edit to clarify - bitwise operators will cast any value to a number value to 32-bit int to be specific
most likely you want to use a logical or operator which is || double pipe not | which as you ve pointed is a bitwise or operator



45885918
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
use unsigned int for any int that doesn t need to have a fixed size and will never exceed the range of 16 bits
use chars for chars int and casts to unsigned chars when dealing with library functions that store chars in an int



45929983
ng-show ng-class
Pattern(s): 2	
basically what i did was remove things like ng-hide ng-show from the elements that were supposed to have animation and instead i ve put ng-class to manipulate the visibility while maintaning the animation
the reason that ng-hide ng-show aren t the best ideas for animation is that they apply display block property to your element thus any transition applied to them will not work



45931471
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
just because a file exists in your project folder doesn t mean the webserver makes all of it available
looks like you re trying to access a file in the src directory which is never made statically available



45942374
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
you just need to set the parent element dimensions so its children can take place
as the absolute-positioned children are taken off the regular flow it means that the parent div doesn t contain anything thus it disappears



45958399
mkmapview mkoverlay
Pattern(s): 5	
mkoverlay is a protocol that mkmapview doesn t conform to by default hence the error
adding an mkmapview object to another mkmapview as an overlay simply cannot work since mkmapview isn t just a simple overlay object



45965190
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
this will lead to the outer for-loop advancing down to 2nd row
at that point in time the loops will not go back and print 1st row



46047667
ssl socks
Pattern(s): 5	
note that this is not the method proposed in draft-aft-socks-ssl-00 in 1997 which proposed layering tls over the top of socks framing imo an unnecessarily complicated way of doing it which only provides a single benefit - being able to negotiate ssl or not - with a lot of down-sides
wingate socks server supports accepting a connection tcp and immediately performing a tls handshake on it prior to socks protocol



46102958
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
you read an int not a chars
the isdigit checks if a chars is a digit



46109962
pull push
Pattern(s): 5	
take a note that git pull and git push aren t exactly the inverse operations of each other
git push refuses to push by default when the other side has commits it doesn t have by its own unless -f has given then it will overwrite while pull makes a merge commit



46112717
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
inputstreamreader allow you to read a stream chars per chars using read that give you a int
that int is not the value you a thinking of it is a chars representation of a number so



46136415
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
the break is taking you out of the for-loop not the while loops
you either need to change your while loops to check a variable tied to the char exit or have a second check out of the for-loop



46139340
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 3	
for the second and other times the same statement will not trigger the change detection as the value didn t change it was already john and consequently the accessor will not fire
while for the age properties it s always a value change as it increments



46149428
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
here is a snippet which only works in google-chrome showing a few examples of weirdly accepted and refused mime types
firefox doesn t respect the mime type and doesn t triggers its magic number s checking on bloburis.



46212392
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
usually mssql oracle postgresql etc. this problem can be solved with the help of dense_rank function
but since mysql doesn t have window functions you can do something like this



46220908
integer fractions
Pattern(s): 1	
a number cannot be expressed exactly unless it is equal a fractions of the form where a is an integer b is a natural number and represents exponent
numbers such as 0.1 and 0.2 that are terminating decimal fractions but not terminating binary fractions behave like 1 3.0



46226995
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
you can use a similar approach as in swift blocks not working annotate the block with convention block
to use the objective-c block calling convention and explicitly cast



46259317
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
see below that the first two loops only execute the console.log statements once while the standard for-loop executes the function as many times as specified in this case array.length 6
using the for...in loops for an arrays is not wrong although i can guess why someone told you that



46272284
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
the jar should be located in lib folder and not in bin folder see getting started
any jar file in such a directory will be automatically included in



46272291
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
more pertinently they probably don t share it deliberately because they don t want you to benchmark it and complain when your cpu is not as fast as the core should be
they don t want you to see the processors model and mistakenly think it will do a lot more than they will have it do for you because of some benchmarks for said processors you are aware of



46353161
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 3	
the cellclass parameter in objective-c is simply class with the swift equivalent being anyclass
unlike in swift objective-c doesn t support declaring that the value of class anyclass be any specific type



46354298
dataframe multi-index
Pattern(s): 5	
building an intermediate series of active days from iterating through each row in dataframe and adding each date in the active range to the series and then grouping by date was much slower
running the code in the question on a dataframe with a multi-index did not change the performance



46373477
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
xsd int not a derived type of xsd double
what is important in datatypes is the value 100 xsd int and 100 xsd double are the same value



46391371
jmock powermockito
Pattern(s): 5	
easymock jmock do not support this verification model
as for performance mocking a type with jmockit done through class redefinition probably has a higher runtime overhead when compared to creating a mock object with easymock jmock mockito done through subclass definition and lower when compared with powermockito done through class definition on a custom classloader



46392697
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
this is a problem because int doesn t support division via but rather supports int division via div to avoid a certain class of bugs that crops up in languages that conflate the two
you have a two obvious choices namely convert your int s to something that does support division double or generate random double s in the first place



46454263
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
this will make sure that your current directory also is mounted in container and you start in the same folder inside the container also
the issue is most probably that your mail.conf is in your current folder and not inside the container



46518701
keydown keyup
Pattern(s): 5	
keyup doesn t work because characters are rendered on keydown therefore keyup is too late
you can t have a keyup event without a keydown occurring first.



46524360
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 1	
it is similar to keras in the sense that it provides higher-level abstractions than tensorflow and allows rapid prototyping of neural networks
the principle difference is that unlike keras it cannot use theano on the backend



46530578
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
put your software in the batch file folder and try again
your batch file may be working based on a working directory and because you run the batch file with software that is in a different folder the batch file s working directory does not match



46535557
opera firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
for some reason edge google-chrome and opera were able to ignore maybe that old version of jquery address while keeping jquery javascript to work normally
but mozilla firefox did not behave in the same way and jquery javascript was not working at all in mozilla firefox



46556610
free realloc
Pattern(s): 3	
the function free does not attempt to deallocate storage by calling operator delete
storage allocated directly with malloc calloc or realloc is implicitly declared reachable see 3.7.4.3 on allocation ceases to be declared reachable on deallocation and need not cease to be declared reachable as the result of an undeclare_reachable call



46571166
hex binary
Pattern(s): 5	
do not open hex files in a hex editor because hex editors are designed for editing binary files not text files
a hex file is a text file that you can open in notepad emacs or any standard plain text editor



46605796
alexa amazon
Pattern(s): 5	
you can indeed change the background of an alexa show skill
unfortunately at this time amazon does not offer a bunch of styling functionality beyond that for the show skills



46618471
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
with udp there is no guarantee that the packet will be received on the other side and the sender will not have any confirmation of whether it was received instead on tcp there is such a verification
if you need a connection that ensures that the bytes sent are received on the other side you need to use tcp and not udp



46647889
chipmunk pymunk
Pattern(s): 5	
pymunk is not doing the actual simulation itself but is using a separate c library called chipmunk for that part
chipmunk is written in c and called from the python code in pymunk with the cffi foreign function interface library



46682350
pop-up dialog
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are asking for the reason of that i believe that simply pop-up aren t intended and deeply tested for a lot of interactive content but just for small hints or small navigation menues
if you need to present to the user a lot of interactive content imho a page with the dialog option is a better choice



46682927
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 5	
change it to simple if your daemons does not go this way
for systemd assume the child or child of child of the start command is the daemons process



46729979
tcplistener tcpclient
Pattern(s): 3	
tcpclient doesn t actually use the tcplistener at all
the tcplistener is just the receptionist answering the phone and transferring calls



46761827
getter setter
Pattern(s): 3	
well the getter are just fine since one really has to see the contents of the cart and the number of items in the cart
the setter are not fine



46766548
libstdc++ libc++
Pattern(s): 1	
gnu libstdc++ and llvm libc++ are two different implementations of the standard c++ library
apparently your libstdc++ doesn t yet support the coroutines ts so you have to stick to libc++



46780262
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the function getchar returns an int not a chars
most of the time that int contains only an 8-bit value identical to the chars just fetched from input



46798827
seaborn matplotlib
Pattern(s): 1	
as you found out yourself you need to call seaborn.set to get the default style of seaborn or use any other of the seaborn styles
you can also use seaborn styles with matplotlib and not using seaborn at all



46815116
fileinputstream objectinputstream
Pattern(s): 5	
java fileinputstream objectinputstream reaches end of file eof
bottom line is that objectinputstream does not return null when it reaches the end of the stream



46820408
decoder encoder
Pattern(s): 5	
how it works when encoder encodes number n+1 packet it add there some information about packet n that is useful for decoder if it supports recovery
if decoder does not support recovery then this information is useless and wasting bandwidth



46825073
fgets realloc
Pattern(s): 1	
the call of realloc is not affecting fgets - at least not directly predictably or reliably
the first call of fgets input int_max stdin in stringparser has undefined behaviour because the pointer input is uninitialised



46830950
quad uniform
Pattern(s): 5	
i have no idea what texture coordinates for a box you would like but for a quad i d do something like this
the tex uniform is not set in the code



46843321
getter setter
Pattern(s): 3	
the problem here is likely related to your ability to check if getter setter were actually generated
if your ide tells you getter setter not generated - the ide might be wrong



46870870
pandas pytables
Pattern(s): 5	
the complication of course is that it looks like you are using pytables via pandas and not raw hdf5
pytables is hdf5 but adds a layer of structure and semantics on top of hdf5 s groups and datasets



46953262
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 3	
nginx does not have the 256 connection limit that apache does due to an asynchronous approach to handling connections
not sure what requirements your server has but a basic nginx swap from apache is pretty simple and can be done following step by step tutorials online like this one



46970809
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
as other answers describe the superclass cannot know the type of the subclassing unless it s passed in runtime
if the issue you re trying to avoid is to have to create the map-constructor in each subclassing i see only two solutions each with its flaws



46987382
pbkdf2 salt
Pattern(s): 1	
because the password we want to use wizardsarecool is not 128 bits in length it s actually 14 utf8 characters long so 112 bits we use pbkdf2 which is a key derivation function to derive a key from our password that will be 128 bits long hence the keysize being 128
pbkdf2 takes a few parameters here including the password string the salt which isn t all that important when using pbkdf2 as a key derivation function but we still apply good practice and make it random as we should and an iteration count which determines how many times the underlying hash is applied to the password



47103867
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 1	
both google-chrome and firefox inject the same script in the page to build the rendered text
it seems that safari doesn t rely on this script



47106608
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
in java methods or loops variables are not accessible outside of that you declared in for-loop
in this case you can access spacesln only within for-loop not outside that



47122832
erd entity-relationship
Pattern(s): 1	
normalization is normally done after a conceptual erd is translated to a logical relational model not directly on an erd or in the process of creating one
understanding how entity sets attributes and relationships translate to domains relations and dependencies may invite one to try normalizing directly in the erd but a problem with this approach is that the entity-relationship model isn t a complete and consistent logical model and so some relations may not be representable in an erd



47259214
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 2	
your mistake is one of most common mistakes in js - if not the most common - using a for-loop to manipulate a state variable in an asynchronous situation
your promises and your loops do not run in sync



47291781
avro thrift
Pattern(s): 5	
unlike thrift avro doesn t save any meta information about the avro schema in the data
avro required avro schema to be present at both write and read time



47303184
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
further google-chrome cannot even select which profile out of many is selected when google-chrome is started from the os call url to be opened function and not started by user-activated clicking on a google-chrome application shortcut with specific profile selection instructions
naturally the latter works 100 wonderfully on firefox which has built-in profile selector after the browser has been started and regardless of which method was used to start firefox user click on firefox icon or os pipe of open url to firefox



47338098
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 2	
when publishing to a maven repository using the above method the pom.xml will not have the proper version
to get maven to publish the proper version use the flatten-maven-plugin



47366665
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
the do javascript syntax is for safari not google-chrome
for google-chrome it s execute javascript however changing that doesn t fix your code



47415226
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
these days the folder is not called inbox but the name of the folder seems to be the bundleid of your app
the files that are being imported by the application are actually copied into a directory called inbox within the apps documents directory



47462418
valgrind glibc
Pattern(s): 5	
sometimes suppression files require debuginfo symbols and valgrind couldn t find them in the run you quoted so this is another thing to try
valgrind calls special glibc functions to deallocate memory on process exit while normally glibc just lets the kernel do that



47526256
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
3 is a chars constant to nitpick int chars constant
here to initialize an array of chars type you seem to need brace-enclosed list of chars constants not strings



47561950
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
this orders by the parent id if there is one first then whether the row had a parent and then the final id is only necessary if you want to guarantee the order of the children cannot not change from one execution of the query to the next
assuming the parent s id is always less than the childs you could use something like order by least id subrow id to order first by the parent s then the child s



47583520
build.gradle gradlew
Pattern(s): 5	
depending on the environment in which you re working just adding a dependency to build.gradle might not be handled automatically by ide
please try to run gradlew build from commandline - it should work there assuming that you imports are fine in the source



47596237
fast-forward merge
Pattern(s): 5	
the merge clicky button on github defaults to doing the equivalent of git merge --no-ff 1 which prevents git merge from doing a fast-forward operation
were the fast-forward operation not possible the --no-ff would have no effect so you would not have seen a different result



47603497
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
because your for-loop isn t used other than to repeat your code it ends up looking like this
i would create an arrays of times logged whenever the key is pressed and unbind the key when the arrays reaches.length x



47606479
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
firstly need to call out in scala everything is an object there is no primitive type for your code it s int not like in java but scala need to compile to java bytecode to run in jvm since object consume more memory than primitive type so scala has specialized to solve this it means generate the primitive types parameter method when annotated with specialized with types
so for your code it s tuple2 and it s specialized for int long double chars boolean



47626867
margin height
Pattern(s): 1	
position top left and margin are all html-only properties
and width and height are not valid for elements



47640306
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 3	
if both are installed than keras will use only cpu version
i solved it with the answer given by keras with tensorflow backend not using gpu



47658741
boost stl
Pattern(s): 1	
so either use boost as suggested by other in this thread or write your own function which you essentially already did -
indeed the stl does not have a simple std contains function



47672765
prometheus grafana
Pattern(s): 5	
grafana does not saves data from prometheus
it queries prometheus and displays ui



47696354
runtimeexception unchecked-exception
Pattern(s): 5	
runtimeexception doesn t have to be declared or caught
it s an unchecked-exception that s its purpose



47726681
entity-relationship diagram
Pattern(s): 1	
entity-relationship diagram aren t a good fit for document databases
the entity-relationship model supports many-to-many binary as well as ternary and higher relationships composite keys and attributes on relationships all of which aren t directly supported in hierarchical network model dbmss



47760463
d3.js crossfilter
Pattern(s): 5	
it s usually dom elements that are the bottleneck in d3.js dc not anything on the javascript side
the way dc.js and crossfilter ordinarily support this functionality is that a crossfilter group does not observe its own dimension s filters



47803352
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 1	
according to my best understanding the simplest way to detect whether an ntfs filesystems contains a bootable windows is checking that any of the files bootmgr or ntldr exists in the root directory because one of these files will be loaded by the boot code
the ntfs boot sector first 512 bytes of the filesystems doesn t contain definitive information about bootability because it can be exactly the same for bootable and nonbootable filesystems



47834465
erd entity-relationship
Pattern(s): 5	
entity-relationship modelers can picture this in an erd using a figure for generalization and specialization
but entity-relationship modeling doesn t tell you how to build the tables



47860315
typedef struct
Pattern(s): 3	
but it s seems a bit weird to typedef a struct that s not yet declare at my opinion
when you are declaring your struct your typedef is not already effective the typedef is usable at the end of the structure declaration ie after



47863428
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
i will have stick with google-chrome for profiling our app
after further looking into this i came to the conclusion that firefox does not support runtime analysis for web workers at the moment



47868136
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
getter should not accept arguments and return properties
setter accept argument and set property



47880284
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome seems to always use value while firefox uses textcontent
since google-chrome doesn t look at the textcontent property range#selectnodecontents will select nothing on this browser.



47898071
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
variable a inside the for-loop is not the same as the variable a outside loops so reading its uninitialized value is undefined behavior
since you do not really need a separate loops variable using a while loops is a more common choice



47921548
uicollectionview uitableview
Pattern(s): 1	
uicollectionview is a more recent addition 4-5 years old and provides a much more flexibility
yes uicollectionview duplicates much of the functionality of uitableview but not all



47988188
jgit egit
Pattern(s): 5	
and jgit does not seem to support implement the template_dir option from a git init command see this search
egit is based on a java implementation of git called jgit



47998868
freebsd debian
Pattern(s): 5	
other platforms such as os x and freebsd will require the use of a custom embeddedlaunchscript
notice that debian was not listed



48000861
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
its also worth noting that because num3 is an int when you divide it by 45 you will get an int not a percentage
to fix this issue make num3 a double or cast either num3 or 45 to a double before computing the division



48032098
int boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
so int accepts a string or a number
boolean aren t strings but they are in fact numbers



48042552
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
first of all a dictionary in swift is struct an nsdictionary is class
objective-c is not type-safe so it doesn t show an error



48044072
scipy sympy
Pattern(s): 5	
if this equation was not a polynomial i d recommend using scipy s solvers like fsolve instead of sympy
sympy is not the right tool to find the numeric solution of an equation full of floating point coefficients



48050657
selecteditem selectedindex
Pattern(s): 3	
when the user selects something the selectedindex is set directly invalidating it and changing it which causes the selecteditem to become invalid
however the selecteditem is not explicitly changed until it is recomputed



48062215
hive hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
then actually query against the partition rather than scanning all the rows columns because hive does partition pruning
also hdfs doesn t like files smaller than the hdfs block size 128 mb



48079699
ienumerable ilist
Pattern(s): 5	
another difference in case of ef is that the ienumerable is not executing the query to the db untill you really enumerate the list
while the ilist will execute the query and fetch the items in memory



48097085
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
answer int check string is int or not if yes then give you int and otherwise nil
but float or double can convert any number string to respective float or double without giving nil



48141290
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
int is 32-bit long in 32-bit systems and your hash may generate a value which 32-bit int cannot contain.
your way of splitting up the chars may generate different result from your javascript code as in the comment but you filters the input by limiting the chars within a ... z



48172775
onclick onfocus
Pattern(s): 3	
even if the onblur and onclick do not get along very well but obviously onfocus and yes onblur
since even after the menu is closed the onfocus is still valid for the element clicked inside



48189771
pull push
Pattern(s): 5	
google analytics ga and google tag manager gtm only do stuff when the scripts are executed - so getting the ga file for example via push pull or loaded from cache doesn t matter until that file is run and it registers a hit or loads the tags that register the hits
in fact at a technical level http 2 push doesn t even push any files directly to the page but pushes it to a push cache and which the browser checks first before requesting a file



48265751
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
because their parent have exited the grand children become parented by pid 1
thus signals sent to the grand parent do not get propagated to the ex-grand children



48290196
hash hmac
Pattern(s): 5	
cryptoalgorithm.sha1 as a hash isn t supported because the sha-1 hash function is insecure
you can create an hmac that uses sha-1 with crypto.createhmac which some oauth 1 sources need



48322286
clang icc
Pattern(s): 5	
clang does not vectorize it
you can loop over the elements directly and with the right options gcc and icc will use a vectorized pow function



48342681
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
what you need to do is just store your credentials out side your main application folder i am not sure what system you are running on but appdata works well for windows
this way if the user does copy the directory they wont by chance copy your credeintals files



48380186
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
the simple answer you should not use project directory starting with a dot because for unix-based systems any files and folder starting with a dot are hidden by default
since gradle aims to be platform-independent it may happen that your project is used on such a system and some project directory are not shown to the user



48383795
pascal delphi
Pattern(s): 1	
the turbo pascal string is mostly statically allocated and the string types that are new in delphi are dynamic
delphi strings have a null at the end but are not null-terminated the strings can contain null characters and turbo pascal are not



48392840
uilabel uitextview
Pattern(s): 5	
apple changed uilabel to pull down orphan words so even if you get the lines right a uilabel may not give you the look of what you are doing since it could pull a word down
use a uitextview and disable scroll editing disabled and possibly selection disabled



48449689
crossfilter dc.js
Pattern(s): 1	
you are correct crossfilter doesn t provide ways to expand rows into multiple group bins
when you want to transform your data into a different shape for dc.js to read it a fake group is the usual method



48459697
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 2	
using setinterval is not recommended since the body function theoretically may take longer than the interval causing a stackoverflow
a better way is to use settimeout to call a function which at the end of executions schedules a new timeout for itself



48482514
factors matrix
Pattern(s): 1	
factors is a complex data type made up of chars and int types
matrix cannot hold two types at a time



48514696
uicontrol uibutton
Pattern(s): 5	
you can create a custom uicontrol it has touchup event and put any kind of components on it
if the uibutton doesn t meet your need then you can make a custom uicontrol



48523630
int chars
Pattern(s): 2	
but also since we wish to use int types to express stored raw binary data the type unsigned chars uint8_t is the c language equivalent to a byte of raw data that could contain anything
and that s the reason chars types cannot contain any trap representations etc.



48566863
tensorflow cudnn
Pattern(s): 5	
according to the tensorflow install documentation for version 1.5 cudnn must be installed for gpu support even if you build it from source
there are still a lot of fallbacks in the tensorflow code for the case of cudnn not being available -- as far as i can tell it used to be optional in prior versions



48590929
jasmine mocha
Pattern(s): 5	
jasmine is not designed to run mocha tests and mocha is not designed to run jasmine tests
for instance mocha cannot do anything with jasmine.createspy



48636678
vsts tfs
Pattern(s): 5	
it seems you are using vsts not on-premises tfs
usually login option can be used on on-premises tfs we use the login option to specify the team foundation server user account to run a command



48651809
installation upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
late uninstall major upgrade installation do not uninstall and reinstall files that exist in the same location in the old and the new setups - and this works even when the files in question are not set permanent and never overwrite allowing proper uninstall of the files as well - without any added custom logic
this kind of upgrade basically install as a patch - leaving files that are unchanged between releases untouched and then upgrading other files according to the file versioning rules described above



48659153
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome is not adding the cookie for post requests
in google-chrome firefox the was ltpa2 token cookie is not set for xmlhttprequest



48684378
try-catch exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
for that you ll have to use try-catch within using block
if the exception-handling is not caught you will see an exception-handling raised by the ide with the message an unhandled exception-handling of type system.exception occurred in the catch block



48687827
uisearchbar uisearchcontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
to address a specific point in your question keep in mind that the thing you put in your navigationitem.titleview is a uisearchbar not a uisearchcontroller
you can either create this uisearchbar yourself or you can create a uisearchcontroller and use its search bar instead searchcontroller.searchbar



48715988
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
maven is not bash
pom.xml is an xml file it has tags some of the tags are filled with text



48800576
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
salt if not combined into password hash
authentication will create hash from provided password and stored salt and compare it to stored hash under specified login name



48803345
ord chr
Pattern(s): 5	
but this still uses one function ord to take the code of a letter
chr is not a function here but the way to create a character type chr for its integer code



48868778
translation localization
Pattern(s): 5	
see comparing translation plugins features regarding woocommerce
you can t translate content of posts or pages with something based on .po .mo files because it is only for theme or plugin localization but not for multi language content



48889744
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
for the most part loops do not have their own scope so the variable s scope will be the scope of wherever the for-loop lives
with that in mind if the for-loop is within a function it will have local scope



48915536
filtering grouping
Pattern(s): 1	
a bit field or bloom filtering could also be included. row index entries provide offsets that enable seeking to the right compression block and byte within a decompressed block
note that orc indexes are used only for the selection of stripes and row grouping and not for answering queries



48941706
super self
Pattern(s): 3	
when using super self is passed automatically
also in python3.3 and above super does not even need to receive arguments to know from which class it is being called



48944854
folder dir
Pattern(s): 5	
so if you want to leave your resources where they are you will want to add src main java to the resource folder not src main java com voidustries poly
you are putting xml files in a folder called src main java hint java dir is for java files



48998906
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
if you really want your variables to be chars you need to first use scanf to store them into an int and then assign the values to your resulting chars while you re checking that they re in range since an int can hold a bigger number than a chars
long story short your code is technically broken and you need to use int and not chars here



49026963
plot heatmap
Pattern(s): 1	
you cannot convince heatmap not to produce a categorical plot
best use another image plot which uses numerical axes



49072888
qsort bsearch
Pattern(s): 1	
both of these functions take a callback which is used during the task the function is providing so that the type of the data being searched in the case of bsearch or sorted in the case of qsort does not need to be known by the function being used
for instance here is a small sample program with bsearch using different comparison functions synchronous callbacks



49225330
decimal ieee
Pattern(s): 1	
most decimal numbers cannot be represented exactly in binary format so they have to be rounded
ieee 754 defines several possibilities for this procedure i think you see this one citation from wikipedia



49254638
plot heatmap
Pattern(s): 5	
however this approach adds a title above your heatmap and not the whole plot
one of the solutions could be this the object returned by the plot has an ax_heatmap method that has a set_title method



49254964
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
your for-loop only runs once so if the first item of the arrays matches the date in today it stops and prints your success message
if the first item of your arrays does not match the date in today it again stops and prints the failure message which is also the case as you have said



49281693
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
see if mysql does not have rules about which ips can talk to it i known that postgresql have this feature do not know if mysql does
check that mysql does not have something like drop iddle connections.



49291522
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
if the initial sequence of those chars do not form a valid int say for example it s the | chars the will fail the variable will be unchanged and the input stream will remain exactly where it is
so when you come around again to get the next int | is still in the input stream and exactly the same thing will happen again ad infinitum - note the similarity between that latin phrase and your question title -



49334364
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
at the end of the for-loop you store the value in the arrays and then at the end return the arrays so the end of the method will look like
the calculatebonus will use this returned arrays as input and it will also work internally with an arrays and not an int as you have now



49347039
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
is a number or not you should use strtol instead of atoi unlike atoi with strtol you can check if the input string is the representation of a valid int or not sample
note that you should ensure that you can pass to atoi before passing it and also isdigit is not for telling whether a number is a number or not an int is always an int and isdigit allows you to determine wither a given chars is a digit chars a chars of the set 0-9



49353653
integer fractions
Pattern(s): 5	
here i first check to see if n is an integer or not
if not i use mass fractions to turn n into a fractions then i split the string at and use the two parts in frac from grdevices to render the fractions



49393803
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 1	
see the serializable check where the check is called and where deserialization happens in a non-local cluster
i believe that local mode clusters only test serializable not deserialization



49416206
scipy sympy
Pattern(s): 5	
scipy does not know that
sympy is a library for symbolic math operations such as derivatives



49436505
passenger puma
Pattern(s): 1	
the other issues memory limits and concurrency limits are relatively less important but they can t be mitigated without using language extensions the iodine server is written in c and passenger is written in c++
since puma doesn t currently require any language extensions except for it s integrated http parsers in c and java these issue remain



49438130
phpstorm webstorm
Pattern(s): 1	
webstorm phpstorm project consists of a single module only web_module type
webstorm cannot open more than one project in single frame



49523171
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
in short objective-c generics are type-erasing swift generics are type-preserving
you need the latter for tasks like defining type-constrained extensions but you can t because swift doesn t know anything about the objecttype of any particular phfetchresult instance



49523171
swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
you need the latter for tasks like defining type-constrained extensions but you can t because swift doesn t know anything about the objecttype of any particular phfetchresult instance
the swift-evolution proposal that brought widespread objective-c generics import to swift 3 included a provision for letting objective-c classes provide information about their generic type parameters at runtime.



49529831
gson jackson
Pattern(s): 5	
this is an issue reported to gson team unfortunately seems they insist that javascript has no integer type as if they do not realize that gson is for java not javascript
so they refused to fix it until today 2018 now despite other lib like jackson does not have such issue at all despite how easy to fix it



49562115
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
adding getter wouldn t interfere with your goal to validate an item before it is added to the list
also if you wanted you could also add a setter that looks something like this so the items would still be validated



49582136
octal decimal
Pattern(s): 5	
adding 1 to it and printing it again would yield 100 in octal not 78
as c cannot detect minute overflows when counting with your made-up units the proper route to follow is to convert the input to regular decimal do any calculation you want then convert back to time decimal



49589636
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
static properties accessed in parent cannot be changed by children when using self
static properties accessed in parent can be changed by children when using static late static binding



49604223
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 2	
i don t know if you intentionally want an infinite recursion of a for-loop or not
but if you do you need to check your counter variable s in a debugger to make sure that they match the value needed to execute the statement involved in exiting loops to stop the recursion



49625241
fgets strcmp
Pattern(s): 1	
use fgets to read a full line then check if it starts with exit remember that it will contain the linefeed
the strcmp isn t working since read is not 0-terminating the input it s not doing string input



49626141
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
for udp it s the same only the ip type is 17 instead of 6
tcp udp shouldn t be directly embedded into an ethernet frame



49639543
java.util.date zoneddatetime
Pattern(s): 5	
this class replaces java.util.date and uses a finer resolution of nanoseconds rather than milliseconds
zoneddatetime not calendar



49659080
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
that looks very primitive but has one advantage - manually added source folder is not removed on right click - maven - update project
although your plugin adds extra source directory to project eclipse cannot recognize that



49663249
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
your control logic in the for-loop doesn t work so i ve switched to a simpler while loops
you outer do loops is an infinite loops so i ve removed it



49752193
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
the problem is that for-loop will not exit automatically
it is continually go in loops and wait for next input



49795383
gson moshi
Pattern(s): 5	
in fact gson does not provide runtimetypeadapterfactory per se in its standard bundle
quick googling for a moshi implementation brings your question at the top of the search results at least for me



49797782
tensorflow tensorboard
Pattern(s): 1	
since tensorflow 1.3.0 tensorboard has had its own pypi package but there is a circular dependency between the packages so when users installs tensorflow they will always get tensorboard along that s why you have it installed
however the fact is that tensorflow does really not depend on tensorboard to work and tensorboard does not even have a dependency to tensorflow so it should not be possible that the two packages affect each other in any way



49814963
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
int is not fractions there are int division functions div and quot and their remainder counterparts mod and rem but that s not what you want here because you want a fractions result
the solution is to convert the int argument to a fractions type such as double using fromintegral



49815427
qmainwindow qgraphicsitem
Pattern(s): 5	
only classes that inherit from qobject have the ability to create signals for example qwidget qmainwindow qgraphicsview inherit from qobject so they can have signals
but qgraphicsitem does not inherit from qobject because of efficiency issues so they do not have the ability to create signals



49815427
qgraphicsview qgraphicsitem
Pattern(s): 5	
only classes that inherit from qobject have the ability to create signals for example qwidget qmainwindow qgraphicsview inherit from qobject so they can have signals
but qgraphicsitem does not inherit from qobject because of efficiency issues so they do not have the ability to create signals



49843207
fgets strlen
Pattern(s): 1	
that code was written to be used with fgets not scanf
fgets adds a newline char to the end of the string the user enters and search_for strlen search_for -1 0 would overwrite that newline char with 0



49860883
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
if you re having an issue with the parent container not wrapping it s children it s probably because you are floating elements in which case you can use the overflow property to force it to wrap
if the children elements are positioned absolutely then they are no longer considered part of the normal flow in the dom and you will not be able to get the parent to respect it s height



49902742
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
just a guess but possibly the reason for the difference is that google-chrome fires the event after it adds voices to your page
firefox doesn t so it doesn t



49935648
rubygems bundler
Pattern(s): 1	
after upgrading to it some old rubygems might not function properly
this problem occurs to me when i ran the bundle command bundler is a ruby gem



49936734
icmp udp
Pattern(s): 1	
ping sends icmp packets not tcp ip
so the network over tcp or udp can work great but icmp will be filtered often called something like stealth mode or invisible



49937130
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
also the parent should not wait for children to complete until after launching all the children
in general children will block with full pipe buffers if you make them run sequentially



50028326
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
it should just record the new value and let the getter make the conversion
i agree that the setter does not appear to be useful at all



50042731
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
chars is an int type
if you add together a bunch of chars you get an int not a string



50064565
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 5	
the best solution to boot fs mode is the following but imho ubuntu is not a good option because systemd slows down the boot phase a lot
compile the linux kernel using this config file



50068945
scenekit arkit
Pattern(s): 5	
in arscnview all you need to do is assign that content as a child of the node you get from renderer _ didadd for scenekit automatically takes care of moving the node whenever arkit reports that the face has moved
if arkit cannot track the face because it s outside the usable range of the truedepth camera then it s not tracking the face



50085078
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
the parent will listen to changes from all its modal children and handle them and the children will not know anything of each other preventing circular dependencies
you could place the modal in the parent s component and emit the call to open a specific modal to that parent



50090373
hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
when you receive the get or read the cookie use the data in it to re-calculate the hash and stop redirect error out if the data no longer validates the hash check
when you do this use some server-side salt that isn t displayed in the url or in web page source etc



50140592
lodash underscore.js
Pattern(s): 5	
if you re using lodash the function signatures are different-- underscore.js allows you to define a this context as the third parameter whereas lodash s doesn t
so in our case our lodash was overwriting their underscore.js causing a bunch of weird issues.



50166989
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
public int indexof chars ch
it returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of the specified chars or -1 if the chars does not occur



50195996
wildfly weblogic
Pattern(s): 1	
unfortunately this only worked well in wildfly and not in weblogic
the issue in weblogic was due to the way in which the weblogic bean manager implementation creates a bean



50230369
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
if there are no children receiving that event it can happen in 2 cases no children at the position the users touch or there are children but it returns false at action_down the parent will send that event back to ontouch of the parent
vice versa if you return true the parent will steal this touch event immediately and onintercepttouchevent will stop immediately instead ontouch of the parent will be called as well as all ontouch of children will receive the last action event - action_cancel thus it means the parent stole touch event and children cannot handle it from then on



50253027
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 3	
note that this also covers the no checked answers option while it is possible to start with no radio button selected once a user selects any radio button they will be unable to un-select
use checkbox not radio button



50253027
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 1	
use checkbox not radio button
radio button only allow single choice



50254421
xcopy findstr
Pattern(s): 5	
my guess is xcopy simply moves the file pointer to the end of the current buffer without reading all of the data but i don t know how to test that
as would be expected substituting find for findstr does not change the result when using pipes - there is no way to reset the file pointer back to the beginning of the piped data after it has already been read



50255012
fullcalendar momentjs
Pattern(s): 2	
therefore fullcalendar will not be able to use this data as an event because it doesn t understand the start and end dates
the date and time formats accepted by fullcalendar are the same as those accepted by momentjs since it uses momentjs to work with dates



50260936
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 1	
masking in keras doesn t produce zeros as you would expect it instead skips the timesteps that are masked in upstream layers such as lstm and loss calculation
in case of rnns keras at least tensorflow is implemented such that the states from the previous step are carried over tensorflow_backend.py



50277421
width height

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5

strlen strstr
Pattern(s): 5	
in your code if the strlen isn t the same you need to return or otherwise handle the error not just output that fact
you already have f open as r+ with the file-position-indicator at the beginning strstr will tell you if you have found the word to replace then all you need to do is set the file-positon-indicator to the location of the pointer returned by strstr and write the replacement characters over the search term and repeat for the remainder of the line

octal decimal
Pattern(s): 1	
these escape sequences originated in c or maybe in c s predecessors b and bcpl in the days when computers like the pdp-7 ruled the earth and much programming was done in assembly or directly in machine code and octal was the preferred number base for writing instruction codes and there was no unicode just ascii so three octal digits were sufficient to represent the entire character set
by the time unicode and java came along octal had pretty much given way to hexadecimal as the preferred number base when decimal just wouldn t do
