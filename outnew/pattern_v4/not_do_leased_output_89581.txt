box-sizing margin
Pattern(s): 3	
it s relative to the box-sizing property which is by default content-box example #1 box-sizing content-box includes only the content
border padding and margin are not included means when we set width 300px it is set to the content only then you add the padding and border



50657644
margin border-box
Pattern(s): 1	
border padding and margin are not included means when we set width 300px it is set to the content only then you add the padding and border
console.log document.queryselector .test .getboundingclientrect .width example #2 box-sizing border-box includes content padding and border



50657644
box-sizing margin
Pattern(s): 1	
console.log document.queryselector .test .getboundingclientrect .width example #2 box-sizing border-box includes content padding and border
margin is not included means when we set width 300px content the padding and border



50724661
fpdf fpdi
Pattern(s): 1	
some information to the things you d used before fpdf cannot handle existing pdfs so i guess you d used fpdi in combination with fpdf to re-create the initial document
the free version of fpdi does not support a compression feature introduced in pdf 1.5



50739795
hive hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
as an example if you create an external table called table_test in hive using hive-ql and link the table to file file then deleting table_test from hive will not delete file from hdfs
external table files are accessible to anyone who has access to hdfs file structure and therefore security needs to be managed at the hdfs file folder level



50747897
subnet packets
Pattern(s): 1	
if you don t want to do things that way you have 2 other choices subnet broadcasting works with ipv4 only - your sender can create a udp socket then use setsockopt to enable the so_broadcast option on it and then sendto data packets to the broadcast ip address of a given subnet or use send if it connect s to the broadcast ip beforehand
each packets sent will be automatically delivered to every machine that is connected to that same subnet whether the machines want the packets or not



50764759
daemons launchd
Pattern(s): 5	
since i ve had the same issue with my launchd not being launchd on startup i read some of the apple doc about daemons and agents containing this important if your daemons shuts down too quickly after being launchd launchd may think it has crashed
daemons that continue this behavior may be suspended and not launchd again when future requests arrive



50766272
openmpi mpich
Pattern(s): 5	
from my experience one good feature that openmpi supports but mpich does not is process affinity
for example in openmpi using -npersocket you can set the number of ranks launched on each socket



50769952
irix linux
Pattern(s): 5	
other systems sunos solaris irix define tiocgwinsz and struct winsize
#ifdef tiocgsize # define ioctl_winsize tiocgsize # define struct_winsize struct ttysize # define winsize_rows n int n.ts_lines # define winsize_cols n int n.ts_cols #else # ifdef tiocgwinsz # define ioctl_winsize tiocgwinsz # define struct_winsize struct winsize # define winsize_rows n int n.ws_row # define winsize_cols n int n.ws_col # endif #endif you might notice that linux is not mentioned in the comment



50770228
imagemagick libjpeg
Pattern(s): 3	
if you are going to install imagemagick into not standard path then you will need to specify it s path like below cimg imagemagick_path c imagemagick-6.9.2-q16 convert.exe
if you don t want to install imagemagick then you should link your code with libjpeg library and enable native jpg file support in cimg putting this before including cimg.h #define cimg_use_jpeg #include cimg.h using cimg with libjpeg is definitely better



50771588
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
explanation firefox has a play button center poster and google-chrome does not
this is an obvious indicator that firefox has controls attribute that covers the entire tag and google-chrome does not it s controls are accessible only at the bottom where the bar is



50776212
int double
Pattern(s): 3	
this is why the short overflew but the int did not
the first three outputs from both int and short are easy to explain -2147483648 your method returns an int so overflows 2.147483648e9 math.pow returns a double so formatted like this 2147483648 double casted to a long 2147483648 inside the possible range for long 32768 your method returns an int 32768 is inside the possible range for int 32768.0 math.pow returns a double so formatted like this 32768 double casted to an int 32768 is inside the possible range for int the hard to explain bit is the fourth result



50778838
uninstall upgrade
Pattern(s): 1	
in this case it will never be uninstalled during upgrade but not during a real uninstall either
accordingly you have to manually clean out the service installation and file installation on real uninstall as opposed to a major upgrade initiated uninstall which sets upgradingproductcode



50800594
bionic libc
Pattern(s): 5	
you re building against the android libc bionic which isn t a tested or supported libc to build against
where it has differences or idiosyncracies compared to glibc the standard linux libc you ll need to change qemu to work around those



50847136
ppm pgm
Pattern(s): 1	
using imagemagick i think you want to output to ppm not pbm
try convert image.jpg image.ppm or try the ascii version by using convert image.jpg -compress none image.ppm pbm is binary black white and pgm is grayscale



50847136
ppm pbm
Pattern(s): 1	
using imagemagick i think you want to output to ppm not pbm
try convert image.jpg image.ppm or try the ascii version by using convert image.jpg -compress none image.ppm pbm is binary black white and pgm is grayscale



50859647
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
postgresql pl postgresql oracle s pl sql mysql s procedural dialect are somewhat similar to that but far from being compliant with the sql psm standard
i think the closest to the sql psm standard is db2 and maybe hsqldb sql in postgresql is not the same thing as sql per sql standard



50897289
fgets fgetc
Pattern(s): 5	
indeed fscanf can set the end of file condition of a stream if it reaches the end of file which it does for s if the file does not contain a trailing newline whereas fgets would not set this condition if the file ends with a newline
fgetc sets the condition only when it returns eof



50934141
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
if you wanted to something more like require_relative you have to use some sort of workaround to turn it into an absolute path such as file.dirname __file__ which gives the absolute path of the folder containing the current file
give the path relative to the working directory not the file that you call file.write from



50938501
virtualenv miniconda
Pattern(s): 5	
virtualenv does not work because it uses local python interpreter
my solution is to use conda anoconda or miniconda to build the environment so if you need some packages you can just conda install them



50974659
textblob nltk
Pattern(s): 5	
i explained it here with examples of the better results that replaces this textblob implementation the nltk classifier also has better documentation on how to use your own custom made corpus for sentiment analysis textblob always crashed my computer with as little as 5000 examples
i wasn t able to be certain that a nltk corpus cannot work with textblob and that would surprise me since textblob imports all of the nltk functions in its source code and is basically a wrapper



51009362
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
webm works in google-chrome firefox not safari
i converted to mp4 mp4 h.264 which does not work in google-chrome firefox but does work in safari



51010641
namenode hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
command for formatting hdfs hdfs namenode -format when namenode was not working after formatting hdfs
i was facing the same issue formatting hdfs solved my issue



51018576
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 1	
c++ source files should be compiled by g++ not by gcc
remember that gcc means gnu compiler collection and also contains gfortran and gccgo etc.



51086296
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
but udp may have a considerable packet loss so try webrtc-tcp for your quake idea
here is 2018 update for you your off-the-shelf solutions are red 5 pro wowza kurento unreal media server flashphoner also note that in modern public networks tcp is not much slower than udp



51089278
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
children shouldn t mutate their parent data
they should tell their parent about something and the parent should do something about it



51090185
subclass superclass
Pattern(s): 1	
note that dagger.android will only be able to inject your subclass youractivity not activity itself
this is partly for consistency fragments can be nested inside other fragments such that injecting fragment would be ambiguous if the superclass bindings were automatic



51146679
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
both str.isnumeric and str.isdigit include decimal-like chars that aren t compatible with int
and as abarnert has mentioned in the comments the most guaranteed way to test if a string can be passed to int is to simply do it in a try block



51148417
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
in your case the destination is a folder not file
in this case you may get some exception like could not find a part of the path f new folder while executing the application the current directory will be the bin folder



51149525
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 5	
vb.net doesn t support byte-oriented string methods
vb migration partner provides the chrb6 replacement method which approximates the original vb6 method s behavior but isn t guaranteed to work well in all circumstances



51161749
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
i would rather go with a for-loop that way you can have your an if statement inside the for-loop to switch your loggedon then check it again outside the for-loop
your while loops does not terminate if it doesn t receive a pin that is in your arrays



51257522
email dkim
Pattern(s): 5	
a lot of factors can lead to your email being delivered to junk
just to name a few - your server s ip address is blacklisted you can check it using tools like - you do not have a proper hostname defined for your server - you do not have a proper reverse dns for your server - spf and or dkim are not configured properly try sending an email from your server to a gmail address for example a gmail address that you own



51257522
email dkim
Pattern(s): 5	
just to name a few - your server s ip address is blacklisted you can check it using tools like - you do not have a proper hostname defined for your server - you do not have a proper reverse dns for your server - spf and or dkim are not configured properly try sending an email from your server to a gmail address for example a gmail address that you own
then go to gmail and even if the email landed on junk please check the email headers



51260920
tidyverse dplyr
Pattern(s): 5	
but you can do it this way or in tidyverse language using also purrr package
in dplyr it doesn t exist in base r most probably not



51274969
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 3	
it looks like there has been some work at firefox and google-chrome so isn t treated as mixed content
looks like the crowd at webkit safari are still thinking about it



51274969
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome allows mixed content on and
safari does not allow any mixed content



51280396
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
prerequisitions install git in your local machine check if the local folder already in a git repo in the directory of the folder you want to import to bitbucket repo execute git rev-parse --show-toplevel if it shows not a git reposiroty that means the local folder has not been managed in git repo
else if it shows a parent directory that means the local folder has been managed in git repo steps to import create a local git repo if the local folder not in a local git repo as the prerequisition 2 shows if the local folder has not been managed in a local git repo then create by below commands assume the folder myfolder is what you want to import and it s in c test example myfolder # in the directory c test example git init git add . git commit -am initial commit else if the folder has already managed in a git repo skip this step



51297124
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome is being more generous in parsing the date you re giving it which is a string that looks like 7 1 2018
google-chrome accepts that as a valid date safari doesn t



51298215
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
be default the behavior of checkboxtreecell is if no children are selected then the parent is not selected
if some but not all children are selected then the parent is indeterminate



51318300
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
it should read note that the value is read into an int not a chars
the getchar getc and fgetc functions return an int which either contains a positive number representing the chars byte treated as an unsigned chars or it returns the negative value eof which is customarily but not necessarily -1



51320932
viewdidload viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 5	
you need to set the region of the map in viewdidappear not viewdidload
when viewdidload is called the map view has just been loaded - the map hasn t been rendered yet so you can t set its region



51322396
spaces linefeed
Pattern(s): 1	
syntax notation the following core rules are included by reference as defined in rfc5234 appendix b.1 alpha letters cr carriage return crlf cr linefeed ctl controls digit decimal 0-9 dquote double quote hexdig hexadecimal 0-9 a-f a-f htab horizontal tab linefeed linefeed octet any 8-bit sequence of data sp spaces and vchar any visible usascii character . so whitespace is not allowed in the name of a header
spaces is not a valid character in a header name



51347776
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
for any application-side date-time-values use an int unsigned a bigint signed a double signed or a decimal n p to simply store unix-epoch-deltas. make sure to show the resolution in a column name suffix if it is not seconds
examples mysql_row_created_at timestamp 3 default current_timestamp mysql_row_updated_at timestamp 3 default current_timestamp on update current_timestamp epoch int unsigned not null epoch_ms bigint not null epoch_us bigint not null epoch double not null epoch6 decimal 16 6 treat your database as much as dumb storage as possible



51354904
disk ram
Pattern(s): 1	
at first you have to pick up a place for storing your information hard disk your own server other service firebase ... ram is not useable in this case
supposing you like hard disk option let s select a method for storing create a file json text file ... save your information every time user enter a new one open it to get information back



51365045
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
i first create a chars pointer assign an int address no you create a pointer-to-char and assign the address of an int to it
an int address isn t a thing and integers don t live in some magically different address space to chars



51379062
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
i would set your range at the start use a for-loop and do away with selecting things rarely a good idea
your current code doesn t change aktywnakomorka it remains d2 you just activate the next cell below but your loops does not reference the active cell



51387491
des aes
Pattern(s): 1	
ek3 dk2 ek1 plaintext that is the definition of triple des 3des not des that is encrypt plaintext with des as with key 1 decrypt that result with key 2 encrypt that result with key 3 3des or triple des encrypts three time with des
so aes would be ek plaintext with aes



51387491
3des aes
Pattern(s): 1	
ek3 dk2 ek1 plaintext that is the definition of triple des 3des not des that is encrypt plaintext with des as with key 1 decrypt that result with key 2 encrypt that result with key 3 3des or triple des encrypts three time with des
so aes would be ek plaintext with aes



51393834
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
as ulrich eckhardt pointed out a better way to implement this is to use a for-loop it s more clear this way and the scope of ptr is limited to loops which is good because we don t need it later
str is a 50 element char arrays not a pointer



51399302
try-catch exception-handling
Pattern(s): 3	
in a normal situation try-catch should not be that expensive performance wise as discussed in this thread do try catch blocks hurt performance when exception-handling are not thrown
however throwing and handling an exception-handling is usually a relatively expensive operation



51401598
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
here s one of the approaches create table job id int not null title chars varying not null constraint pk_job primary key id
-- simple job-job dependency time-based dependency complex job-job-dependency construct create table dependency_type id int not null title chars varying not null constraint pk_dependency_type primary key id



51421004
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 1	
a properties that has both accessor is read-write
unlike fields properties are not classified as variables



51424698
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
the correct getter should be getbmdc and not getbmdc as it is in your code now
the correct model class should look like this the setter are not required are always optional because if there is no setter for a json property the firebase client will set the value directly onto the field



51431426
filesystems fat
Pattern(s): 1	
also take into consideration that std filesystems might not be available on all platforms the filesystems library facilities may be unavailable if a hierarchical filesystems is not accessible to the implementation or if it does not provide the necessary capabilities
some features may not be available if they are not supported by the underlying filesystems the fat filesystems lacks symbolic links and forbids multiple hardlinks



51443153
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
single quotation marks around one chars are used for chars literals single quotation marks around multiple chars are interpreted as a literal of int type see here whereas double quotation marks around zero or more chars is interpreted as a c-string
therefore your a+ is an int not a chars or string as you may have intended



51444212
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
row1 a 1 b 2 name 0 dtype int64 row2 a 3 b 4 name 1 dtype int64 row1 a 3 b 4 name 1 dtype int64 row2 a 5 b 6 name 2 dtype int64 row1 a 5 b 6 name 2 dtype int64 row2 a 7 b 8 name 3 dtype int64 but as said rafaelc doing for-loop might not be the best method for your general problem
if you want to keep loops for using zip and iterrows could be a way to access the next row at the same time start the second iterrow one row after with



51459054
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
both dp0 can be replaced also by any other folder path ending with a backlash
the command for with the used options runs in a separate command process started with cmd c in background the command line the command dir searches for just non hidden files because of a-d-h attribute not directory and not hidden in directory of the batch file for files matching the wildcard pattern and outputs just file name + file extension to handle stdout standard output because of b bare format order alphabetically by name because of on



51469306
ucma ucwa
Pattern(s): 5	
ucwa is a web sdk version of ucma kind-of
the ucwa is a lot more limited than the ucma sdk but ucwa works for skype for business online whereas the ucma doesn t directly work with skype for business online



51487568
xsl-fo xslt
Pattern(s): 5	
you might generate xsl-fo via xslt 1.0 or 2.0 but the table you cited lists functions that you might include in the xsl-fo not functions that you can include in your xslt
note that your xslt is generating html not xsl-fo



51506066
pdfsharp migradoc
Pattern(s): 1	
can manipulate via pdfsharp migradoc i did not read document manipulation into the op but i see other answers commenting on the fact
a few stackoverflow q as from 2008-2012 including robert gowland from this question say that pdfsharp migradoc have poor documentation



51621210
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
your function has a nested for-loop which iterates the intermediatelist every time where the outer loops is running
then you push a value with index i instead of index j but this should work only if the two for loops are not nested but chained



51622464
valgrind memcheck
Pattern(s): 5	
if now hdf5 really uses the standard allocators and valgrind cannot track what it does then file a bug on valgrind bugzilla
valgrind memcheck tool detects memory allocated released by the standard allocators such as malloc free new delete .



51629720
repa criterion
Pattern(s): 5	
so here is a slightly improved version frombytestring function and b representation in repa isn t particularly fast for some reason so there is a faster way to do it namely to construct an array by directly indexing the bytestring switching to sequential computation with repa.computeunboxeds will give you a factor of x2 slow down but since we are trying optimize it we need go all the way with parallel computation
not to steal all the thunder from a very nice repa library i d like to also show how all that would work with new massiv library just to present some concrete numbers showing the optimizations in action here is a stripped down criterion benchmarks benchmarking frombytestring massiv parallel time 1.114 ms 1.079 ms



51637376
avr microcontroller
Pattern(s): 5	
if the avr fuse bits that specify its clock source get corrupted and the avr expects you to connect an external clock or crystal but you do not have such a clock or crystal in your circuit then the avr will not have a clock signal and you be unable to program it
luckily there is actually a way to revive such avrs you can get another microcontroller to generate a pwm signal and apply it to the xtal2 or xtal1 pin of your avr as a low-speed clock signal 100 khz



51655354
public protected
Pattern(s): 5	
you can just make the property public and not worry about it
you can define public read access with protected write access



51663436
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
you generaly can render an arrays of components in react 16 something like this but you have bigger issues beside new_message never being called in that function your for-loop is not executing because when you evaluate it it looks like this so you never populate mes_for_show
also don t set state on every iteration of loops store new components in an arrays and when loops is done set new state



51665626
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
but if you want to use your existing folder as a local repo of an existing remote repo follow desktop desktop issue 2883 drag an ordinary folder into the app or use add local repository and choose the folder you ll get a message saying this directory does not appear to be a git repository
and the add repository folder is disabled click create a repository here select the repository - repository settings.



51672087
isnull nullif
Pattern(s): 5	
important your code is not showing any error because isnull is masking the error
also nullif is not a valid coldfusion function



51672846
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
error on sigma not being defined firefox was having no trouble displaying the graph -- google-chrome was
i ll need to look into why google-chrome is not working well with sigmajs



51709418
try-catch exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
your try-catch does not do anything different
never catch the unchecked exception-handling including the nullpointerexception



51736933
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 5	
this makes use of the ntfs journaling which applies to filesystems metadata not the contents of your files assuring that only one of two possibilities can happen either you have the old file entirely intact or else the new one also entirely intact
if power dies in the middle of making a change ntfs will use its journal to roll back the transaction



51749481
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
these two int do not compare equal
on the other hand the standard in basic.fundamental requires that all chars types occupy the same amount of storage and have the same alignment requirements



51757311
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
when i tried to load the json in firefox i did not get any fatal errors however opening it in google-chrome did
google-chrome also gave a reason and doing this from memory but it had to do with security issues my guess to help prevent potential xss



51781373
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 5	
a map is a key-value pair dictionary not a simple list array as you mentioned in your title
this is my assumption and i might be wrong but something that looks weird to me is this line this one gets via the key i and not by the i th position in the list because a map is not a list



51794348
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
option 2 the split apply combine way by way of a new function write a function that combines the row things there is a shorter way to do this but this makes your task explicit the reduce does the same thing as the for-loop repeatedly apply set_union and the lapply turns the matrix into a list of pairs also like a for-loop would
option 1 do nothing for loops aren t always the end of the world this doesn t look too bad if your matrices aren t enormous



51802000
multiplication modulo
Pattern(s): 5	
here multiplication done by summation
if modder 1e12 then your modulo not work



51804977
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want byte_1 to store the representation of any unsigned int you should make it more like 12 chars wide two chars is not enough to store the string 8000 so when sprintf writes to byte_1 those extra chars are most likely overwriting a
also note that the correct conversion specifier for an unsigned int is u not i



51849818
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
it looks like it just works in google-chrome because google-chrome doesn t support allow from
firefox does the right thing here but you can intercept this header like any other with the webrequest api specifically webrequest.onheadersreceived



51886455
gulp-sass node-sass
Pattern(s): 2	
we use gulp-sass to compile our css
from what i understand gulp-sass which uses node-sass have not provided any way to stop charset utf-8



51891479
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
in for-loop when run to continue the spaces will update but while loops would not this isn t because the continue behaves differently it s because for and while loops are different
the for-loop always executes the iteration_expression after each pass through the body and before evaluating the condition



51906731
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
int is one float is another
chars is not



51921008
virtualenv conda
Pattern(s): 5	
supposed i were to call pip freeze or pip list whether i m in a virtualenv or not wouldn t matter
it returns exactly the same list of packages from conda s corresponding site-packages folder



51978037
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
an alternative could be move the script tag outside of your for-loop then do something along the lines of
i don t have access to your arrays but try replacing with then replace the two instances of with that being said running the same script three times or however many times your loops iterates isn t very good practice



51980100
virtualenv conda
Pattern(s): 3	
and they sometimes need different python versions this can be done in conda but not virtualenv
virtualenv environment is usually for python developer



52045041
stringbuilder bufferedreader
Pattern(s): 5	
additionally you could benefit from using stringbuilder and not using with the built in method map.containskey x
scanner is used for parsing tokens from the contents of the stream while bufferedreader just reads the stream and does not do any special parsing



52058615
super self
Pattern(s): 3	
super does not alter the type of the self reference
super ... self .method will still pass in that self reference to the method being called so self is in all three cases the grandchild instance



52066134
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
so with buildkit if you do not have a copy command that includes back in your front image then that folder will not be included in the context without you needing to specify it in your .dockerignore file
there currently isn t a way to have two different .dockerignore files in the same directory that i m aware of



52078739
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
the if condition you added to fix your consecutive for-loop is exactly what the first nested loops do implicitly if not found do nothing
the root of your problem is that when is always false your nested loops behave correctly the inner for-loop is not executed but your consecutive for-loop will trigger a bug because the following for will be executed with a value of k equal to -1 since you say you initialize k with -1 and you will do an out-of-boud arrays access str -1



52082427
cpython pypy
Pattern(s): 1	
many things that are builtins in cpython are plain old python code in pypy
1 of course that isn t always an option pypy doesn t support 3.7 features yet there are a few third-party extension modules that are still way too slow to use it s harder to build yourself if you re on some uncommon platform so let s go back to cpython



52100049
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
just a side note a for-loop makes more sense in this case case rather than the for-each .
it s because the arrays is not being updated this is applicable to both code snippets neither is updating the arrays



52148514
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 1	
prebuilt distribution packages are only available one some of those architectures though all of centos debian fedora and ubuntu are available for 64bit x86 and ubuntu packages are available for all supported architectures
lists the supported architectures and 32-bit x86 linux isn t one of them



52151759
docx .doc
Pattern(s): 5	
the module docx seems not support encrypted files
the api in pywin32 can open a .doc or .docx file protected with password



52184548
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
setinterval doesn t play well with promises because it triggers a callback multiple times while promise resolves once
it seems that it s settimeout that fits the case



52192811
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
a block-level box is too wide for the containing block. this may happen when an element s width property has a value that causes the generated block box to spill over sides of the containing block
an element s height exceeds an explicit height assigned to the containing block the containing block s height is determined by the height property not by content height



52206580
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
in intellij right-click your test resources or test java resources directory select the mark directory as... sub-menu select test resources root this directory will appear with a decorator graphic symbolizing that it is in the classpath in eclipse go to run- run configurations... in case of debug run- debug configurations... open run debug configuration which you use open classpath tab select user entries and click advanced... on the right in the opened window select add folder point to your src test resources this folder will appear under user entries then you should move it up to make it the first on your classpath
depending on your ide it is possible that your resource directory is not in the classpath



52209618
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 1	
cron jobs do not only or particularly need absoute paths
the main differences compared to interactive shells is that cron jobs run with a different and more spare environment where the shell s path various library paths environment variables etc can be different or missing altogether



52231950
post get
Pattern(s): 2	
added on server side a route to accept also post to retrieve users data then added method post url new-url-for-post in table options
now it works but i still cannot understand why get is not working



52232370
printf feof
Pattern(s): 1	
for e.g also if is true then just wrinting printf is not enough you have to ask user to give correct command line input don t let user proceed further
it should be secondly read here why feof is wrong



52234222
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 1	
1 there is a special case though when you can register only an abstract class for the purposes of serializable deserialization not for kryo.copy though
this case is when your serializable is the same for all subclasses and during deserialization you can decide which subclass to return based on the data



52266773
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
your hadoop_conf_dir need to be spark s or hadoop s conf folder not the base folder from the spark extraction
this directory must contain core-site.xml yarn-site.xml hdfs-site.xml and hive-site.xml if using hivecontext then if yarn-site.xml is in the above location you don t need yarn_conf_dir but if you do set it it needs to be an actual directory not directly to the file



52282899
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 1	
quicksort is slow for lists mergesort is not in-place for arrays
short answer quicksort is advantageous for arrays in-place fast but not worst-case optimal



52284817
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
thus it is better to use a traditional for-loop with a numeric index when iterating over arrays because the for...in statement iterates over user-defined properties in addition to the arrays elements if you modify the arrays object such as adding custom properties or methods.
its best to use a for-loop not a for in when using with an arrays although it may be tempting to use this as a way to iterate over arrays elements the for...in statement will return the name of your user-defined properties in addition to the numeric indexes



52327928
tostring getter
Pattern(s): 5	
tostring is not considered an accessor since it doesn t access an attribute properties of the object but rather the object as a whole though i do see your point
accessors are getter usually named getsomething or issomething for boolean s and setters usually named setsomething



52331238
build.gradle dex
Pattern(s): 5	
you can also configure it directly in the corresponding build.gradle file read use java 8 language features
error error converting bytecode to dex cause dex cannot parse version 52 byte code



52347336
valgrind glibc
Pattern(s): 5	
doing that is needed to ensure that valgrind doesn t incorrectly report space leaks in glibc
the problem is that running __libc_freeres in older glibc versions causes this crash



52415907
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
notice calloc takes different parameters
malloc does not initialize the memory space you allocated it will often contain garbage from whatever that memory space was used for previously



52437827
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
assigning values to loops variable of the enhanced for-loop doesn t change the corresponding element of the arrays or iterable you are iterating over
your loops is equivalent to which clearly doesn t update the values in the arrays



52438891
d3.js highcharts
Pattern(s): 5	
chart plug-ins like echarts highcharts antv d3.js learning some program is very important the common language is js often used in designing front-end web page
when you are developing a product these open-source visual plug-ins may be integrated highcharts is not open source . ready-made chart and bi tools



52448317
strlen realloc
Pattern(s): 1	
this is because strlen does not include the string termination
so your realloc is wrong



52450879
pull push
Pattern(s): 5	
using git pull means run git fetch then run git merge
that s an extra step that git push does not and cannot do



52451714
folder dir
Pattern(s): 3	
the subroutine renamefile is never executed if the specified folder does not exist or is currently not accessible
fourth solution the folder path is used on command dir and passed together with the file name to the subroutine which works mainly just with name of file without path this works also with a unc path



52451714
folder dir
Pattern(s): 3	
fourth solution the folder path is used on command dir and passed together with the file name to the subroutine which works mainly just with name of file without path this works also with a unc path
the subroutine renamefile is never executed if the specified folder does not exist or is currently not accessible



52451714
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
the subroutine renamefile is never executed if the specified folder does not exist or is currently not accessible
fifth solution the folder path is used on command dir which is executed with option s to search also in subdirectories of specified directory resulting in output of name of files with full path



52455413
valgrind memcheck
Pattern(s): 5	
valgrind will tell you only approximate location of uninitialised values origin in terms of valgrind but not exact variable name
see valgrind manual for --track-origins when set to yes memcheck keeps track of the origins of all uninitialised values



52488426
gunicorn daphne
Pattern(s): 5	
now looks your problem is with production and gunicorn couldn t handle both requests so daphne comes to play
a bf way to solve it is to start the daphne asgi within another file which contains- exec daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8001 django_asgi_module application note the different port used here other parts of the two files should be quite similar



52500865
boost allocator
Pattern(s): 5	
you can almost achieve the desired effect of 1 memory allocator using boost transform_iterator instead of std transform with std back_inserter
the problem though is that because boost transform_iterator cannot return a reference to an element it is tagged as std input_iterator_tag



52516793
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 3	
i was having similar issue with keras cannot import abs
tried updating and found tensorflow file was still in use



52542927
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
still the for-loop is clearly slower
because a comprehension dictionary set list comprehensions or a generator expression is under the hood implemented as a new function and calling that function has a base cost the plain loops doesn t have to pay



52543712
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
d takes an int not a size_t should be zu
g takes a double not a long double should be lg



52550323
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
correct syntax is whether you can use a for-loop or not depends on how your std_logic_vectors are provided
if you take them from another arrays or a concatenated std_logic_vector you can use a loops



52582519
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
stick to consistent quoting and you should be ok create table trade prodid int references product productid transid int references transaction transactionid quantitypurchased int not null primary key transid prodid -- here ----- ------- -- ------
using double quotes makes an identifier in this case a column name case-sensitive



52584065
rsa aes
Pattern(s): 1	
rsa is not a replacement of aes nor the other way
aes is a symmetrical algorithm and rsa is any asymmetric one



52618806
clickhouse mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
clickhouse doesn t support writing to odbc tables yet
mysql has this functionality



52674654
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 2	
the reason you cannot build the plugin with mvn install is because you have configured maven to expect the plugin to already be built
this section belongs in a different pom.xml file not the plugin pom.xml file



52675909
nsbitmapimagerep nsimage
Pattern(s): 1	
that digression past us an nsbitmapimagerep is a much more concrete object
an nsimage does not have pixels an nsbitmapimagerep does



52675909
nsbitmapimagerep nsimage
Pattern(s): 5	
an nsimage does not have pixels an nsbitmapimagerep does
an nsbitmapimagerep is a chunk of data together with pixel format information and colorspace information that allows us to interpret the data as a rectangular array of color values



52678199
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
that for-loop was crafted by a talented hacker
it s much more elegant than much of the rest of the code s approach to iterating through a loops what i wouldn t give for comments though



52690286
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
so to fix this either make min and max be double or leave them be int decreasing accuracy and print them as what there are namely int printf minimum d nmaximum d n min max
printing an int using a conversion specifier for double is not a good idea but invokes the infamous undefined behaviour



52690906
spaces delimiter
Pattern(s): 1	
with -escaping but spaces moved to previous line c program files test.bat becomes c program files test.bat but the command line reports c program is not recognized.
this is because with the spaces character on the first line and the character -escaped the is interpreted as a delimiter and not as a character



52710390
installation upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
i find msi s per-user installation constructs not ideal
it relates to poor serviceability upgrade patching etc... and a number of other details



52710960
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
however functions like realloc do not have this property as they can return a pointer to storage containing pointers
as you pointed out yourself nonnull and malloc are just macros



52713781
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
so if the slowdown ends up being in your for-loop here are a few things you can try python might be computing loops condition every iteration for i in range int n - 4 2 + 1 calculate int n - 4 2 + 1 once before loops
don t recalculate stuff inside the loops that doesn t change



52714644
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
by the looks of it you want to get a list of directory containing a single _ and then every .jpg file inside those folder appending it to a text file
this is pretty simple there are a few issues in your code the usage of -name here returns only the folder name not the full path



52728780
qgraphicsview qgraphicsitem
Pattern(s): 1	
for example you say that you want to have a moveable rectangle because that task is simple is qgraphicsview it is not necessary to overwrite if you want to change the way you paint the rectangle you must overwrite the paint method as shown below update
first of all a qgraphicsitem is not a qwidget so it has those events and does not handle them directly that s what qgraphicsview and qgraphicsscene do



52750230
clang llvm
Pattern(s): 5	
debug information is best effort but if you haven t run any other transforms since clang emitted the ir then it will usually work
this is an intentional design decision llvm normally shouldn t be treating system and non-system functions differently



52795413
button checkbox
Pattern(s): 3	
the following code will work in cart page for your privacy policy checkbox using mandatory jquery code to make it work as proceed to checkout button is just linked to checkout page without submitting any data
the code will disable the button on start it use sweet alert 2 js message to display an error message on button click when the checkbox is not checked the complete code code goes in function.php file of your active child theme or active theme



52811283
grafana metrics
Pattern(s): 5	
if cadvisor is able to get required metrics then configure cadvisor storage plugin influxdb is a good start and visualize them in the grafana
grafana doesn t collect and store any data



52815920
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
because your for-loop doesn t bind your newly defined variable data to the objects within your
you are redefining data within each loops without changing train or test



52886580
waitpid posix
Pattern(s): 5	
see posix waitpid which documents wait too
and most unix-based systems also provide a wcoredump too but posix does not mandate it



52894109
integer fractions
Pattern(s): 3	
therefore the fractions will be more accurate since the denominator can be any integer not only powers of 2
floating point numbers are already rational numbers so the conversion to the fractions type comes directly from the underlying representation of the float



52896228
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
1 size_type is nothing more than an unsigned int which is commonly used as a type for sizes since an unsigned int cannot have a negative value except zero 0 being a plus-minus number which is still allowed.
2 is obviously since the string is a std string a string buffer of chars alternatively wchar_t or unsigned short instead of chars for wide string std wstring .



52934758
children parent
Pattern(s): 3	
zombies are not the only possible cause for this problem -- stopped children may not be reported for a variety of reasons
the existence of a zombie typically means that the parent has not properly waited on them



52961588
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
but unlike encryption algorithms password hash are one-way deterministic trap door calculations
also unlike secret-key encryption the salt does not need to remain secret



52979274
hex binary
Pattern(s): 5	
hex is a text serialization format for binary integers
the value in is a 32-bit binary number not hex or decimal



52998857
post get
Pattern(s): 3	
app config security.yml security encoders appbundle entity security algorithm bcrypt src appbundle controller securitycontroller.php form view javascript submit function side note should be obvious but you should use post and not get with your ajax query
first because get parameters are as clear as day.



53007450
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
a common pattern for a server handling connections might be the for-loop is necessary to read multiple lines of data from the connection
if the handleclient can read the input all in one chunk then a loops isn t necessary so yes you are right the for is not always necessary but it depends what data is being read



53053775
pandas dask
Pattern(s): 1	
it lets you use most of the standard pandas commands in parallel out-of-memory
the only problem is dask doesn t have an excel reader from what i can tell



53062101
cpython pypy
Pattern(s): 5	
for example pypy does jit compilations cpython does some low-level tricks
no python cpython does not do variable inlining reason for this is that you can run your script with python -i non-optimized.py and you should be able to reach all vars



53114125
width height
Pattern(s): 5	
but when it comes to height divs don t have height by default so here set height or min-height to your required value and add max-height 100 optional a block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available stretches out to the left and right as far as it can reference
it is always recommended to mention height to the parent grandparent before you use height 100 to a child element try this if you still don t want to mention height to the body element parent you can define them like this because by default the div elements were block elements block elements always have 100 width but not a definite height so define the max-width the actual size and set its width to 100 so that it won t escape the given width



53155981
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
from significant digits and largest int by length for sas variables under windows | length | largest int | exponential | bytes | represented exactly | notation +---------+-----------------------+------------ | 3 | 8 192 | 2 13 | 4 | 2 097 152 | 2 21 | 5 | 536 870 912 | 2 29 | 6 | 137 438 953 472 | 2 37 | 7 | 35 184 372 088 832 | 2 45 | 8 | 9 007 199 254 740 992 | 2 53 so while all 16-digit hex values in c can fit distinctly in a 64-bit int not all such can distinctly fit in sas numeric those
the 64-bit double however is ieee standard and can deal with numbers up to 10 51 albeit with some loss of precision



53186248
ckeditor summernote
Pattern(s): 3	
we had no choice but to change to ckeditor which is working really well for our needs
after much research it seems because summernote does not reside within it s own iframe any css included within will naturally propogate to the surrounding page



53231144
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 1	
for example firefox does not expose anything about its windows through the accessibility api
with safari i was able to find the url but it was a bit buried within the ui element hierarchy



53239472
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 5	
it appears that keras doesn t seem to suit the needs of deepmind
so deepmind came up with sonnet a high-level object oriented programming library built on top of tensorflow to address its research needs



53241259
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
this is because the async for-loop ensures the async generator cleanup on loops exhaustion
the question is what happens when loops is not exhausted here gen got out of scope but the cleanup simply didn t occur



53266790
base-class derived-class
Pattern(s): 3	
neither the d1 nor the d2 object can exist until after the base-class subobject has been successfully created
this means that during creation of the base-class subobject the derived-class object cannot yet exist and likewise the dynamic type of your base-class object cannot yet be the derived type



53355454
min max
Pattern(s): 5	
suppose i sampled n numbers d i from dirichlet and then map them to min...max interval x i min + d i max-min then i sum them all using property that all d i sums to 1 sum n min + max - min n-1 min + max if sum is fixed then it mean we have to redefine maximum value - lets call it sampling max s
so sampling procedure would be as following - sample n 0...1 numbers from dirichlet map them to min...max s interval and check if any of those numbers are below desired max original not redefined



53367465
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 3	
example 1 - simple remote command in this example we send a simple whoami command we re telling sudo not to issue a prompt and to take its input from stdin
this makes the sudo passwd passing completely silent so the only response you get back is the output from whoami



53378725
debian centos
Pattern(s): 3	
for example the openjdk 11 on debian is still in buster testing and sid unstable and therefore not available in any stable branch
i guess in centos i am not that familiar with it tbh. it s the same situation



53385856
strtol atoi
Pattern(s): 5	
or 3 tokenizing the string with strtok and then using strtol as atoi should not be used as it provides absolutely zero error checking
there really isn t any need to use both strtok and strtol as strtol already provides a way to advance past the digits converted



53401399
persistent transient
Pattern(s): 3	
the second case the operation is persistent not merge therefore not cascaded
the persistent context sees contacttype as transient and cannot go further with the persistent because one of the dependencies is in transient state



53407221
ssl https
Pattern(s): 2	
it should be noted that you must use ssl to send the request
https not http in the following string here is where i put my api key and now my application works like it did before i needed the key



53417718
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to keep the data you need to export it in some flat files because once attached to newer server versioning a database is upgrade and cannot be attached to an older one
even restoring a backup made with newer versioning is not possible



53431222
width height
Pattern(s): 3	
also it just has width and not height
another thing to point out here is that since you re using you can use the width and the height attributes right there instead of creating another or attribute binding



53468886
erlang elixir
Pattern(s): 3	
erlang and hence elixir is a dynamically typed language and you might want to have different clauses for different types passed an error message if the types do not conform or just sink the input out or whatever
erlang does not take out the liberty to deal with not proper input in the way you need that is why guards you use is the way to go



53509483
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 1	
current systemd uptime is available and i d expect the software watchdog -- the daemons -- to be able to handle changes with the wall-clock time without reboot the systemd
first off the watchdog daemons shouldn t be updating the systemd time ever and that would include prior to causing the systemd to reboot



53525565
xslt schematron
Pattern(s): 5	
the resulting modified xslt that i ll leave to you to turn back into schematron is
as this is a schematron question it might have been clearer if you d posted the schematron not the xslt that gets generated from the schematron



53538520
onclick onchange
Pattern(s): 5	
you need to assign the click event to card like check this answer for more details applying classname onclick onchange not working on custom react component in general if you need to pass on all the props passed from parents you can use the following syntax destructuring all the props would ensure that the props are passed and this you won t need to do it manually for each prop
onclick needs a function the way you are using it you are assigining the returned value of imageselected to onclick which isn t a function and thus on every render it is executed



53548641
mouseover mouseleave
Pattern(s): 5	
try this instead or to make use of jquery to reduce code you could simply do this mouseover will cause this to fire every time the mouse moves one pixel over the element so this could result in rapid flashing you may want to use the mouseenter and mouseleave to have better control over this behavior
the problem is that you are assigning the result of the function to the mouseover event not the function itself



53566134
dns spf
Pattern(s): 5	
with content distribution networks load balancing the ehlo name and ip reverse dns often don t match
you could check the ip s validity against spf records not every domain has spf records but it is quite common



53577460
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
as written your code says if this folder does not exist make the directory and copy the file
if the directory exists it never gets to the copy the file part



53581817
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
0 is a 32-bit int you want 0d for 64-bit double s
you want to define transformtree for double not for an arbitrary type bound to type variable called double



53588636
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
the else clause of a for-loop is triggered any time loops completes normally rather than through a break statement
since your loops does not contain a break the else will always be triggered



53659983
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
your code not only allocate memory for arrays of pointers the blue arrays but in the for-loop you also allocate memory for the red arrays as well
so free arrays line alone will just free the memory allocated by the blue arrays but not the red ones



53665298
terraform packer
Pattern(s): 1	
i m not sure how packer is necessary alongside terraform sense it seems to me that terraform has the same exact built-in functionality
a big difference is that terraform doesn t handle the lifecycle of creating a ami



53688155
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
this is because the .htaccess file is disabling directory listing withing public folder for your second problem which is you are unable to visit laravel index page links this is because laravel rewrite url rules are not working and to enable them you sould enable apache2 rewrite module as follow sudo a2enmod rewrite then restart your webserver sudo systemctl restart apache2 now your problem should be fixed
for your first problem the public folder is not showing but you can visit it



53692409
post put
Pattern(s): 3	
unprofessionally i myself use all post and get alone so i dont have to deal with put and delete my workaround and on ajax call and the route
you have used post instead of put i am not sure if put is used in ajax as well but u could try that if that alone fails



53718488
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
if we take a look at this so post we can see what unsigned values actually means quoting what pubby has said in the so post i just linked above we can understand a signed integer can represent negative numbers
unsigned cannot



53784817
alexa amazon
Pattern(s): 5	
alexa isn t alexa without skills and avs essentially just allows alexa to work on devices that amazon didn t create
once you create your third-party alexa-enabled device choose the best option from that documentation to allow users to authenticate with their amazon account allowing access to the skills they have chosen to enable



53788026
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome ignores the writing mode of the cells firefox doesn t give the cells enough height and edge makes the rotated table super tall
css allows this but none of edge firefox or google-chrome does it right



53800654
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
that is the purpose of the while loop within that code block once you have a good int value recall that endptr will be set to the next chars after the last digit converted
a quick check whether is not the nul-terminating chars and not the line-ending will tell you whether charters remain that are available for conversion



53821167
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 5	
a better solution would be using this batch file the command for runs in a separate command process with cmd.exe c more precisely compspec c in background the command line dir outputs to handle stdout of started command process in bare format because of option b the file names with extension and with full path because of option s of all only non-hidden files because of option a-d-h attribute not directory and not hidden with file name index.js found in specified directory or any subdirectory because of option s
the error message output by dir to handle stderr on not finding anything matching these criteria is suppressed by redirecting to device nul



53876265
oncreate onstart
Pattern(s): 1	
you should be setting your content view in oncreate not onstart
onstart can be invoked multiple times for the same activity instance



53896834
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
concrete parent with concrete children multi-table inheritance the parent class has a database table with its own fields and each child class has its own table with its own fields and a foreign-key as primary-key to the parent table. this looks like class table inheritance in the database
concrete parent with proxy children proxy models the parent class has a database table but the children do not . instead the child classes interact directly with the parent table. now if we add all the fields from the children as defined in our data-model to the parent class this could be interpreted as an implementation of single table inheritance . the proxy models provide a convenient way of dealing with the application side of the single large database table



53904304
ord chr
Pattern(s): 1	
however your other attempt map c str.upper chr ord is equivalent to map c lambda x ord chr str.upper c and ord chr x simply isn t defined
chr cannot take a string as an argument



53918670
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
if at some point you need to talk to a subclassing in a way that the superclass would not understand or cause an error needing to use instanceof then what you need is a different class not a subclassing
try to find ways to use inherited and polymorphism instead say for example in your base class you can have a method called performmainjob and using polymorphism you would define that to be a call to a method solveproblem for an engineer subclassing and a call to a method verifybooks for an accountant subclassing



53924449
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 3	
your loop continues while but an unsigned integer is always greater than or equal to zero
unsigned integers cannot be negative so your loop never terminates



53975258
strdup malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
note that strdup is not part of the c standard
the newemployee function return type is but you are not returning anything from this function if the malloc is successful



53982467
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 2	
you can see this in action here you can change setinterval to be settimeout and you will get the exact same behaviour
settimeout is not a persistent clock but it doesn t matter since they both get cleaned up anyways

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
for instance is virtually the same as the for-loop itself doesn t add any significant overhead to the cpu
although you would probably want to write a single loops anyway if your code readability is improved when you do two loops go ahead and do it



54058208
jlabel jlayeredpane
Pattern(s): 5	
not wrapping the jlabel unnecessarily in another component thus the mouse listeners would be added directly on the jlabel and not on a wrapper object
not changing the jlayeredpane s default and unique layout explicitly removing the old components before adding new ones calling repaint on the jlayeredpane after adding or removing components



54073784
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
assuming a scenario each loops runs up to n so we can say complexity of each for-loop is o n as each loops will run n times
so you specified these loops are not nested in a linear scenario for first loops o n + second loops o n + third loops o n which will give you 3o n . now as we are mostly concentrating on variable part of the complexity we will exclude constant part and will say it s o n for this scenario. but in practical scenario i will suggest you to keep in mind constant will also play a vital role so never exclude them. for example consider time complexity to find smallest integer from an integer arrays any one will say it s o n but to find second largest or smallest of the same arrays will be o 2n

fgets strcmp
Pattern(s): 5	
other issues concerning comparing files not covered in answers yet file data with 0 should a file contain a null character fgets will read that character like any other non-end-of-line character
then a following strcmp will not compare all the line that was read

Pattern(s): 1	
these provide a first-class programming environment and thrust provides easy-to-use parallel primitives as does tbb
no tbb is not supported for nvidia gpus



54136723
scylla cassandra
Pattern(s): 1	
scylla considered such an implementation but hasn t implemented it either see
there is a reason why cassandra doesn t support the feature you describe - it s because it can be inefficient first the secondary-index must indeed list as you noted all the matching row keys and not just distinct matching partition keys

folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to copy the folder specify the target as the folder you want to create copy .git . .git
you copied the contents of the .git folder into the dist directory not the .git folder itself

google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 3	
your example would then remain the same only for the fieldset selector you have the following css properties edit flexbox on element is supported only on firefox 64+ not yet supported on google-chrome
i found this after posting and testing to see if it works in google-chrome as i tested it only on firefox before posting



54183894
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
count with innodb is slower than count id because innodb doesn t cache the row count
on the other hand with myisam count query would be faster and return result in no time because myisam maintains the count of rows

Pattern(s): 1	
requisites qdbus klipper xargs bash create a bash executable foo.sh
note this needs to be bash as tcsh does not support multi-line arguments



54211053
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
just remove the following line from your for-loop and the code should work fine declaring these variables inside the for-loop is creating new variables which have their scope limited to the for-loop only
hence when you execute the following statement inside the for-loop it s actually initializing the pointer ptr declared inside loops and not the one declared outside loops



54243178
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
first create a int64_t object initialise to zero get length of the string check that it fits copy the bytes of the chars sequence onto the int as long as the int type doesn t have trap representations the behaviour is well defined and the generated int will be the same across compiler versions as long as the cpu endianness and negative number representation remains the same
reading the chars string back doesn t require copying because chars is exceptionally allowed to alias all other types note the qualification in the last section



54263267
unsigned short
Pattern(s): 3	
when in a math operation you put together a signed type with a unsigned type and the unsigned type doesn t have a lower rank the signed typed will get converted to the unsigned type see 6.3.1.8 usual arithmetic conversions i m linking to the c standard but rules for int arithmetic are foundational and need to be common to both languages
in other words assuming that size_t isn t unsigned chars or unsigned short it s usually unsigned long and the c standard recommends it shouldn t be unsigned long long unless necessary size_t 0 - 1 gets implicitly translated to size_t 0 - size_t 1 which is a positive number equal to size_max -1 cannot be represented in an unsigned type so it gets converted converted by formally repeatedly adding or subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type until the value is in the range of the new type 6.3.1.3p



54290945
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
your for-loop is equivalent to as you can see it increments after printing and your while increments before printing
all numbers are larger by one in the second loops not just the last

yacc bison
Pattern(s): 5	
you must have by now found your answer but for anyone else who might stumble upon this post about morpha you can download morpha directly from but this requires flex to be installed first decompressed and compiled i m using the linux terminal command line below tar -xzf flex-for-morph.tar.gz then change the current working directory to flex and make it . configure make if the make command gives the following error make yacc command not found makefile 105 recipe for target parse.c failed make parse.c error 127 it means it cannot get yacc
so you need to install bison via command line sudo apt-get install bison now run the make command again it should give you something similar to this at the last line gcc -g -o -o flex ccl.o dfa.o ecs.o gen.o main.o misc.o nfa.o parse.o scan.o skel.o sym.o tblcmp.o yylex.o libfl.a now you re good to compile morpha which you downloaded from above link .. flex-2.5.4 flex -i -cfe -8 -omorpha.yy.c morpha.lex gcc -o morpha morpha.yy.c morpha takes the already-pos-tagged files as input

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
simply change your second main for-loop to start from d-1 here is the code
if you notice your code the second for-loop is starting from i d in but your first loops is not ending at d you are doing i d there which will stop before d so it will go from 1 to 5 if your d value is 6



54330498
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem is with the for-loop and calling the promise inside this loops
loops doesn t wait for the promise to be fully resolved

html2canvas jspdf
Pattern(s): 5	
according to one gihtub issue there is problem when using images with html2canvas here is the link to that issue use that to modify addhtml function or try using jspdf the way it is meant to be used and add image like this
jspdf does not support adding image the way you are trying to add it because addthtml function uses html2canvas module to convert your html to canvas so jspdf can render it into pdf



54386306
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
the possible reasons for using chacha20-poly1305 which is a stream cipher based authenticated encryption algorithm over aes-gcm which is an authenticated block cipher algorithm are chacha20-poly1305 is almost 3 times faster than aes when the cpu does not provide dedicated aes instructions
intel processors provide aes-ni instruction set 1 chacha20-poly1305 does not need the nonce to be unpredictable random unlike the iv of aes-gcm



54395371
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
to answer your other questions the parent automatically propagates all state changes to all children that care for it all child components are independent of the parent eg if they have their own states the parent doesn t care
it s only when they share a state and a state update function that this becomes relevant so only if you specifically pass such function to the children if the children share a state then it should be lift up which is explained in the doc linked



54396537
ciimage uiimage
Pattern(s): 5	
you need to use the ciimage created on top from the current image as below
you are using uiimage instead of ciimage in combinedparameters and uiimage doesn t have extent method so you are getting the crash



54405126
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
to receive a vector with all values in the end insert this line in the beginning before the outer for-loop then in every inner for-loop add this line hist.append id now you ll have all values available after you re done with the loops and can print them or do whatever you like with them
you need to put at the end of every inner for-loop but still inside of loops so not on the same line as the for that it gets printed for every single iteration



54419034
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
nginx apache are general purpose web servers
apache does not know how to serve rack applications and puma doesn t know how to do a bunch of other things nginx apache do cgi scripts url rewriting proxies balancing blacklisting... rack is a library for ruby that accepts parsed http requests from an app server funnels them through a configurable stack of middleware such as session handling passing the request object to a handler and returning the response object the app server making web development in ruby easy



54419917
stardog graphdb

Pattern(s): 5	
the fact that udp isn t connection-oriented is irrelevant
sure tcp has the concept of sessions but both have port numbers and that s really all the nat needs



54436501
ciimage uiimage
Pattern(s): 1	
update in case if you are fatalerror means uiimage doesn t exists with ciimage so you need to convert uiimage to ciimage
let s say your scaledimage is an uiimage so you can directly get an ciimage without creating a new one

because soapui takes more than a second to respond the jmeter requests are held open for this time
if the jmeter thread pool for requests is exhausted all threads are waiting for an answer from soapui it cannot further scale



54459158
alexa amazon
Pattern(s): 1	
there were some updates to the alexa interaction model so the dialogflow alexa importer doesn t seem to work anymore
there are a few things to consider when porting an alexa model into a dialogflow agent built-in intents you need to create custom dialogflow intents for built-in alexa intents like amazon.helpintent built-in slots amazon offers a large variety of slots amazon.number that need to be converted to dialogflow



54528926
perl tcl
Pattern(s): 5	
in perl empty elements are undef so i guess the closest translation to perl would be test output
the tcl syntax isn t clear so i went to the source tclsh tcl foreach values in each list are used in order from first to last and each value is used exactly once

Pattern(s): 3	
pandas does not support this
dask arrays are mostly api compatible with pandas and support parallel execution for apply



54575330
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 3	
the problem is that if the input arrays is length 0 the for-loop never runs and so you have no return statement
that way if the check is successful the last recursive call is run on an empty arrays and doesn t return anything so you get an answer of none

54604780
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
that said not all conversions preserve value a conversion from signed int to unsigned int doesn t preserve negative values however they are converted in a well-defined manner and that may be surprising evaluates to 1 which seems absurd to anyone knowing a bit of math especially to the ones new to the language
. if one inspects the standard c library functions they ll find that values of type chars are almost



54614957
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 1	
i guess that is because stdout is buffered while stderr is not or not so much
so stderr get s fflush after the line agent no process killed is streamed while stdout is fflush after the script . somescript.sh exists

the suggestion add-to-list ac-modes org-mode did not work and i was unable to find ac-flyspell-workaround



54626863
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	
another way around this is to not set the property value in the constructor but instead to define the property with a getter and a setter in fact in this case a setter is not needed as a read only value is helpful
as we are using a getter this is not a normal property and is not set in the constructor



54628350
scikit-learn xgboost
Pattern(s): 5	
but the scikit-learn wrapper for xgboost doesn t have that parameter. so if you want to go for incremental training you might have to switch to the official api version of xgboost
i don t think the scikit-learn wrapper has an option to incrementally train a model

migradoc uses pdfsharp to create the pdf and thus you can use pdfsharp for modifications without adding an additional tool to the process
i m afraid migradoc cannot rotate the image



54677305
luis bots
Pattern(s): 5	
dispatch feature provided for luis is language dependant as you mentioned because luis is language dependant
the best way to handle this case is to detect the language on your bots side not on luis side and then call the right luis model given the detected language



54681411

54682137
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 5	
marklogic returns the value of the last expression but the for-loop doesn t return a value
what you want to do is declare an arrays variable before loops add to it during loops then return that variable



54689980
hide show
Pattern(s): 5	
the part that show hide isn t in any particular element. which means there s no way to implement a media-query override that says if the screen is big enough show this all the time
so it doesn t replace all your show hide navigation widgets



54702514
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
regardless it seems that i would need to be more cognizant of how rstudio establishes a folder which retains its initial settings
an adaptation to the email i sent my colleagues that were assisting me with a similar issue to review i was unable to open any files through rstudio because rstudio returned error messages indicating either that the file itself or the work directory did not exist

ntlm does not do this



54734843
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
an alternative method to access the child component as early as possible is to associate the contentchild decorator to a getter setter property and to set the child flag in the setter see this stackblitz for a demo
please note that the private variable _child and the getter are not needed to set the flag



54734864

int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
there are ways around that if reading directly into int is not a requirement
for example you can read into a chars buffer string and then check if the input was numeric and if it will fit into an int



54893184
strncpy malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
also the strncpy function doesn t always null terminate the destination string and malloc returns uninitialized memory so atoi will can read past the end of allocated memory when it reads the strings
you can fix this by using calloc instead of malloc which returns memory initialized to all 0 s

children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
you need to do things to parent after iterating children not during doing it
get children for each parent they have not whole .kb-item elements



54909764
portrait landscape
Pattern(s): 1	
this happens because portrait image doesn t have an info about its orientation at conversion stage and thus an image in portrait remains in portrait mode even though it s converted to ciimage or cgimage
to fix this you should compare standard landscape s width height with a non-standard portrait s width height and if these values are different rotate an image to 180 degrees cw or apply orientation case .portraitupsidedown

folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
fastest way make a folder directory named raw under the res folder directory and put files of your desired like mp3 images etc it will be included to the final apk file as raw resource
you can also put some png images to drawable folder but not sure it would work in release mode latest version of android studio may give you error while generating signed apk if the size of files is too large not recommended increase your code base like increasing size of java files adding more number of lines to your xml files etc

if you care about why we ve made the design decision in circe not to expose the constructors you can skip to the end of this answer but this kind of question comes up a lot so i also want to address a few related points first
a side note about naming note that the use of the name fold for this method is inherited from argonaut and is arguably inaccurate

queue fifo
Pattern(s): 1	
my mistake was to think that the queue proxy is not iterable because it is the proxy
however the proxy works fine in place of the actual queue if put get are used also a fifo queue cannot be closed and does not have a natural end which i found annoying because it means one has to send around special end of queue entries but not too many of them to not unintentionally block the queue

spaces delimiter
Pattern(s): 3	
you want that at the start instead of the spaces stuff is only removing the first character of the entirety of the xml not the first character of every delimiter item created within the xml
char 13 is your delimiter here not a whitespace so put char 13 at the start instead

filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 5	
even if the ntfs wikipedia page mentions the guid ebd0a0a2-b9e5-4433-87c0-68b6b72699c7 for ntfs in the gpt case this guid is in fact unrelated to filesystems see comment below about this
it s probably easier to use getvolumeinformation instead and just compare if the result is the ntfs string as in the other answer in my particular case i initially wanted to test if a volume is ntfs or not before attempting an indexing with deviceiocontrol hvol fsctl_enum_usn_data ... because i thought such mft querying would be limited to ntfs volumes

Pattern(s): 5	
your getter setter doesn t follow standard java bean naming conventions and thus spring is not able to find getter for coursecode
getter should be getcoursecode not getcoursecode



55389998

swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
if i m correct the next lines read like put the outcome of in a new array named nameofarray if you know swift and not objective-c you may be thinking that arrays are value types so an assignment from one array into a var creates a new array
however in objective-c arrays are reference types and assignment of an value doesn t create a new array it just copies a reference to an existing array



55433519
nvda voiceover
Pattern(s): 5	
using a semantic tag is good too although support for navigating directly to an article tag is only supported in some screen readers jaws and voiceover but not nvda
if you have a snippet of the article and end with ellipses and a read more type link make sure the read more has additional contextual information such as the element helps some screen readers voiceover will announce it but nvda won t but i wouldn t recommend hiding information in a time element



55442132
testng qaf
Pattern(s): 1	
you can also take a look to gherkin with qaf which is pure testng implementation for gherkin
it is using testng not cucumber runner and provides you all the features of testng including parallel execution listeners grouping priority etc.



55450172
range min
Pattern(s): 1	
however that should not stop you from being able to define range that would include any value or that they are open in one end they have a min but not a max or viceversa
for example if the range is to be specified as two arguments in the signature of the method that is going to use such a range then you can simply designate the null as to indicate that that min or max does not exist that is that end of the range is open



55478020
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
the broadcast is done by keeping a list of all the connected clients and their file descriptors updated and by iterating through it to send each client the message you can t do a broadcast in tcp as you would in udp because tcp is a connected protocol while udp isn t
if it can be of any use here is a repo with a multi-user tcp server i made in c for a school project



55479202
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 5	
i was able to get cron jobs working by touch home ubuntu crontest.log to create a log file sudo vim etc crontab which edits the system-wide crontab add your own cron job on the second to last line using the root user such as which dumps stdout and stderr into the logfile you created in step 1 verify it is working by waiting 1 minute and then cat home ubuntu crontest.log to see the output of the cron job
on aws ubuntu ec2 machines cron jobs cannot be edited or made to run by using crontab -e or even sudo crontab -e for whatever reason



55556975
filesystems btrfs
Pattern(s): 1	
the clever way is simply mount the partition on mnt like mount dev sda1 mnt this mounts it read-write and you just edit mnt etc fstab to change the new uuid for your partition which you can get from either blkid or ls -lha dev disk by-uuid however the readonly filesystems will not see your changes so you think you ve failed
you ll look at etc fstab and it will appear unchanged at least under btrfs it looks unchanged



55625695
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 2	
or use for-loop to iterate all values from arraylist
your response is an arrays not an object



55635440
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
since the value of the string is not an int but a floating point number we have to parse it as a double first
but to convert a string to the primitive double is not possible so we have to use the wrapper class double for this



55647144
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
here s a comment now deleted i made to another answer which turns out to not be strictly speaking accurate i checked the glibc source for the default gnu linux malloc library and verified that calloc does not normally manually clear memory which has just been mmap d
and malloc doesn t touch the memory at all



55662565
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
go to root project cd android . gradlew clean in root folder run following command if there was index.js file react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android app src main assets index.android.bundle --assets-dest android app src main res if there are two files index.android.js and index.ios.js then run react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.android.js --bundle-output android app src main assets index.android.bundle --assets-dest android app src main res above two are single line commands
go to your project folder android app src main assets delete index.android.bundle and index.android.bundle.meta if assets directory not there create new one



55679355
ienumerable iqueryable
Pattern(s): 5	
an ienumerable object has everything in it to enumerate over all the elements you can ask for the first element of the sequence and once you ve got an element you can ask for the next element until there are no more elements
an iqueryable seems similar however the iqueryable does not hold everything to enumerate the sequence



55679542
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 3	
as a side note if you are validating any kind of input you have to make sure that you also validate it on the server-side and not only client-side validation
client-side validation is just for ux and can be easily escaped



55716229
salt md5
Pattern(s): 3	
so i will write it partly as pseudo code note that i m merging the password bytes and the salt bytes not the password string and the salt string
then the md5 it taken only once from these merged bytes



55755136
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 5	
in general systemd doesn t send a message to your daemons
your daemons should generate the status notifications every time the internal status changes



55770006
std ostream
Pattern(s): 5	
you cannot use since std ostream does not have a copy constructor
even if std ostream had a copy constructor using the above interface would cause the following problems



55782360
content-length content-type
Pattern(s): 1	
charset utf-8 host graph.microsoft.com content-length 111 expect 100-continue connection keep-alive odata.type microsoft.graph.opentypeextension extensionname com.test.nickname date openextension
content-type was not specified and it was going as text



55785822
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 1	
see this running in an online interpreter at advice re best-practice usage prompts are conventionally written to stderr on unix so for prompting-related purposes retaining the original stdout isn t generally called for
prompting on stderr is what read -p does



55858093
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
execution order in maven is based on two components first the lifecycle phase to which the execution is bound for executions bound to the same phase the ordering in the pom.xml takes precedence
maven doesn t allow the same plugin to be configured twice so it s not possible to move the docker stop execution below spring



55919559
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
also more information focusing on the differences between having and where is located in this piece of information i build a sample of your database in sqlfiddle for completeness reasons the sample database is build like that create table table_choice field_choiceid int unsigned not null primary key field_choicename varchar 2 chars set utf8 collate utf8_unicode_ci field_choicemaximumslot int unsigned null
create table table_select field_selectedid int unsigned not null primary key auto_increment field_selectedchoice int unsigned not null foreign key fk_select field_selectedchoice references table_choice field_choiceid on delete cascade on update cascade



55929508
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
so the productviewmodel can stay the same but then we introduce a simple orderedproductviewmodel to represent the ordered products when calling order the concept of a cart is strictly client-side but if we do have a cart model that exists server-side just not an entity so the product list still returns a collection of productviewmodels to the view
when the user goes to add a product to the cart client-side you store an array of objects consisting of the product id and quantity



55973102
nscache uiimage
Pattern(s): 5	
i was also having same issue cached images in nscache evicted when app goes into background
i did create an example to handle this issue available in github import thing is to not here uiimage is not cached into nscache directly



56032185
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 5	
and here is the screenshot - google-chrome left safari right
this is going to seem dumb - but move the into the filter element instead of the fecomponenttransfer - safari doesn t seem to check for it when it s put into a primitive



56038238
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
this is not a python convention it is what oo best practice suggests you should do given the language you happen to be using leaves this decision up to you the superclass doesn t know about the subclassing but the subclassing is expected to know about the semantics of the superclass it inherited from
ultimately it is up to the subclassing to maintain a consistent behavior of a true sub-typing which unfortunately the python language does little to help the programmer with



56081613
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 5	
adding to the above two answers ensure your tensorflow keras environment is using python 3.6
keras tensorflow doesn t work very well with python 3.7 as of may 10 2019



56101390
children parent
Pattern(s): 1	
this should cause the element to wrap the floated children and make them visible that way
you don t write which element has the dimensions 659.08 x 0 but this sounds very much like all its child elements are floated and the parent therefore doesn t have any height because it doesn t wrap floated elements by default



56119344
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 5	
for example the virtualbox shared-folder filesystems allows control characters colon and pipe in filenames
in windows ntfs filenames cannot contain the ascii control characters 0x01 - 0x1f



56124867
pyenv virtualenv
Pattern(s): 1	
or you can just install python from source to somewhere under your home dir -- but pyenv makes it easy to switch to that installation and back.
a virtualenv doesn t have a full python installation



56154713
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
for more visit android your cpu does not support vt-x
a solution from android studio documentation if you have an amd processors in your computer you need the following setup requirements to be in place amd processors recommended amd ryzen processors android studio 3.2 beta or higher download via android studio preview page android emulator v27.3.8+ download via android studio sdk manager x86 android virtual device avd create avd windows 10 with april 2018 update enable via windows features windows hypervisor platform



56206348
super self
Pattern(s): 5	
note that super does not always return the parent object
if the method dedicatedmasterstrategymixin.propose_update self ... calls super dedicatedmasterstrategymixin self .propose_update ... it finds the next propose_update method according to the method resolution order mro



56215961
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
by default maven will not process copy resource files from the directory with sources
you need to explicitly configure it in pom.xml or move the resource files into folder that will be of a resource type



56236441
ngrx rxjs
Pattern(s): 1	
combilelatest - when any observable emits a value emit the latest value from each notice ngrx selectors not completes if your input observables it s ngrx selectors use combinelatest
rxjs provides several operators for combining streams you can find list of this operators here in your case i can recommend you use combinelatest or forkjoin which to use depend on type of input observables forkjoin - when all observables complete emit the last emitted value from each



56265741
viewdidload viewdidappear
Pattern(s): 5	
the sample code for that library has you call fpc.addpanel in your view controller s viewdidload not in viewdidappear
the viewdidload function is only called once in the lifetime of a view controller but viewdidappear is called every time a view controller get s re-shown like when it is redisplayed after being covered by a modal and then uncovered again. the two are not interchangeable for that reason



56268217
strtol atoi
Pattern(s): 5	
you ll also notice that strtol has a lot of error-checking involved while atoi does not
this is precisely why using atoi is not recommended



56281698
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
so when doing -v c data c app you hidden from your container all your application files inside app and left with only the files that exists in the host s c data directory possible solution create entrypoint script then mount the host folder to temp docker run -v c data c temp test
when you are mounting volume with docker you are overriding the directory not adding to it



56353153
gunicorn uwsgi
Pattern(s): 2	
you can use gunicorn uwsgi to serve django
but gunicorn uwsgi does not serve static files hence using reverse proxy server to serve static files



56354107
strtol atoi
Pattern(s): 5	
a possible way to achieve what you want is to use atoi or better strtol to convert the user input to integer type and then use the modulo operaptor to extract each digit and add them
atoi does not do what you think it does



56376599
filesystems fat
Pattern(s): 1	
it says the filesystems library facilities may be unavailable if a hierarchical filesystems is not accessible to the implementation or if it does not provide the necessary capabilities
some features may not be available if they are not supported by the underlying filesystems the fat filesystems lacks symbolic links and forbids multiple hardlinks



56424762
int chars
Pattern(s): 3	
the reason you see the large value in your first printf statement is that you are casting a signed chars to an unsigned int where the chars has already overflowed
the machine interprets the chars as -126 first and then casts to unsigned int which cannot represent that negative value so you get the max value of the signed int and subtract 126



56424832
int chars
Pattern(s): 1	
int doesn t match the format specifier u which requires unsigned int
on exotic systems which your target is not where unsigned chars is as large as int it will be promoted to unsigned int instead in which case 4 would have ub since it requires an int



56515676
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
plus normally you should set carousel width not height
if you want to set it s height see complete answer



56523497
paramiko subprocess
Pattern(s): 1	
using encrypted private key in paramiko is not possible because ssh-agent doesn t give private key without memory dump
the solution would be to use subprocess and call ssh command from that as any usual command



56568360
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
you can do something like remember to add +1 to the index and your method would be this will be better that using a for-loop its not optimal it will increase o n .
you need to iterate over an arrays to make the ngfor work this means that you need to make an arrays from the number of days as srjkaa said on his example



56583994
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
take a closer look at this section in this for-loop i is not an integer
since this is evaluated as a for each loops it represents the current variable not the index at which that variable exists



56596624
san workgroup
Pattern(s): 5	
they generally require subject and san to contain in addition to dns name s and possibly ip address es validated as belonging to the applicant see next only human-understandable and non-misleading identifiers like the company name
but see below. cas not used trusted publicly such as private cas within a business agency society or workgroup do not necessarily have to follow these rules although violating them may cause issues with software that was designed on the expectation or assumption they are followed



56634095
range max
Pattern(s): 1	
luckily the range class offers the handy method tolist which you can leverage for converting the range into a list and resolve the problem like in the following code snippet
2 to max is not a scala.collection.immutable.list indeed but a scala.collection.immutable.range more precisely an instance of scala.collection.immutable.range.inclusive as mentioned in your error message



56660363
foreground tray
Pattern(s): 5	
fcm response with only data block in this case removing notification blocks from json to device token list data body body of your notification in data title title of your notification in title key_1 value for key_1 image_url www.abc.com xyz.jpeg key_2 value for key_2 app in foreground onmessagereceived remotemessage remotemessage called shows largeicon and bigpicture in the notification bar
we can read the content from both notification and data block app in background onmessagereceived remotemessage remotemessage called system tray will not receive the message because of notification key is not in the response



56661533
foreground tray
Pattern(s): 5	
fcm response with only data block in this case removing notofocation blocks from json to device token list data body body of your notification in data title title of your notification in title key_1 value for key_1 image_url www.abc.com xyz.jpeg key_2 value for key_2 app in foreground onmessagereceived remotemessage remotemessage called shows largeicon and bigpicture in the notification bar

56695223
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 1	
i had the same problem with this tutorial and as others have mentioned the version of keras doesn t support separableconv1d
however just updating the version of keras without also updating tensorflow caused other errors in the jupyter notebook



56714658
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
the name calloc means contiguous allocation
no of blocks malloc assigns single block of demanded memory calloc assigns multiple blocks of the requested memory initialization malloc doesn t clear and initialize the allocated memory



56718965
clang icc
Pattern(s): 1	
footnote 1 except for x86-64 system v where clang uses an extra un-documented feature of the calling convention narrow integer types as function args in registers are assumed to be sign-extended to 32 bits
gcc and clang both do this when calling but icc does not so calling clang functions from icc-compiled code can cause breakage



56721429
calloc malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
calloc function assigns memory that is the size of what s equal to num size
you can see the following difference for mallac and calloc function initialization malloc doesn t clear and initialize the allocated memory



56756400
rcharts plotly
Pattern(s): 1	
i was a heavy rcharts user but nowadays in my opinion plotly is a better supported option rcharts is not in cran anymore
furthermore plotly has an automatic way to make ggplot2 charts interactive



56770287
width height
Pattern(s): 1	
one caveat that you need to be aware of when using this method is that the row height and column width may not carry over to the new workbook
to keep row height and column width you can first do move or copy sheet to the new workbook to ensure column width and row height are acceptable and then copy the content using source format again



56787379
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome displays the disappearance of the cookie immediatly
for me it seems this is an firefox issue not updating the developer information correctly



56799215
background-color transparency
Pattern(s): 1	
background-color is not inherited so it will use its initial value which is transparency that s why you see no color
now if we consider the fallback cases 3 using initial means the initial value of background color so transparency using inherit means inherit the color but there is nothing to inherit so transparency again using unset we will have a mix of inherit and initial the unset css keyword resets a properties to its inherited value if it inherits from its parent and to its initial value if not



56811503
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
no because subclassing are not forced to have the same constructors as their superclass they can have more or fewer constructors
superclass has no explicit constructors subclassing are not forced to have an explicit constructor



56828319
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
i get no error when i run the following output in init and without init first read this automatic initializer inherited as mentioned above subclassing do not inherited their superclass initializers by default
however superclass initializers are automatically inherited if certain conditions are met



56828612
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
one of the problems is that you are hard-coding paths for just image 1.jpeg and therefore any other images within the folder are not moved
take a look at this code snippet this code snippet will scan the source directory containing several images and will move these images to the destination directory



56859418
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
the salt is stored together with the hash to make it possible to validate it
had the salt not been stored it would be impossible to validate the hash since you don t know the full input to the hash which includes the salt



56863484
imagemagick mogrify
Pattern(s): 5	
the bottom line is that it is not a proper imagemagick convert command
if you want to process all images in a folder use mogrify not convert



56867043
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 3	
given that the pom.xml extract is mostly about a custom plugin and its configuration you will have to develop a matching gradle plugin to replicate the features of the maven plugin
maven plugins cannot be used by gradle



56889523
jobs cron
Pattern(s): 1	
the overlapping jobs are not queued and are skipped
the behaviour of fixedrate and cron is different



57014989
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 3	
quicksorta performs marginally better than mergesort for large datasets on my system but performance will depend on the actual implementation of quicksort which does not necessarily use a quicksort algorithm
mergesort does not allocate any extra memory and performs a stable sort which makes it a clear winner to sort lists



57020510
margin border-box
Pattern(s): 5	
for example on large screens you want them to be 33.33 wide but if you add margin on the left right the card will have a width of 33.33 + margin which makes the flexbox container wrap after two items because otherwise the total width would be more than 100
you can solve this by a setting things to box-sizing border-box doesn t help with margin tough



57030380
division multiplication
Pattern(s): 5	
when tried with only multiplication division try without sum assignment operations
edit as you can see multiplication is not necessarily the faster operation here



57069443
ionic angular
Pattern(s): 2	
i recommend you to use ionic and doesn t care about things like this
in order to help you with this you should tell us if you re using angular router to navigate



57140596
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
got solution for me go to your project directory and check if this folder exists android app src main assets i if it exists then delete two files viz index.android.bundle and index.android.bundle.meta ii if the folder assets doesn t exist then create the assets directory there
from your root project directory do cd android . gradlew clean finally navigate back to the root directory and check i if there is only one file index.js then run following command react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android app src main assets index.android.bundle --assets-dest android app src main res note that is one single command



57143711
isnull nullif
Pattern(s): 3	
introduction darkrob s answer probably contains the code you actually need - the change of nullif to isnull is probably the correct solution to your problem
this answer is not an attempt to solve the problem but to explain why it happens in the first place and how a code that actually need nullif and not isnull should be written



57159083
jquery jsignature
Pattern(s): 1	
i use jquery 3.4 had the same issue
im not quite sure where the problem came from but it was the phantom. first i added all recommended libs to my project and accessed the element as used to i received the same jsignature is not a function afterwards i assumed the problem might be in jquery version compatability so added few lines it was keeping throw the same error jsignature is not a function



57159811
virtualenv setuptools
Pattern(s): 5	
what i ve found is that you need to investigate your python interpreter location and make sure the virtualenv is not causing problems
for instance if setuptools won t update then most likely there is already a part of your code or project that is continually using setuptools - prohibiting it from updating - and other packages need new versions of setuptools to install



57182043
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
innodb is a transactional storage engine of mysql whereas myisam is a non-transactional storage engine
in other words innodb follows the acid properties to maintain the integrity of data but myisam doesn t follow acid properties thus failing to maintain the integrity of the data



57214679
cpython ironpython
Pattern(s): 5	
i wanted to verify that cpython was in fact waiting to verify the error handler until a decoding error was encountered and that ironpython was not so i checked the source code for both implementations
cpython below is the code for the pyunicode_decodeutf8stateful function found in the unicodeobject.c file for python 2.6.2



57231921
windows wow64
Pattern(s): 5	
the file system redirector of wow64 emulator redirects file system paths of systemroot system32 to systemroot syswow64 where systemroot is the a system environment variable which refers to the windows directory c windows
so normally the wow64 processes 32-bit processes running on 64-bit windows can not access the system32 directory



57237468
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the second last else statement checks the utf-16 values of the alphabet you can cast a chars to an int which determines ist value in utf-16 encoding for the lower cases it is 97-122 and for the upper cases their values are 65-90
if the int value of the chars is not in this range the chars is not in the alphabet



57241965
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
removing the empty rows in the arrays and giving the right limit in the for-loop fixed the problem
per tehhowch the problem is that my for-loop did not account for the header rows in my spreadsheet or that an arrays is 0-indexed



57245740
html2canvas jspdf
Pattern(s): 5	
steps to reproduce stackblitz angular.json dependancies i ve avoided an issue with html2canvas by using html2canvas 1.0.0-rc.1
see - the latest version of jspdf is not working with some issue with file-saver so i ve just gone for the version i know works jspdf 1.4.1 include types types html2canvas types jspdf for some reason in stackblitz you need to import these using import jspdf from jspdf

Pattern(s): 5	
google-chrome supports both path it was google s original idea and composedpath
firefox dose not supports e.path so change e.path to firefox supports composedpath



57275380
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
strict-transport-security in the deployment recommendations of hsts preload list it is stated add the strict-transport-security header to all https responses in apache this would look like note i did not include the preload directive developers should read the hsts preload list s deployment recommendations first before adding that x-xss-protection if you are using csp without allowing unsafe-inline then you probably don t need to worry about x-xss-protection anymore google-chrome has an intent to deprecate and remove the xss auditor
firefox have not and will not implement x-xss-protection



57296290
flatmap concatmap
Pattern(s): 5	
flatmap still doesn t care
concatmap however waits for a stream to complete before subscribing to the next



57300748
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
android app src main assets if the folder assets doesn t exist then create the assets directory there
if it exists then delete two files viz index.android.bundle and index.android.bundle.meta then return to the root project directory and execute the command



57339610
setinterval settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
as mentioned above setinterval does not play well with promises if you do not stop it
in case you clear the interval you can use it like it seems that it s settimeout that fits the case

postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
08 00 00 time is how you do a type cast in postgresql not mysql
mysql uses the sql standard cast



57343034
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
for maximum flexibility use the layouts folder as mentioned by dan
if you need to provide custom routes to your users like domain.com then putting a file with a name _.vue in your pages directory will not work because you ll need it for your custom user routes



57352574
bytearrayoutputstream inputstream
Pattern(s): 5	
once done close out the bytearrayoutputstream and do whatever processing is needed
by doing so the original inputstream does not have to be touched or interrupted in any way



57354683
kombu celery
Pattern(s): 5	
to communicate with rabbitmq kombu uses either py-amqp or if installed librabbitmq
celery is not made to be arbitrary mq consumer



57364462
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 3	
for example you lose the ability to cull out-of-frustum objects on the cpu which is highly recommended best practice even on a more modern gpu
mali-400 is an old design with a very single vertex processors which doesn t scale with increasing core count so it can definitely struggle with vertex complexity where complexity is



57373441
hive hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
hive cannot extract the schema from the data
in order to read the data from the avro files in hdfs using a hive query hive requires a schema

inline constexpr
Pattern(s): 3	
constexpr does not imply inline for variables c++17 inline variables while constexpr does imply inline for functions it does not have that effect for variables considering c++17 inline variables
and remove the inline leaving just constexpr then the variable gets multiple addresses which is the main thing inline variables avoid

int double
Pattern(s): 5	
also from the same javadoc regarding the conversion d integral the result is formatted as a decimal int so the format specifier you need for int is d which you are correctly using however an int does not have precision
a float or a double may have precision but int does not

apache nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
you can have nginx take error response codes coming from apache in consideration and act differently by use of proxy_intercept_errors which combined with error_page can allow you to rewrite response codes error messages from apache to masquarade app failures as service unavailable
nginx will not alter the 500 from the app as long as it doesn t step on a problem contacting fetching data from apache



57452719
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 3	
if apache is completely down you should be getting a 502 bad gateway because in your setup apache is the gateway for nginx
the same will happen if nginx does not like apache s response in a way when apache sends a response which has headers exceeding nginx s proxy_buffer_size yes you should be getting 504 gateway timeout when apache app is timing out in relation to nginx timeouts see point 2

prometheus metrics
Pattern(s): 5	
if you don t see the metrics in apis custom.metrics.k8s.io v1beta1 it means that the prometheus adapter couldn t discover it
the prometheus adapter discovers metrics by using the value of your seriesquery field for an api v1 series request to prometheus done periodically with a frequency defined by the relist interval



57495483
keras tensorflow
Pattern(s): 1	
keras doesn t have an eager mode like tensorflow and it depends on models or functions with placeholders to receive and output data
so it s a little more complicated than tensorflow to do basic calculations like this

free realloc
Pattern(s): 5	
since the argument to free is not declared neither is the first argument to realloc
realloc can free the memory that its argument points to if it can t reuse the same memory

folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
this class has properties that represent a directory including parent which returns a new directoryinfo for the parent folder
it also has a name property which is the name of the folder not to be confused with fullname which is the full path to the folder which we don t need



57549142
ienumerable ilist
Pattern(s): 1	
i suspect the main problem you are encountering is the fact that indexing into ienumerable is not possible
i would guess that ilist may be a more appropriate interface for the items which would allow greater control over the items in general



57556023
istio microservices
Pattern(s): 1	
istio implements the side-car pattern to be coupled to each microservices
the microservices not necessarily but usually are deployed in infrastructures that allow elastic scaling in which the system is delegated the task of adjusting the number of instances of each microservices based on the scaling strategy configured

velocity thymeleaf
Pattern(s): 3	
like nathan hugues said you can still use velocity it s just that spring dropped a support package for it
as mentionned in the blog post you quoted thymeleaf has spring support it is just provided by the thymeleaf team not the spring team

folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
for that reason a command line with dir and findstr is executed by for in a separate command process executed in background started with comspec c and the specified command line appended to get all file names to copy with filtering out all file names in source folder tree starting with folder path being equal target folder path
so executed by for is for example dir searches in specified directory c old and all its subdirectories because of option s for non-hidden files because of option a-d-h attribute not directory and not hidden matching the wildcard pattern any file name and outputs found in bare format just the file names because of option b with full path because of option s

installation upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
you may also need to run the database upgrade several times. also make sure you move your old 1.14 wiki installation to an extra folder and upload a fresh mediawiki installation do not just overwrite your existing files in the 1.14 one with the new mediawiki versioning
in the end i went the long route and upgrade versioning by versioning first on a local xampp dump then on the server after i identified all the issues for each versioning upgrade checked the release notes for each versioning and made the required changes to my custom skins replaced deprecated extensions etc

width height
Pattern(s): 3	
swift 5.0 code for pavel alexeev s solution. accounting for some syntax updates and also screen width because i ve found that if the device is being held in the landscape orientation when the app is launched the screen height is not the actual portrait height but the current landscape height
so i check that the width is accounted for too



57628015
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
your for-loop will iterate only two times because you zip list with all mondays with list that contains only two elements that means as well that you will check only two first mondays of this year as well
this for complicated loops is not necessary



57632974
luis bots
Pattern(s): 3	
if you ve done your reading you should see that dispatch works like this your bots calls only the parent dispatch luis app the parent dispatch luis app looks at its intents to see if any match any of its connected child apps luis or qnamaker if it matches luis it returns the top intent from that child app
if it matches qnamaker it returns the qnamaker intent and your code should call qnamaker i have a sneaking suspicion that your luis apps aren t laid out correctly

folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
i ve seen the security error when an asp.net application failed to generate temporary files xml serialization assembly in the following circumstances running under an account without a profile so no account-specific temp directory did not have permission to access the windows temp folder
it s a subjective question but i would treat its unavailability as a fatal error the same as i would do with a temp folder that is inaccessible due to security permissions

google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
according to the discussion about this google-chrome bug google-chrome has a hard limit of 500 peer connections and closed connections are also included until they are garbage collected by the browser
it seems like firefox does not have the same problem



57697032
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
if you would want use while loops you should use 6 instead not 6 because when for finally a 6 and then the for-loop would run again
use while loops is not necessary because for stop when there aren t more dict in the list



57720702
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
in your file directory that contains your ipynb file there is a folder called .ipynb_checkpoints
this folder does not show in the jupyter application so find it through windows explorer. inside there s will be a file called urfilenamehere-checkpoint.ipynb copy paste it to your file directory and open through the jupyter application it should probably work

hive hdfs
Pattern(s): 1	
you can see below pages for more info my answer about msck repair language ddl - apache hive hope the above answer helps you
when you add partitions manually in hdfs and not through hive query statements hive does not capture these directory details automatically and we need to make the hms to be aware of the newly added hdfs directory by running msck repair
