maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 3	5	
maven helps quite a lot with this problem when i m coding java
we commit the pom.xml to the scs and the maven repository contains all our dependencies. for me that seems like a nice way to do it

int chars
Pattern(s): 4	3	
so would produce an error because int is not an object
int is one of the few primitives in java along with chars and some others

int chars
Pattern(s): 1	5	
so int is a fancy way to work with an int just as perhaps string is a fancy way to work with a group of chars

hash md5
Pattern(s): 0	
the better you can optimize your password hash function the faster your password hash function gets the weaker your scheme is
md5 and sha1 even conventional block ciphers like des are designed to be fast

phpunit is run from the linux command line by default though there are http interfaces available for it
simpletest is web-based by nature and is much easier to get up and running imo

further update just fyi i am not trying to push emacs over vim it s just what i use and it s a great editor as i m sure vim is too
it is daunting at first as i m sure vim is too but the question was about text editors on linux besides vi.
emacs seems the logical choice to me but gedit is a great simple text editor with some nice features if that s all you are looking for

for the rails side of things though i d actually suggest a virtual machine running linux. ubuntu works well the only caveat is that you have to install rubygems manually as it does not adhere to the great debian filesystem naming ideology - i suggest this because if you want to do advanced things such as installing imagemagick rmagick or memcached or a number of other plugins which require native c libraries it becomes very painful very quickly if you re on windows

then the two items are definitely not equals
all you want is a gethashcode algorithm that splits up your collection into roughly even groups - it shouldn t form the key as the hashtable or will need to use the hash to optimise retrieval

Pattern(s): 3	1	3	5	
rss is not an official internet standards track protocol

int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
to read the 2nd bit of a bitset you need to find the int that contains the bit you want in this case it s the first int bitwise and that int with 2 value 0x02 to find out if that bit is set however if memory is a bottleneck and you have a lot of boolean using a bitset could make sense if you re target platform is a mobile phone or it s some state in a very busy web service note a std vector of bool usually has a specialisation to use the equivalent of a bitset thus making it much smaller and also slower for the same reasons
so if speed is an issue you ll be better off using a vector of chars or even int or even just use an old school bool array

apache lighttpd
Pattern(s): 5	5	
or you can serve django without using apache but with another server that supports fastcgi natively the documentation mentions that you can do this if you don t have any apache specific needs
i guess the reason must be to save memory. lighttpd this is the server that runs youtube

bazaar git
Pattern(s): 0	5	1	
most of the people were reluctant to move over as they have to type in two commands to commit and push bazaar ci + bazaar push
also it was difficult for them to understand the concept of branches and merging no one uses branches or merges them in svn

subclass abstract-class
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	
in this way i am saying that foouser subclass is not an account but does act like an editable object
likewise baraccount extends from account but is not a user subclass but implements editable listable and also versionable
adding all of these apis for editable listable and versionable into the abstract-class itself would not only be cluttered and ugly but would either duplicate the common interfaces in account and user or force my user object to implement versionable probably just to throw an exception

when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above



35967
apache lighttpd
Pattern(s): 6	
if you have spare physical resources and have the technical skills and experience to maintain production machines running different operating systems i d recommend going running lighttpd on either linux or freebsd
a light os install with a static file optimized server will perform faster than apache or iis on a heavy os



37408
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 1	
that makes the rendezvous between the app and the daemons trivial and it also makes it straightforward to develop multiple front-ends or possibly a framework that wraps communication with the daemons
the mac os x launchd systemd is really cool this way

sorting filtering
Pattern(s): 3	3	
wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise
finally if your data is typically noisy and you re getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output or even referenced just not differential and if you re averaging lots of observations into each data point try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains



44576
profiling debugging
Pattern(s): 1	3	
i choose to log deliberately as i go as this means the log data is meaningful depending on logging framework you can add level severity category information so that the log data can be filtered you can make sure that the right level of information is present not too much not too little you know when writing the code which the most important things are and can therefore ensure they are logged using some form of code injection profiling or tracing tool to generate logs would most likely generate verbose less useful logs that would be harder to dive into
they may be useful as a debugging aid however



45272
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 5	
as you point out the term load balancing carries the implication of multiple servers - what you want to look for is information about how to write a linux network daemons
the two kes systemd calls you ll want to look at are called fork and exec

phpunit simpletest
Pattern(s): 1	
i found the zend to phpunit connection much harder to get working especially with the debugger
the way we use simpletest in-house is with a continuous integration script that we wrote ourselves



47472
goto break
Pattern(s): 3	
i had a series of five nested counted loops and i needed to be able to break out of the entire structure from the inside early based on certain conditions i could just have easily declared a boolean break variable and used it as part of the conditional for each loop but in this instance i decided a goto was just as practical and just as readable



52266
switching screens
Pattern(s): 6	
if you had one controller running on the box in front of which you sit you could use keyboard and mouse input to switching it between open sockets with different renderers
you shouldn t need to resize the output window to less than full screens anymore with this approach ever



53125
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
to me adding a symlink pointing to your development folder seems like a tidy solution to the problem
if the main project is on a different machine webserver you could use something like sshfs to mount your development directory into the right place on the webserver



54968

hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
the usual solution is to use a secret salt plus additional user information to make the hashed results unique- something like as long as your salt is secret or your attacker doesn t know the precise creation date of the user s record a dictionary attack will fail- even in the event that they are able to pull down the password field



60077
children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
as far as i know a process doesn t have an explicit list of its children s pids but it can easily be built since a process should know which child processes it spawns
for example the unix fork call returns the child pid in the parent process and 0 in the child process createprocess on windows returns iirc the pid of the new process created

folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
the default folder is actually the same as the current working folder for the buffer it can be different for every file you work with
say that the file you are working with is located in c dir_a then the working directory for that buffer will by default be c dir_a

g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 1	3	3	1	
but i m pretty sure g++ v4 is the standard development c++ compiler if you install the c++ development environment at all
g++ v3 is usually just available as a special install

64422
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
next you need to know that the fourth number in these lines is a measure of idle time and thus the fourth number on the cpu line is the total idle time for all processors since boot time



64422
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
for example if you take a sample and get cpu 2330047 0 2365006 1063853632 9035 9463 96114 0 then one second later you get this sample cpu 2330047 0 2365007 1063854028 9035 9463 96114 0 subtract the two numbers and you get a diff of 396 which means that your cpu had been idle for 3.96 seconds out of the last 1.00 second
the trick of course is that you need to divide by the number of processors



65472
perforce cvs
Pattern(s): 3	
if you want to stick to the older centralized model i d recommend perforce if you can afford it or subversion if you don t want to pay for perforce
i d recommend subversion over cvs because it s got enough features to make it worthwhile but is similar enough that devs who already know cvs will still be comfortable

quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 1	
from the wikipedia entry on quicksort quicksort also competes with mergesort another recursive sort algorithm but with the benefit of worst-case θ nlogn running time. mergesort is a stable sort unlike quicksort and heapsort and can be easily adapted to operate on linked lists and very large lists stored on slow-to-access media such as disk storage or network attached storage. although quicksort can be written to operate on linked lists it will often suffer from poor pivot choices without random access

70430
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 3	3	5	5	
wikipedia s explanation is typically quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other θ nlogn algorithms because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures and in most real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the probability of requiring quadratic time
quicksort mergesort i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is ω n that quicksort implementations don t have



70741
subtract addition
Pattern(s): 5	1	6	
in the first loop you can use plain addition since you are only ever oring with single bits and you can narrow the scope of by iterating over indices
in the second loop you can subtract 1 from the index instead of producing an unnecessary 0th output list element that needs to be shift ed off and where you unnecessarily iterate m n times where m is the number of output lists and n is the number of unique elements iterating over the unique elements would reduce the iterations to just n which is a significant win in typical use cases where m is much larger than n and would simplify the code

mercurial and bazaar resemble themselves very much on the surface
they both provide basic distributed version control as in offline commit and merging multiple branches are both written in python and are both slower than git



77943
bazaar git
Pattern(s): 1	1	
git is fastest but all three are fast enough
bazaar is the most flexible it has transparent read-write support for svn repositories and cares a lot about the user experience



77945
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 3	3	6	0	5	1	1	
with o n 2 worst case that rarely happens quicksort is potentially far slower than the o nlogn of the merge sort
quicksort has less overhead so with small n and slow computers it is better
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases

subtraction addition
Pattern(s): 8	5	
addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as 0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72

hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
username donkey key 99754106633f94d350db34d548d6091a server checks if his calculated hash is the same as the one submitted
advantages of this method -server never knows password only salt hash



88049
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
advantages of this method -server never knows password only salt hash
-even the hash is never transmitted through the wire - no replay attacks



89677
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 3	1	
if you re connecting to a named instance and udp is not available when connecting to it then you may need to specify the protocol as well
example tcp 192.168.1.21 sql2k5 1443



89848
profiling benchmarking
Pattern(s): 5	
which just goes to show if you don t know how to do proper code profiling don t be doing this stuff
the speed difference of these two methods are within the same big o speed as proven by leon timmermans opcode analyisis - the benchmarking are just going to show differences based on other local conditions not necessarily your code



90040
put get
Pattern(s): 1	
you could not get a 100 but still have tested all your 80 freq used code-paths
having tests that test every throw exceptiontypex or similar defensive programming guard you ve put in is a nice to have not a must have so trust yourself or your developers to be thorough and cover every path through their code



90062
umbraco dotnetnuke
Pattern(s): 5	
umbraco gets my vote as a good cms that comes close to joomla in maturity and out of the box functionality
i m not that fond of dotnetnuke but it s been at least a year since i ran it thru its paces



91993
boost allocator
Pattern(s): 5	
you may see a factor 10 speed-boost just plugging a simple pool allocator into the dictionary template
afaik boost has a component that can be directly used



94447
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	1	
suppose this method is changed in the parent class to this change will not cause any compile time errors or warnings - but it completely changes the intended behavior of the subclassing
to answer your question you should use the override annotation if the lack of a method with the same signature in a superclass is indicative of a bug



95522
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
you could make an annotation enforceauthor with inherited on the superclass and use compiler annotations since java 1.6 to catch up at compile time
then you have a reference to the subclassing and can check if another annotation author is missing



97431
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 1	
google-chrome is full featured browser
so you should be asking for webkit rendering engine google-chrome use developed by safari s guys control



98683
allegro sdl
Pattern(s): 5	5	
for allegro there is collegro
for sdl there is sdl_collide.h or sdl-collide



99194
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	1	
i would agree that the for-loop is clearer and more appropriate when iterating
the while loops is appropriate for polling or where the number of loops to meet exit condition will change based on activity inside loops



99235
x86 mips
Pattern(s): 3	1	8	
sgi used to but now their machines are all on x86 ia-64 chips. if you find assembly language appealing and want to work in assembly further learn the arm instruction set
arm is only a little more complex than mips and virtually all mobile phones smart phones and pdas now use arm chips made by dozens of manufacturers



102717
extjs gxt
Pattern(s): 1	5	1	5	
gwt extjs is a gwt wrapper around the extjs library
gxt is native gwt



102717
extjs gxt
Pattern(s): 3	1	5	
however the future is with gxt as it s native gwt and actually developed by the company that made extjs
gwt extjs is somewhat crippled as the license changed on the extjs library thus slowing the development of gwt extjs
overall i think gwt gxt is a good solution for developing a web application



103227
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	5	
comparing hash is a good solution
make sure that you don t just salt all the credit card numbers with the same constant salt though



103658
rsa aes
Pattern(s): 5	
there should be implementations of rsa available for all the languages you mentioned
if you don t care if the third-party can decrypt the data then aes is the way to go



105339
int double
Pattern(s): 1	
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

maven m2e
Pattern(s): 3	
unlike most build tools maven uses conventions wisely well better than many others at least and it has plugins for every area you mentioned unit tests maven surefire plugin eclipse integration m2e deploying war file war plugin and deploy plugin maven can also help you in integration tests on tomcat if you have some since you can start stop or deploy a war using the cargo plugin



105570

107415
post put
Pattern(s): 1	
an http put is supposed to accept the body of the request and then store that at the resource identified by the uri
an http post is more general



107450
post put
Pattern(s): 4	5	
http 1.1 rfc location for post difference between post and put the rfc itself explains the core difference the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is reflected in the different meaning of the request-uri
the uri in a post request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed entity



107883
factors mean
Pattern(s): 1	5	
if instead we want to say that a function grows exactly as quickly as some other function we use theta to make that point i ll write t f n to mean theta of f n in markdown
t g n is short hand for being bounded from above and below by g n again up to a scaling factors and asymptotically



108030
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
there are various standard reliable udp protocols out there what experiences do you have with them
i think you really need to prove to yourself that tcp is in fact too slow for your needs if you need reliability in your protocol



109038
cairngorm puremvc
Pattern(s): 5	
in short cairngorm is the visualbasic of flex it works but will teach you a lot of bad habits
puremvc isn t so bad it just isn t a very good fit for writing flex applications



110037
jxtable jtable
Pattern(s): 5	4	1	5	
jxtable is an extension of jtable that supports multi-column sorting as well as other functions that jtable doesn t provide



113048
width margin
Pattern(s): 1	
also make sure that their row has a fixed width which is equal to the sum of the cell widths + margin + padding



114000
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 5	
functions called using virtual dispatch are not inline there is one kind of penalty for virtual functions which is easy to forget about virtual calls are not inline in a common situation where the type of the object is not know compile time
if your function is small and suitable for inlining this penalty may be very significant as you are not only adding a call overhead but the compiler is also limited in how it can optimize the calling function it has to assume the virtual function may have changed some registers or memory locations it cannot propagate constant values between the caller and the callee



114544
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 5	5	3	
these databases are very different - mysql is speed and simplicity postgresql is robustness and concurrency
it will be easier for you to learn postgresql it is not that hard



115944
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	3	5	
therefore if there is no business logic for example when a getter simply returns a value or a setter sets it then there is no point in writing a test
if however there is some logic getter changes the data in some way before returning it then yes you should have a unit test. as a general rule i believe one should not write tests for beans that do not contain any business logic



116114
stdout stderr
Pattern(s): 3	
this is more easily and flexibly accomplished by redirecting the stdout stream further getting rid of stderr is easily accomplished in situations where it makes sense to use backticks i prefer to use the qx in order to emphasize that there is a heavy-weight command occurring



116753
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	5	
add a unique salt to the hash password value store the salt value in the db
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement



116753
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	1	
add a unique salt to the hash password value store the salt value in the db
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement



116753
salt md5
Pattern(s): 3	1	1	5	
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement



116767
salt md5
Pattern(s): 3	
the ready availability of cloud computing and powerful parallel-processor graphics cards means that passwords up to 8 or 9 characters hashed as md5 or sha1 are now trivially breakable
now a long salt is a must as is something tougher like sha512



118049
post get
Pattern(s): 1	5	
since you are calling this multiple times you may get better performance copying the list once and destructively deleting from it
alternatively looking back over your original post it is a little confusing.



120140
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
if you use maven there is an argument for saying that the .project and .classpath files are derived artifacts
this is only true if you generate them every time you do a build and if you have never had to tweak them by hand or inadvertently changed them by changing some preferences after generating them from the pom.xml



120284
lisp prolog
Pattern(s): 5	5	5	5	
add prolog like backtracking to the language that very seamlessly integrates with normal lisp code see screamer an xml templating extension to common lisp includes an example of reader macros that are plugins for the lisp parser a ton of small dsl s like loop or iterate for easy looping



122300
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 3	3	
i d also have to wonder why so many people have the root passwd
sudo is there specifically to avoid giving people the root password.



123307
lxml celementtree
Pattern(s): 5	
it s pythonic comes in the box with python 2.5 including the c version celementtree xml.etree.celementtree which is 20 times faster than the pure python version and is very easy to use
lxml has some perfomance advantages but they are uneven and you should check the benchmarks first for your use case



123307
lxml elementtree
Pattern(s): 5	
lxml has some perfomance advantages but they are uneven and you should check the benchmarks first for your use case

Pattern(s): 5	
the helpful bit of the googled post above is in fact this is a known bug in the windows xp visual styles implementation
certain controls like imagelist do not get properly initialized when they ve been created before the app calls application.enablevisualstyles

google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
fullscreen minimal google-chrome vnc server instance no visible ui + you can choose your resolution
use xinit with xvnc as the x server to do this - you ll need to read all the manpages

please have a look at this stackoverflow post which has a list of book recommendations
in terms of best practices get familiar with the m-v-vm pattern



133160
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 4	5	
afaik there is no difference on the part of browsers as both firefox and ie will incorrectly cache the response from a url with a querystring in the same way they cache the response from a url without a querystring
in the case of safari it respects the spec and doesn t cache urls with querystrings



135226
getter setter
Pattern(s): 5	
here s the full version breakdown ie 6-7 support jscript 5 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 ie 8 supports jscript 6 which is equivalent to ecmascript 3 javascript 1.5 - more bug fixes over jscript 5 firefox 1.0 supports javascript 1.5 ecmascript 3 equivalent firefox 1.5 supports javascript 1.6 1.5 + array extras + e4x + misc. firefox 2.0 supports javascript 1.7 1.6 + generator + iterators + let + misc. firefox 3.0 supports javascript 1.8 1.7 + generator expressions + expression closures + misc. the next version of firefox will support javascript 1.9 1.8 + to be determined opera supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc



135367
boost stl
Pattern(s): 5	6	
use of placeholders in a boost bind expression looks much less magical than naked boost lambda placeholders and finds easier acceptance during code reviews



135739
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
the for-loop is imperative the algorithms are declarative
when you write std max_element it s obvious what you need when you use a loops to achieve the same it s not necessarily so



137344
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
in cases where the diamond is not avoidable using virtual inherited
the biggest caveat however with virtual bases is that the constructor for the virtual base must be called by the most derived class meaning that a class that derives virtually has no control over the constructor parameters



139276
gridview repeater
Pattern(s): 5	5	3	
since you re building the layout by hand listview and repeater require more code
gridview is an updated datagrid so there is hardly any reason to use datagrid
gridview works really well when hooked up to standard asp.net datasources but restricts you to a tabular layout with lots of layout rules



140719
boost stl
Pattern(s): 1	5	
boost thread is great i m not sure whether you can say its part of the language though
it depends if you consider the crt stl boost to be part of c++ or an optional add-on library



142778
.htaccess httpd.conf
Pattern(s): 1	1	5	
also check that .htaccess is readable by the httpd process
check the error_log - it will tell you of any errors in .htaccess if it s being used. putting an intentional syntax error in .htaccess is a good check to make sure the file is being used -- you should get a 500 error on any page in the same directory
lastly you can enable a rewrite log using commands like the following in your httpd.conf rewritelog logs rewritelog rewriteloglevel 7 the log file thus generated will give you the gory detail of which rewrite rules matched and how they were handled



143221
bitarray bitvector
Pattern(s): 5	1	5	
bitarray was the best answer i found when i recently had a similar need
it s a c extension so much faster than bitvector which is pure python and stores its data in an actual bitfield so it s eight times more memory efficient than a numpy boolean array which appears to use a byte per element.



143267
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
here are the two ways for maven use the tomcat plugin
you don t need to include it in pom.xml just issue the goal mvn tomcat deploy the plugin is included in maven 2



143846

Pattern(s): 3	
if you want antialiasing make sure to use a format that supports transparency bmp and tga do
ppm does not



144089
ienumerable icollection
Pattern(s): 1	
however many linq methods special case for when the object implementing ienumerable actually implements icollection
i ve seen this for ienumerable.contains at least. in practice this means that linq ienumerable.contains calls the fast hashset.contains for example if the ienumerable actually is a hashset



144890
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 1	
other than that quicksort is known to be very fast on arrays just like mergesort is the common choice for lists



144997
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 3	5	
the inline keyword is just a hint to the compiler
some will even do inlining across translation units where they decide it s helpful



145200
ironruby ironpython
Pattern(s): 1	5	
this will allow you to run ironruby run most ruby programs when 1.0 ships then they can improve perf as they go
i suspect ironpython has a similar story



145897
nginx lighttpd
Pattern(s): 5	
inside each container you can setup apache or any other webserver nginx lighttpd .. . this way you don t have one apache for everything but could create a container for any subset of services per project



145952
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 5	
inline works like a copy paste controlled by the compiler which is quite different from a pre-processor macro the macro will be forcibly inlined will pollute all the namespaces and code won t be easily debuggable and will be done even if the compiler would have ruled it as inefficient



145952
inline-functions inlining
Pattern(s): 5	
it may also decide to inline-functions not marked as inline at compilation or linking time
inline works like a copy paste controlled by the compiler which is quite different from a pre-processor macro the macro will be forcibly inlined will pollute all the namespaces and code won t be easily debuggable and will be done even if the compiler would have ruled it as inefficient



147161
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
if the most significant bit of the int is 0 increase the exponent by one shift the int left by one and fill the least significant bit in with a new random bit
repeat until either you hit a 1 in the most significant place or else the exponent gets too big for your double 1023



147195
post put
Pattern(s): 5	
it s common to have uri differences or message content differences to distinguish between post and put when a person is clicking submit on a form
it however isn t very clean because your code has to determine if you re in the post create case or post update case



147195

under development for now but clang does c analysis and is targeted to handle c++ over time
it s part of the llvm project



149437
range max
Pattern(s): 3	1	
know your range of data
a float is only good for 6 to 7 digits of precision so that means a max of about +-9999.99 without rounding



149442
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 4	1	
at first i believed it was a built-in feature of the wysiwym markdown editor but shog9 is correct it s not baked-in at all but is courtesy of the jquery plugin textarearesizer i was lead astray by the browser was using to check on the editor demo because google-chrome itself adds the expandable functionality on textareas mdash
much like the safari browser does



150009
unsigned short
Pattern(s): 5	3	
i believe that compiler takes a hint to disable padding when you use the unsigned int wwindow 16 syntax
also note that a short is not guaranteed to be 16 bits



150148
filtering grouping
Pattern(s): 5	3	3	7	
extract method is the nearest a datatable provides in termes of filtering it returns an array of pointers to datarows
grouping is not so powerful as in tclientdataset as also indexing is poorer



150195
put get
Pattern(s): 5	
keytool doesn t have key export built in to avoid accidental disclosure of this sensitive material so you might want to consider some extra safeguards that could be put in place to protect your exported keys
here is some simple code that gives you unencrypted pkcs #8 privatekeyinfo that can be used by openssl see the -nocrypt option of its pkcs8 utility if you need other formats you can use a keyfactory to get a transparent key specification for different types of keys



150988
floating-point integer
Pattern(s): 5	5	
algorithms for going the other way printing the best decimal number from a floating-number are found in burger and dybvig s printing floating-point numbers quickly and accurately downloadable here
this also requires multiple-precision integer arithmetic see also david m gay s correctly rounded binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversions for algorithms going both ways



151336
installation upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
msiexec.exe then interprets this database to do the actual installation
the version property you mention is used by msi engine internally for upgrade uninstalls etc and is never displayed



152132
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 3	1	
doing it this way we can stay with versioning 1 of a project until upgrading to versioning 1.5 is absolutely necessary
you still have the job with adding dll s when deciding to upgrade to a other versioning of the dll though



152425
put get
Pattern(s): 1	5	5	
but don t just take my word for it in access-ordered linked hash maps merely querying the map with get is a structural modification the linked hash map s javadoc if you are absolutely sure that there are no caches no collection statistics no optimizations no funny stuff at all - you don t need to sync
in that case i would have put a type constraint on the collection don t declare the collection as a map which would allow linkedhashmap but as hashmap for the purists a final subclass of hashmap but that might be taking it too far...



153015
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
since ip has become the dominant protocol a port in networking terms has become synonomous with either a udp or tcp port number - which is a portion of the socket address
udp is connection-less - meaning no virtual circuit between the 2 endpoints is ever created



154070
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
if you re generating the link on the server we would need to know what server-side language you re using to give more specific advice
if you re generating the tag client-side as a string in javascript don t do that use document.createelement use the string.replace method on the argument string to pick out characters that will break the syntax you re generating and replace them with escaped versions



157456
perforce svn
Pattern(s): 1	
but the svn clients are better especially the eclipse plugin
perforce is more expensive



157551
perforce svn
Pattern(s): 5	
i have used both and in my experience perforce makes a lot of sense if you have a big team and or codebase
otherwise i would pick svn - it is easier to set up and maintain



157625
perforce svn
Pattern(s): 1	5	
it has features analogous to those available in perforce but is free foss
either is a great alternative to svn when working with a large team



157949
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 3	3	
a form should always have server-side validation
client-side validation is only there as a convenience



159454
width height
Pattern(s): 1	1	
you need to listen for width changes on the content composite mparent compute the minimum height again given the new content width and call setminheight on the scrolled composite with new height
in listening for size changes note that we ignore any resize events where the width stays the same
this is because changes in the height of the content do not affect the minimum height of the content as long as the width is the same



167434
boost stl
Pattern(s): 5	
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost
boost only provides the tr1 containers for those compilers that do not yet include tr1

Pattern(s): 1	
if i attach an onclick handler to the submit button i can see that the button is being clicked - but if i attach an onsubmit handler to the form i get nothing
if i make the button onclick handler submit the form through javascript it works fine - it s just the direct submission that s not working

Pattern(s): 5	
declare accessors using properties you make life much simpler for yourself if you always use accessor methods to assign values to instance variables except in and dealloc methods



172899
wordpress joomla
Pattern(s): 3	1	
if you don t have many complex requirements i think wordpress is not a bad idea
if you need to expand the site later on and add different functionality like forums gallery polls etc. you better go for a proper cms solution like joomla drupal and likewise



173007
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 3	
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this



173406
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 1	5	
currently i believe that safari is the only shipping browser to support any of these and i believe it only supports the client side databases and local storage parts
edit olliej correction firefox 3 supports the application cache but alas not the client side db



173419
profiling benchmarking
Pattern(s): 6	
into your code allowing you to arbitrarily benchmarking any section of code note only recommended for short sections not things taking dozens of milliseconds or more
its accurate to the clock cycle though in some rare cases it can change how the code in between is compiled in which case you re better off with a profiling though profiling are generally more effort to use for specific sections of code



176144
opera firefox
Pattern(s): 3	1	3	0	
my support list in order of priority currently looks like this unless a client expresses a need to expand it safari 3 firefox 2 firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 beta public-facing functionality works looks correct in ie 6 google-chrome the reason i take this approach is that first it s best to work in a standards-compliant browser before tweaking to broken engines
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 3	
probably due to a delphi background and i always make it private to avoid the problem when the inherited is erroneously omitted from a class but a subclassing tries to use it



181372
matlab simulink
Pattern(s): 1	5	
for further comparison with python i can say that matlab provides a full package for you to do your work without the need of looking around for external libraries and implementing extra functions
one last point about matlab which i see is not mentioned in the answers here is that it has a very powerful visual modeling simulation environment called simulink



182092
int boolean
Pattern(s): 1	
as a workaround i ve done the following which will replace the text of the statement with the numbers ending up as something like where buildingid in 1 2 3 4 note that this is getting close to a sql injection vulnerability but since it s an int array is safe
arbitrary strings are not safe but there s no way to embed sql statements in an integer or datetime boolean etc



182664
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 5	
the latest versions of ubuntu include an installer called wubi which installs ubuntu as a windows application ie it can be uninstalled from add remove programs and sets up the dual boot for you
it s great for those who want to give linux a try without a system overhaul



182776

inherited properties
Pattern(s): 1	5	1	5	
adding a properties to the prototype of a function object will make it available to the constructed object as well as to all of the objects which inherit from it
advantages there may not be a hard and fast rule as to why prototypal inherited is an advantageous form of code-reuse
code reuse itself is advantageous and prototypal inherited is a sensible way of going about it



186668
folder directory
Pattern(s): 3	
no matter if you use safari or firefox or possibly another browser it is standard or mac that browsers search their plugins in that folder
it is named library internet plug-ins and as always on mac this directory exists twice



189634
inherited properties
Pattern(s): 5	
otherwise if the properties is inherited use the value of the parent element generally the computed value



190149
prng random
Pattern(s): 3	1	
in your case i d consider using a large prng 32 bit or larger to shuffle your 10 000 numbers and then send the numbers out in the shuffled order
once they re used up you can shuffle again - since the prng is so large you ll be able to go through the 10k numbers many times before duplicating a sequence



190745
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 3	
100 concurrent users consuming 10 cpu does not mean 500 concurrent at 50 it could be 20 or it could be 100
your bottleneck could be processors or memory or network bandwidth



193952
superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	3	
call is for calling non-virtual static or superclass methods the target of the call is not subject to overriding
callvirt is for calling virtual methods so that if this is a subclassing that overrides the method the subclassing version is called instead



194248
lxml elementtree
Pattern(s): 5	
elementtree as in python 2.5 has only a small feature set compared to full-blown xml libraries but it s enough for many applications
if you need a validating parser or complete xpath support lxml is the way to go



194456
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 3	1	
edit i ll leave this answer here as a sort of theoretical reference point but it sounds like the autocompleter answer is likely to be more useful to you disclaimer although i work for google which clearly has suggest elements in various uis i haven t looked at any of the code around this area nor even spoken to anyone about the client-side aspect
the server-side language is probably irrelevant here



195398
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
postgresql does comply better with standards so it can be easier to replace later



196580
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 5	
from a raw performance perspective nginx is faster but not so much faster that i would include that as a determining factor
apache has the advantage in the area of modules available and the fact that it is pretty much standard



197420
pthreads fork
Pattern(s): 5	
having said this i would not use this code - i would either be inclined to fork mklink or look at the native library from jruby jpython sorry i cant look it up atm as my network connection is flakey
i seem to recall that jruby has written a library that wraps up various pthreads apis into java thinks like chown that are required for ruby compliance but are not cross platform



197437
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	1	
thus suppose you wanted a coupon for user 23 worth 200 you might build up a string like 23_200 and calculate an md5 hash with a secret salt of billthelizard to get 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 thus the complete code you give the customer is 200_23_2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 now when you received the code you break it apart and check that md5 200_23 +secret 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 to verify the value edit if an 32 character hash is too long you could always truncate it chopping it down to 8 chars would still give you 4294967296 different hash values



197437
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	1	
thus suppose you wanted a coupon for user 23 worth 200 you might build up a string like 23_200 and calculate an md5 hash with a secret salt of billthelizard to get 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 thus the complete code you give the customer is 200_23_2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 now when you received the code you break it apart and check that md5 200_23 +secret 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 to verify the value edit if an 32 character hash is too long you could always truncate it chopping it down to 8 chars would still give you 4294967296 different hash values



198473
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
get or query string posts are really good for information required for either bookmarking a particular item or for assisting in search engine optimization and indexing items
post is good for standard forms used to submit one time data



198607
xna slimdx
Pattern(s): 1	5	3	
xna provides several math constants including 3d specialists like pi 2 etc. and some advanced math functions with float precision though not the trigonometric functions
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big



200235
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 1	
i tried the first alpha version current is 3 of the flex builder under ubuntu and it was just okay but not useable for productive just alpha flashdevelop works only under windows maybe with wine.
and in my opinion it s not a good ide fdt is on eye level with the flex builder but also not free and i don t know if it runs innately on linux



200341
jar war
Pattern(s): 3	1	
heck you can store content directly in a war file which is basically a jar file with a few extra bits
yes you may need to write a custom resolver to use classloader.getresourceasstream but basically as you re given the ability to generate the content however you like fetching it from a jar file seems perfectly reasonable



200715
xslt xquery
Pattern(s): 5	3	1	
xslt is an example of a functional programming language for doing transformations of data or documents represented as xml -- admittedly a very verbose and very limited one
if i remember correctly xquery is also purely functional



201298
configobj configparser
Pattern(s): 3	5	
configobj is essentially a replacement for configparser with support for nested sections and much more



201835
ienumerable ilist
Pattern(s): 5	
by using ilist you make this a requirement so that nobody can inadvertently return an ienumerable



203242
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	5	
in short single table inherited sti is a design pattern that allows a mapping of oop inherited relationships to the database
if you define any subclassing from your activerecord model objects then you should consider sti



203444
prng random
Pattern(s): 6	1	
normally seeding a new state takes quite while for a serious prng and making new ones each time won t really help much. the only case i can think of where you might want more than one prng is for different systems say in a casino game you have one generator for shuffling cards and a separate one to generate comments done by the computer control characters this way really dedicated users can t guess outcomes based on character behaviors
a nice solution for seeding is to use this random.org they supply random numbers generated from the atmospheric noise for free



203550
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 5	
or if you really want to use gcc add -lstdc++ to the command line like so gcc test.cpp -lstdc++ running md5 against the a.out produced under each scenario shows that it s the same output
but yeah g++ probably makes your world a simpler place



204777
union distinct
Pattern(s): 3	
union - when the object returned by this method is enumerated union enumerates first and second in that order and yields each element that has not already been yielded
edit i ve moved distinct to preserving order based on this implementation



206345
int boolean
Pattern(s): 5	5	1	1	
a boolean is about truth and falseness
an int is about whole numbers



206964
soappy suds
Pattern(s): 1	
has a module called soappy which is different than soapy above
newer libraries suds very pythonic and easy to create wsdl-consuming soap clients

Pattern(s): 1	5	5	
google-chrome is a general term for the ui of a browser
firefox also has the word google-chrome all over its code base



207937
concurrenthashmap readwritelock
Pattern(s): 3	
if a map-type structure is more appropriate you can use a concurrenthashmap
with a list a readwritelock is probably the most effective way



208011
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 1	
the root passwd is disabled and people have to use sudo to get root access



210685
post put
Pattern(s): 1	
doing this violates my resource-oriented architecture but it conforms to the less restrictive rules of rest. in short replacing put delete in favor of post makes the api harder to read and put delete calls are no longer idempotent



210685
post get
Pattern(s): 1	
restful web services chapter 8 section overloading post reads if you want to do without put and delete altogether it s entirely restful to expose safe operations on resources through get and all other operations through overloaded post
doing this violates my resource-oriented architecture but it conforms to the less restrictive rules of rest. in short replacing put delete in favor of post makes the api harder to read and put delete calls are no longer idempotent



215617
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 1	
your best bet is to get a java cpuid utility that gives you the processors information and then match it against a table you ll have to generate that gives you the threads per core that the processors manages without a real context switch

safari has native svg support for images and fonts since version 3.1
camino contains native svg support as per its own documentation google-chrome uses an old version of web kit to support svg natively konqueror has svg support via a plugin ksvg2 from 2007 a here is a list of the state of svg support in many browsers



216153
haskell scheme
Pattern(s): 3	1	
it s not too widely used but definitely seems like a solid language to use especially considering the robustness of drscheme which in fact compiles scheme programs to native binary code
after that - haskell is incredibly interesting



217361
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 1	1	
since dictionary t t implements ienumerable you could use linq as so edit actually you may be able to use dictionary directly as if it doesn t map key value the way you want you can always go back to linq



217672
inherited properties
Pattern(s): 1	
inherited generally maps to an is-a relationship
since your container is a list but with some other things i would inherit from list and add your additional properties to your subclassing

219124
fastcgi scgi
Pattern(s): 4	5	
from my experience only fastcgi really works and it can be used in apache either via mod_fastcgi or if you can run a separate python daemon with mod_proxy_fcgi
wsgi is a protocol much like cgi which defines a set of rules how webserver and python code can interact it is defined as pep333



219490
sqldatasource objectdatasource
Pattern(s): 5	
my understanding is that with sqldatasource connection management is performed for you and you have nothing to fear
objectdatasource doesn t talk to the database directly in the first place so it will be safe -- as long as the underlying object performs its connection and reader management correctly



222347
post get
Pattern(s): 3	
into the code will throw an exception that will not get handled
the second version from the original post does not have this problem and it is generally preferred



223288
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 5	3	1	
if javascript validation didn t work for any reason regular server-side validation scenario page reload with error informations takes place using the same server-side script
this solution isn t as responsive as pure client-side validation needs time to send receive data between client and server but is quite simple and you don t need to translate validation rules to javascript



227544
try-catch exception-handling
Pattern(s): 1	
to me that programmer and quality overhead is the primary argument against using try-catch for process flow
the computer overhead of exception-handling is insignificant in comparison and usually tiny in terms of the application s ability to meet real-world performance requirements



228349
uinavigationcontroller uinavigationbar
Pattern(s): 5	
i believe the uinavigationcontroller assumes that your controller view frames don t include the area beneath the navigation bar
uibarstyleblacktranslucent is more often used for uitoolbar so apple probably didn t make it easy to use it nicely with uinavigationbar



228349
uinavigationcontroller uinavigationbar
Pattern(s): 5	
you ll probably need to abandon the uinavigationcontroller or start hacking the frames careful with rotations if you want to reliably render under the bar area
also if your intention is to hide the navigation bar after a few seconds you ll have a much easier time if you make it fade out like the photos app instead of trying to slide it up like mobile safari



229451
gif png
Pattern(s): 4	3	
i see that the gimp manual states his png8 format like gif uses only one bit for transparency



229736
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 3	
somehow the for-loop is mostly designed to run a number of times know in advance you can still use break to terminate early so the dynamic evaluation of the stop term is more annoying than useful if you really need dynamic evaluation you use or
on some other languages like lua the stop condition is evaluated only once at loops init



230208
daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 5	1	3	
so far we ve had zero issues as a result of this process except when the build server kicks in while our source control systemd also known as the daemons spawn see so many of my recent remarks performs a large multi-file check-in
as daemons spawn doesn t support transacted check-ins. however this is a very rare occurrence -- perhaps once every 5 or 6 weeks



232756
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
if you can consistently reproduce the problem with specific input parameters you should debug like this first debug to the precise free that causes the problem
then figure out when the memory that is about to be free d was malloc ed



233457
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
it replaces all the permissions set in order to set only the ones defined in the command so after the command accessing files resulted in a access denied even with my admin user it applied on the c windows directory while i called the command from the wwwroot folder
so after some tests the right command is t applies on specified folder and subfolders e edits the acl instead of replacing it



235727
nemerle boo
Pattern(s): 4	
a key factor for linq is the ability of the compiler to generate expression trees. i am using a macro in nemerle that converts a given nemerle expression into an expression tree object. i can then pass this to the where select etc extension methods on iqueryables. it s not quite the syntax of c# and vb but it s close enough for me
i got the nemerle macro via a link on this post it should be possible to create a similar macro for boo



236111
free malloc
Pattern(s): 5	3	
on linux with glibc the memory is actually always returned to the os above a certain size glibc malloc uses mmap for big allocations controlled by mmap_threshold and in that case free calls munmap which frees automatically the reserved memory
below that threshold it uses brk and free does not return the memory in that case



237818
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	5	
this basically adds a .git folder to the current directory
this is like using visualsvn creating a new repository then checking it out to a working directory just without the server vim myfile.txt - make a new file if you have existing files you obviously can skip this git add myfile.txt - start tracking the new file similar to svn add ing a file git commit - commits whatever you have run git add on



238937
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
i use it in a class tree which serializable to a xml file
on the deserialization the parser class returns a pointer to the base class which has a enumeration for the type of the subclass because you don t know which type it is until you parse it



240272
post put
Pattern(s): 3	
therefore post is not considered safe or idempotent



241908
octal hex
Pattern(s): 1	
so octal became popular because it allowed you to think in groups of three bits and you could use symbols we are familiar with as numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
but groups of four which is another power of 2 gives the humans a lot more mental computing power than octal hex is based on 4 bits which is also a power of 2



241908
octal binary
Pattern(s): 3	3	1	1	1	
even a simple task for a human in binary is long winded simple second grade math is still a lot of ones and zeros
so octal became popular because it allowed you to think in groups of three bits and you could use symbols we are familiar with as numbers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7



242348
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 3	
the other major thing to watch out for is that innodb does not support fulltext indices nor insert delayed
but then myisam doesn t support referential integrity



243197
redmine bugzilla
Pattern(s): 1	
it is open source ajax enabled email interface scm integration integrated wiki configurable trackers workflow and roles rss and email notifications i have used jira too hard bugzilla too rubbish and fogbugz too expensive and i think redmine is fantastic



244233
octal hex
Pattern(s): 1	
hex maps 4 bits to one hex nibble 0-f so a byte is stored in two nibbles 00-ff
octal was popular on digital equipment dec and other older machines but one octal digit maps to three bits so it doesn t cross byte boundaries as nicely



244240
put get
Pattern(s): 5	
usability notes personally i hate when sites put the forgot password or forgot username or help links inbetween the password field and the login button
as a keyboard user i shouldn t have to tab over them to get to the submit button



245871

Pattern(s): 5	
you may need to upgrade to the most recent versioning of jython or eclipse
but it s quite possible they haven t yet released a versioning that supports this os



246649
vb.net vb6
Pattern(s): 3	3	
the reason for this is you already know the syntax and that vb.net is not enough like vb6 to make it as easy a move as you might expect

cobertura eclemma
Pattern(s): 1	5	
i use a combination of cobertura checkstyle ecl emma and findbugs
eclemma is an awesome eclipse plugin that shows the code coverage by coloring the java source in the editor screenshot - the coverage is generated by running a junit test



248757
sudo passwd
Pattern(s): 1	5	
edit looks like sudo has a nopasswd mode so i think it should work since you re running the programs as external commands



249498
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
integers are stored with the right-most bit being 1 and each bit to the left being double that 2 4 8 ...
it s easy to see that this can store any int up to 2 n where n is the number of bits



249511
datediff difference
Pattern(s): 5	
with one-digit accuracy this won t make much difference but do not try to calculate new dates based on the resulting value as they will not be 100 accurate
i ll try and find a way to format that more nicely... this yields 8.3 the formula takes into account that between 2008-04-13 and 2008-11-05 datediff mm ... returns 7 but really it is not seven months in between but less



251023
cvs svn
Pattern(s): 5	
they would have to access code via our svn and would be unlikely to get paid without meeting unit testing and code review requirements
if contracting i d make sure to have solid experience of both vss check-in out and cvs merge conflict models



251773
switching screens
Pattern(s): 0	
it makes it easier for the user to arrange their workspace and switching between documents using the os s app switching capabilities
a lot of mdi applications prevent this by corraling multiple documents into the same window which limits usability of screens real estate in a multiple monitor scenario



252122
versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
support of multiple server versioning means design and implementation of multiple versioning of parsers and related infra in parallel. this multiplies time and cost to develop test and support
at the same time the core module is an important product base that enables not only intellisense feature but also other products including upgrade advisor to analyze scripts



252733
goto break
Pattern(s): 5	
in c# you can still have one case fall through to another - you just have to make the fall thru explicit by jumping to the next case using a goto
it s too bad java didn t take the opportunity to break from the c semantics



253390
cvs svn
Pattern(s): 5	
for cvs pycvs may be worth a look
for svn there is pysvn which is pretty good



253463
redmine trac
Pattern(s): 5	5	
with trac you can have multi-project setups as well having a separate environment for each project but in the end it s a workaround
redmine has builtin support for multi-project environments



253740
hash md5
Pattern(s): 1	0	3	
actually all other aspects being equal a slower hash function is more secure than a fast one
this is because a slower hash function results in slower generation of rainbow tables and slower brute forcing or dictionary attacks on the password
from thomas ptacek at as referenced in this coding horror article the problem is that md5 is fast



254130
mouse keyboard
Pattern(s): 4	
however i think most flash developers and especially those who make games rely on the fact that keyboard input is caught by the flash application regardless of where the mouse is



255743
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	5	
if what you want is to inherited the behavior of an array it s usually a better idea to do that with a has-a relationship rather than an is-a
that is to write a class that has an nsarray instance variable and simply forwards the relevant messages to it



256099
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 3	1	0	5	3	
but the server-side part is pretty simple
the client-side part is trickier i think
i found this article helpful he s writing things in php but the client side work is pretty much the same



256521
skip-lists tree
Pattern(s): 5	
from the wikipedia article you quoted θ n operations which force us to visit every node in ascending order such as printing the entire list provide the opportunity to perform a behind-the-scenes derandomization of the level structure of the skip-lists in an optimal way bringing the skip-lists to o log n search time
... a skip-lists upon which we have not recently performed any such θ n operations does not provide the same absolute worst-case performance guarantees as more traditional balanced tree data structures because it is always possible though with very low probability that the coin-flips used to build the skip-lists will produce a badly balanced structure edit so it s a trade-off skip lists use less memory at the risk that they might degenerate into an unbalanced tree

there s also wicket a very decent comparison of wicket and tapestry is available here



257953
width height
Pattern(s): 3	0	3	1	
safari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height
of course if there aren t any hard width values then the design is a liquid layout so the concern about designing for a particular width is somewhat altered



258093
awt swing
Pattern(s): 1	8	
i don t think that awt is capable of restyling native component peers in a reliable fashion
i know for certain that swt can t and it s a far more sophisticated toolkit than awt
this is part of why it was essentially deprecated in favor of swing back in java 1.2



260148
lxml libxml2
Pattern(s): 1	
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well



260148
lxml elementtree
Pattern(s): 1	
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well

keydown keyup
Pattern(s): 5	1	
keydown is the moment the key is pushed down. keyup is after the key has been released



260972
strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 5	1	5	
it makes sense to use strncpy over strcpy for safety if you don t know the source string will fit inside the destination buffer
however strncpy has a major performance issue in that it always writes the amount of bytes specified for the size



261159
public protected
Pattern(s): 1	3	5	
define all your constructors protected making them public is pointless anyway your subclass constructor s can call one constructor of the abstract class
it may even have to call it if there is no no-arg constructor in the abstract class in any case don t forget that if you don t define a constructor then the compiler will automatically generate one for you this one is public has no argument and does nothing



261277
boost stl
Pattern(s): 5	
boost has a utility called next and its inverse prior for just that purpose
i recommend nicola bonelli s answer to be accepted. that s part of the stl and doesn t require using boost if your code doesn t use boost thanks to the commenters for pointing this out

the standard name for timing the execution of expressions in most scheme implementations is time
here is an example from within racket



264473
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	5	1	
sqlite runs in-process with the client application no network capability very low query overhead because of this potentially rather fast for easy queries because there is less ipc system calls and data copying to do
very limited concurrency i think it s either one writer or multiple readers per database file mysql far more features choice of engines innodb provides good features for many workloads much more control of storage backup restore etc network-capable - which allows its use in large scale applications better concurrency - the innodb engine has mvcc which means that readers do not block writers nor do writers block readers
even the old myisam engine has table-level locking rather than for the whole database as sqlite

265372
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
asp.net validation controls also provide two ways of validation server-side or client-side
the nice thing about these validation controls is that it will preform client-side validation when it detects the browser is able unless client-side validation has been disabled



267096
implements extends
Pattern(s): 5	
if your abstract class is the only class that will ever implements the interface then you can always just check for instances of the abstract class you don t need the interface
but if you want to be future-compatible with new classes not yet written which will not extends the abstract class but could use the interface then keep using the interface now



267099
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 5	5	
to add to what others have said g++ is the gnu c++ compiler
gcc is the gnu compiler collection not the gnu c compiler as many people assume



268287
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	0	5	
there is a cost to designing for inherited it can pin down your implementation you have to declare which methods are going to call which other methods in case a user overrides one but not the other it reveals your implementation rather than just the effects it means you have to think of more possibilities when designing things like equals are hard to design in an inherited tree it requires more documentation an immutable type which is subclassing may become mutable ick item 17 of effective java goes into more details on this - regardless of the fact that it s written in the context of java the advice applies to .net as well

that makes a bit-count of at least 16 for short and int and 32 for long
for chars it states explicitly that it should have at least 8 bits char_bit . c++ inherits those rules for the limits.h file so in c++ we have the same fundamental requirements for those values

post get
Pattern(s): 1	
without testing it or even trying to compile it i would do something like also here s a link to a blog post that achieves the same accross web applications
and finally a word of advice you ll get better search results if you use programmatically instead of code wise



273855
punctuation words
Pattern(s): 5	
for your particular case i think comparing the search to real words sounds like the way to go with a words list like that
the alternative styles punctuation require a bit more work but i doubt users will use that often enough to be an issue



276151
ssl https
Pattern(s): 5	
------ previous answer ------------ ssl hosts must be tied to a unique ip address port combination thus you cannot use virtual hosting or at least it can only have one ssl host per ip address
this is due to the fact that https begins encryption before the host parameter is sent in http and thus it cannot determine which cipher to use from the hostname - all it has is the ip address



277233
g++ gcc
Pattern(s): 1	1	
when executing gcc from the command line g++ is the c++ compiler while gcc is the general c compiler



277452
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	5	
myisam uses a data file and an index file for each table stored in a directory named after the database
innodb seems to lump everything together in a file called ibdata1

versioning upgrade
Pattern(s): 3	
most of the time the download is a setup program created by innosetup which updates the users system and database to the latest versioning
when a new paid upgrade is needed i then send the user to a purchase upgrade form

jboss weblogic
Pattern(s): 1	
i do not think jboss is bad in anyway it simply isn t as up-to-date
most of my experience is on weblogic but i have used jboss and glassfish



279287
folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	
if you structure your project this way src __init__.py main.py dirfoo __init__.py foo.py dirbar __init__.py bar.py then from foo.py you should be able to do import dirfoo.foo or from dirfoo.foo import fooobject per tom s comment this does require that the src folder is accessible either via site_packages or your search path
also as he mentions __init__.py is implicitly imported when you first import a module in that package directory

mousemove mouseleave
Pattern(s): 1	
mousemove is the correct event in vb6
you ll have to do some work to manually detect when the mouseleave the client area cleanly

phpunit simpletest
Pattern(s): 7	
phpunit seems to have a bigger userbase which may count as an argument for switching
i m quite happy with simpletest though



280900
vbscript vba
Pattern(s): 3	3	
vbscript works quite well with the jet engine
however i do not see why you say it is not possible to export a query to a csv file from within access. sub transfercsv docmd.transfertext acexportdelim putnameofqueryhere c putpathand filenamehere.csv true end sub is the usual way in vba



281024
ubuntu centos
Pattern(s): 1	5	
fedora and ubuntu use totally different package managers so you won t be able to easily do it in any sort of generic way
in centos which is redhat enterprise edition with the serial numbers filed off and so therefore pretty close to fedora we did this using kickstart files



282162
phpunit simpletest
Pattern(s): 3	1	
read the tutorials on how to write and run tests on the homepage of phpunit
it is quite easy and well described



284711
uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller
Pattern(s): 1	1	5	5	1	5	
in general your application should have a tab controller one of who s tab s loads a uinavigationcontroller which in turn loads it s views - not that both maintain management over the different views
it is also improper to refer to the display of a uiviewcontroller as such an object doesn t have a visual representation



284851
junit testng
Pattern(s): 1	
in either case segmenting out the tests as both testng and junit do is helpful with integration tests too



285627
cvs svn
Pattern(s): 4	3	
it isn t a static entity like a cvs tag is well to be fair you can move a tag on individual cvs files which effectively changes it



285809
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 3	3	
if the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialversionuid than that of the corresponding sender s class then deserialization will result in an invalidclassexception
a serializable class can declare its own serialversionuid explicitly by declaring a field named serialversionuid that must be static final and of type long if a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialversionuid then the serializable runtime will calculate a default serialversionuid value for that class based on various aspects of the class as described in the java tm object serializable specification



286303
swt swing
Pattern(s): 3	5	1	
it depends with eclipse 3.4 swt 3.4 is quite supported with macos
now swt is os specific and you may not have the same flexibility than swing so you need to have good reason for looking for an alternative to swing especially when you consider there are good lafs look and feel for java



288615
hash md5
Pattern(s): 3	1	
as of 2017 there s no research that comes even close to feasibility so even a determined well-funded attacker can t compute a url that would hash to a hash of any existing url in your database
the only known collision attack against md5 is not useful for attacking url-like keys



289061
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are working on octal you can simply if you are working on hex you can simply but for decimal you should probably do it the way jesse beder suggests most systems have a fast int divide
if you re working on a system that doesn t you could use the double dabble algorithm to fast convert to bcd



289891
public protected
Pattern(s): 5	
protected and private are not an essential part of good encapsulation
you can do good design with everything being public that s the way python works for example



290253
int boolean
Pattern(s): 1	
a tinyint is an 8-bit int value a bit field can store between 1 bit bit 1 and 64 bits bit 64
for a boolean values bit 1 is pretty common

a tinyint is an 8-bit int value a bit field can store between 1 bit bit 1 and 64 bits bit 64
for a boolean values bit 1 is pretty common



290553
inherited properties
Pattern(s): 3	1	
was its support for mixin inherited - the methods from any other classes could be reused in your class
as long as your class provided the properties that these methods used it worked just fine and there was no diamond problem or other multiple-inheritance gotchas to worry about

post-doc haskell programmer from uustalu vene and pardo s recursion scheme from comonads 4 tenured professor teaching haskell to freshmen



290894
rss feed
Pattern(s): 3	
there s no reason to have multiple formats for a site available and any modern feed client can now parse atom feed
atom has quite a few technical advantages over rss and is being widely supported and utilized by major companies such as google and microsoft



293323
put get
Pattern(s): 5	
weekly progress reports once a week take half an hour to put together a simple report that covers the following achievements assumptions dependancies issues resolutions it shouldn t take much effort to do this and it will give you a very good insight into how the project is tracking



294744
cassini iis
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are debugging locally using the light weight web server cassini you can apply this trick to cassini itself
if you are debuggin directly on a web server though inside of iis i don t know how to get this trick to work but hopefully it will lead you in the right direction



294983
vsts tfs
Pattern(s): 5	
you could write your own vsts-style extensions using the existing vs api which say uses a config file for the authentication credentials as the tfs api does support authentication through a manually-created user we have an external application at work which authenticates against our tfs server and is used by employees of our many offices on different domains



295657
sorting filtering
Pattern(s): 3	
of course if those additional clauses go anywhere near user text input you have to sanitize them to prevent sql injection attacks. the database can filtering faster than any other tier in general because using a where clause on the database will often allow the database to avoid even reading the unnecessary records off the disk which is several orders of magnitude slower than anything you can do with the cpu
sorting is often faster on the db as well because the db can often do the joins in such a way that records are already sorted in the order you want them

299702
put get
Pattern(s): 5	
from understanding weak references by ethan nicholas weak references a weak reference simply put is a reference that isn t strong enough to force an object to remain in memory. weak references allow you to leverage the garbage collector s ability to determine reachability for you so you don t have to do it yourself
you create a weak reference like this and then elsewhere in the code you can use weakwidget.get to get the actual widget object



300837
unsigned short
Pattern(s): 5	
but the problem with this approach is that you cast from unsigned char to void and then to some different type
the standard doesn t guarantee the address remains the same and in addition dereferencing that pointer would be undefined behavior



300851
integer unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
please see additional documentation in the php manual the size of an integer is platform-dependent although a maximum value of about two billion is the usual value that s 32 bits signed
php does not support unsigned integers



300861
floating-point integer
Pattern(s): 3	
however these only go so far if you add a large integer to a large integer php will see that the result is too big to fit into a normal integer and will assign it to a floating-point number
floating-point numbers floats themselves only go so high however and there s a point around the sixteen-digit mark where php will just lose the plot entirely



301746
cpython ironpython
Pattern(s): 5	
everyone else seems to have the cpython - sql server side covered
if you want to use ironpython you can use the standard ado.net api to talk to the database if you ve already got ironpython you don t need to install anything else



304143
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 4	
sadly and its counterpart are last i checked only recognized by kvo for set as in nsset properties not array properties so you don t get free kvo notifications with them unless you implement them on top of accessor it does recognize

i did some testing with strings a while ago with ie7 opera and firefox
opera took only 0.4s to perform the test but ie7 hadn t finished after 20 minutes



304880
maven m2e
Pattern(s): 1	5	
along with the m2e plugin for eclipse managing dependencies becomes a doddle - it has an excellent dependency visualisation tool
overall i would say maven is a great tool starting out on a project but may start to lose its way once your build begins to gain complexity



305596
vbscript vba
Pattern(s): 5	
the code is as follows and then the c# code changing the vba to read aclink rather than acimport should allow linking
edit re comments i cannot help with c# but here is some vbscript that links a table from one mdb to another



306053
ostream ostringstream
Pattern(s): 5	
because it s a temporary we cannot trivially convert to an ostream object through casting
both the constructor obviously and str are class ostringstream methods. yes we need to use .str



308480
maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
since 2.0.9 default versions are provided by the super pom.xml for most important plugins dependency plug-in included so 2.0 version will be downloaded which has list goal
or you can try removing the cached version of the plug-in from the repository .m2 repository org maven plugins maven-dependency-plugin where is the user home directory

that is the np in np-hard does not mean non-deterministic polynomial time



314719
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	5	
now django implements inherited using a onetoonefield
because of this an instance of a base class that has a subclassing instance gets a reference to that instance named appropriately



316491
vbscript jscript
Pattern(s): 3	3	
one of which is the ability to include external script files of both the vbscript and jscript flavors
i never got very deep into it but i think it would do what you re wanting to do. you can include javascript vbscript or modules of other wscript script languages



317990
crypt hash
Pattern(s): 0	5	
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords



317990
crypt md5
Pattern(s): 0	0	5	5	
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords



317990
crypt salt
Pattern(s): 0	5	
by computing a hash from a visitor-supplied string plus some salt of course i can tell whether the user provided the same password twice without the security risk of allowing my application to be able to decrypt the provided password possibly maliciously
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords



317990
hash md5
Pattern(s): 0	5	
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords



318010
hash salt
Pattern(s): 3	
some applications require the user s password to be retrievable as opposed to a system where the user s password is randomly reset to something if forgotten because it cannot be decrypted because you re using a hash
also keep with the suggestion of using a salt value whether you hash or encrypt



318829
jsf seam
Pattern(s): 3	1	
hibernate + jsf is a very common combination
but if you are asking about using jsf managed beans with a jpa framework have a look at seam



320181
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	3	
it is easy to remove the sealed tag if the class needs to change to allow inherited in the future
however if you want to change a class which is already being used as a base class for some other type you risk breaking the subclassing when you change the base class



322081
getter setter
Pattern(s): 1	3	1	
the dbkey property getter is virtual in the il because it is in an interface
the setter is not virtual because it is not part of the interface but part of the concrete class



322088
serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
when you make a change that breaks serialization or deserialization this test will fail
the only thing checking the xml data is going to find for you is if your serializable is emitting a superset of what the deserializer requires and the deserializer silently ignores stuff it doesn t expect



322330
prepare execute
Pattern(s): 4	
the scenario in which you would get benefit from a prepare query is when you prepare it and execute it many times during the same php request



322875
floating-point fixed-point
Pattern(s): 5	
source wikipedia double precision for a detailed description of how floating point values are handled in java see the section 4.2.3 floating-point types formats and values of the java language specification
the byte char int long types are fixed-point numbers which are exact representions of numbers



323221
inherited properties
Pattern(s): 3	1	
to talk to the same instance between appdomains it must inherited from marshalbyrefobject
done this way every method call to the object including properties etc is actually a remoting call to the other app-domain



323809
firefox safari
Pattern(s): 5	
as the others said you can use firebug and that will sort you out no worries on firefox
chrome safari both have a built-in developer console which has an almost identical interface to firebug s console so your code should be portable across those browsers



324087
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 3	3	
if i were you i would never rely on any version of any filesystems driver be it microsoft s be it another os s to be consistent about the algorithm it uses to generate short file names
the exact behavior of the microsoft fastfat and ntfs drivers is not officially documented except as somewhat high level overviews thus are not part of the api contract



324355
lxml libxml2
Pattern(s): 0	3	1	
also libxml2 has more features
lxml is mostly api compatible with xml.etree.elementtree



326637
gridview objectdatasource
Pattern(s): 5	
all of the datakey values will always be passed to the delete method because the fields named by datakeynames are intended to be the field or fields that uniquely identify that item in the gridview
they re often used for more than that to easily maintain extra fields on a per-row basis in viewstate as you are here but doing so has the side-effect that you re seeing with the objectdatasource methods



327402
prng random
Pattern(s): 5	
what you want to do is to have an uniform random generated but restricted to a certain range in this case an entropy of 4
if your prng has say an entropy of 32-bit you cannot be certain that computing the output mod 4 will work as expected



328797
ienumerable ilist
Pattern(s): 5	
this makes the interfaces similar in name only while icollection and ienumerable t differ by very little
from this list the only non-generic classes that don t have a generic counterpart are bitarray and caseinsensitivecomparer



328797
ienumerable icollection
Pattern(s): 1	1	1	1	5	
this makes the interfaces similar in name only while icollection and ienumerable t differ by very little
from this list the only non-generic classes that don t have a generic counterpart are bitarray and caseinsensitivecomparer



329243
division addition
Pattern(s): 0	
since most processors can do an addition comparison or multiplication in a single cycle those are all counted as one flop
but division always takes longer

330999
cvs svn
Pattern(s): 3	
svn was designed explicitly to be a better cvs



331283
crypt md5
Pattern(s): 3	
note that this is a gnu extension to crypt see man crypt on a linux system
md5 and now even sha1 may be broken but they are still relatively good for password hash and md5 is still the standard for linux local passwords



332975
profiling instrumentation
Pattern(s): 5	
aqtime is an instrumenting profiling
instrumenting profilers often aren t suitable for measuring code time particularly in microbenchmarks like yours because the cost of the instrumentation often outweighs the cost of the thing being measured



333305
icmp udp
Pattern(s): 5	
it allows for tcp pings like the standard ruby ping but also udp http and icmp pings
an icmp ping requires root privileges but the others do not



333631
webkit gecko
Pattern(s): 3	3	5	
with gecko-engined browsers you get in terms of other browsers implementing these features i m only aware of webkit implementing array extras but it s actually quite easy to monkeypatch support for those in all browsers since they re just additional methods
gecko opera and webkit also support the canvas element which although being a new html element is used via javascript so i m not sure if that fits your criteria



333723
opera firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
both opera and firefox support some css3



335122
pascal delphi
Pattern(s): 5	5	
i don t think there are any machine code decompilers that produce pascal code
most delphi decompilers parse form and rtti data but do not actually decompile the machine code



335379
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 1	
happily sql server 2008 allows you to have your cake and eat it too with the filestream attribute in sql server 2008 you can apply the filestream attribute to a varbinary column and sql server then stores the data for that column on the local ntfs filesystems
storing the data on the filesystems brings two key benefits performance matches the streaming performance of the filesystems



338821
wordpress joomla
Pattern(s): 5	3	1	
however using joomla can be difficult at first as its content organization is rather complex
if the site would consist of basic blog-like webpages then wordpress is the way to go
wordpress is a very simple blogging cms with a huge user community



338821
wordpress joomla
Pattern(s): 3	1	4	1	
wordpress is a very simple blogging cms with a huge user community
it s very easy to use has many plugins for it and the newest version of wordpress even has auto-updating features
wordpress isn t as good as joomla when it comes to user management though



339988
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
setting the folder search paths in the visual studio settings to fix an include issue is generally not really a good idea from a design point of view
your code will be less portable to different machines with different directory lay-outs. br my suggestion would be to settle on an organisation of your code so that the relative paths of the sub-directories relative to your including code are fixed add the base folder to the project project properties - configuration properties - c c++ - additional include directory additional include directory add the subdirectories to the #include statements #include subdirectory somefile.h



343465
post put
Pattern(s): 5	
a put to that identifier means replace your information with mine
post adds information and delete eliminates information



346183
public protected
Pattern(s): 3	1	5	5	
don t assume that the goal should be to keep all variables private. in cases of inheritance making variables as protected is usually a good alternative
rather than marking all instance data public you create getter setter for those that need to be accessed to the outside world



346953
width margin
Pattern(s): 5	
by default divs are block elements and take up the entire width of their parent - in this case the entire document propagating through the #outer div so the automatic margin style has no effect



348516
filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 3	
one other note if you are using ntfs based storage windows server etc you might consider finding a way around putting thousands and thousands of files in one directory
i am not sure why but sometimes the filesystems does not cope well with that situation

codeigniter cakephp
Pattern(s): 5	5	
codeigniter gives you the most elbowroom of the first three
doesn t exactly enforce oop it leaves it up to you



354067
inherited properties
Pattern(s): 5	1	5	
i wouldn t create a publisher class to inherited book since publisher isn t a book it is metadata information about a book. the bible though would inherited book
my advice would be to create a publisher properties on the book. this publisher could be of type ipublishinformation and the string publisher could use a namedpublisher string name class implementing ipublishinformation



354253
mergesort timsort
Pattern(s): 1	
a galloping mergesort such as python s built-in sort c.f
timsort has good expected performance when there are large runs of already-sorted data like in your example identical objects -- you ll skip o log n work per merge



354405
implements extends
Pattern(s): 5	
i agree with jeebee consider implements your helper methods somewhere other than an abstract base class
if your helper method commony only exists in abstract base class b all classes which implement interface a will have to also extends base class b in order to take advantage of that implementation of commony



355064
trie tree
Pattern(s): 1	
to store a word like stackoverflow insert into trie path values s st sta stac stack stacko stackov stackove stackover stackover stackoverf stackoverflo stackoverflow
the materialized path in the tree is the prefixed sequence of characters itself



355405
folder directory
Pattern(s): 5	
generally when i configure iis i set the properties for the default web site to a folder that doesn t contain anything then create individual entries within iis for each web site
for example you would create a new entry for myapplication.com and set its home directory to the proper folder on the server that contains your root files usually c inetpub wwwroot myapplication.com but it could be anywhere you like



355552
haskell scheme
Pattern(s): 3	0	
but haskell is a bit trickier in that you can attempt to redefine a variable within the same scope but instead you just introduce another recursion equation
this is a pitfall for people who learned ml or scheme first this is perfectly good ml or scheme let but haskel has scheme letrec semantics without the restriction to lambda values



355768
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 1	
that is why effective java and others say you should favour delegation before inherited if possible
i think krosenvold s solution sounds clean



356028
range max
Pattern(s): 3	1	
yep easily possible just make sure you re covering the times in your indexes to pull it based purely off the dates a small amount of trickery is required due to sphinx requiring a bounded range x..y as opposed to x y
the use of min max value is very inelegant but i m not aware of a good way around it at the moment



356920
google-chrome safari
Pattern(s): 1	3	
google-chrome uses webkit a fairly standard rendering engine
safari uses it also and it doesn t sound like webkit is going away



359392
x86 64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
it s your com component is housed in a com server ie a seperate process then you won t need to do anything special as the com subsystem will remote your calls from your x64 app to the x86 app and back again
if your component is an in-process com component then you ll have to rethink things as a 64bit process can t use 32 bit in process com components



360276
ssl https
Pattern(s): 1	1	
libcurl is a free and easy-to-use client-side url transfer library supporting ftp ftps http https scp sftp tftp telnet dict ldap ldaps and file
libcurl supports ssl certificates http post http put ftp uploading http form based upload proxies cookies user+password authentication basic digest ntlm negotiate kerberos4 file transfer resume http proxy tunneling and more



360494
cpu processors
Pattern(s): 0	1	
some of its strategies include passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors
active loadbalancing if there are 3 tasks 2 on one physical cpu and 1 on the other when the second physical processors goes idle the scheduler will attempt to migrate one of the tasks to it



360958
int double
Pattern(s): 5	
without really knowing what the problem is a few things look a bit odd also mixing decimal and int in a calculation can lead to unexpected results unless you really know what you are doing
i suggest using only decimals or double which are way faster and usually have enough precision for engineering computations



361157
uiviewcontroller uinavigationcontroller
Pattern(s): 1	
because the view owned by a uiviewcontroller fills the available space in its parent
its parent will be either a uiwindow or the view controlled by something like a uinavigationcontroller or uitabbarcontroller



361509
pop-up dialog
Pattern(s): 5	
modal dialog the evil form of dialog boxes in general constrain the user to only one action
some answers seem to misapprehend that it s any pop-up that asks for user confirmation



361949
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 3	
udp is often used for various types of realtime traffic that doesn t need strict ordering to be useful
this is because tcp enforces an ordering before passing data to an application by default you can get around this by setting the urg pointer but no one seems to ever do this and that can be highly undesirable in an environment where you d rather get current realtime data than get old data reliably

the working form is what is displayed to the user - it s just a container and can contain elements from various forms
various buttons on the form don t actually submit but call a form handler validation routine in javascript
the handler validation routine dynamically sets the action of the submission form and adds the required elements to that form dynamically so it can be submitted

post get
Pattern(s): 5	
you don t have support for team explorer and vs built in source control access in isolated shell see this post from vin though not directly related - if you are using vs sdk 1.1 to develop your packages - remember that the managed package framework is no longer available with the default distribution
so don t get surprised if your old packages can t load mpf files after moving to sdk 1.1

Pattern(s): 4	
and as a last remark i d make the methods protected
there s usually no reason at all to keep them public and reducing the number of public members keeps your public interface clean

stringbuilder stringwriter
Pattern(s): 3	1	
i suspect it s because it s writing to a stringbuilder which is inherently utf-16
an alternative to get round this is to create a class derived from stringwriter but which overrides the encoding property

inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
because python has multiple inherited you may also see something like this class someabstraction object pass # lots of stuff - but missing something class mixin1 object def something self pass # one implementation class mixin2 object def something self pass # another class concrete1 someabstraction mixin1 pass class concrete2 someabstraction mixin2 pass this uses a kind of abstract superclass with mixins to create concrete subclassing that are disjoint

maven pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
i don t know about artifactory but here are my reasons for using nexus dead simple install and since 1.2 dead simple upgrade too very good web ui easy to maintain almost no administrative overhead provides you with rss feed of recently installed broken artifacts and errors it can group several repositories so you can mirror several sources but need only one or two entries in your settings.xml deploying from maven works out of the box no need for webdav hacks etc
it s free you can redirect access paths some broken pom.xml requires a.b.c from xxx

haskell scheme
Pattern(s): 3	5	3	
examples the programming language scheme is dynamically typed aka duck-typed and it has many dozens of interpreted implementations but also some fine native-code compilers including larceny gambit and plt scheme which includes both an interpreter and a jit compiler making seamless transitions
the programming language haskell is statically typed

try-catch exception-handling
Pattern(s): 3	1	
for complex production-grade scenarios it is a horrible practice to have multiple try-catch statements and it is highly inflexible practice to have these statements within the business logic at all
windows cloud computing team their code has to be efficient and reliable seems to stick with the exception-handling handling action policies instead

this form also allows you to put the filtering clauses with the individual subquery and save the joining clauses for the final select
at work our development grouping generally finds them easier to maintain and frequently faster

post get
Pattern(s): 3	
for instance let s assume that you have a get request to a page which lets the user add an administrator to a site and the user clicks a link to a page which does a response.redirect username attackernamehere
while normally a post does not offer much protection against this nothing will stop someone from having a form method post action sharepoint has a concept of form digests which contain information about the previous request that is generating the post back including the user s name

salt md5
Pattern(s): 5	
if it s a well-known algorithm like md5 and someone can get hold of the hash output then on their own cpu time they can rapidly check against possible passwords and if they find a match then they ve got the password
adding salt prevents this kind of attack see the wikipedia article

bazaar svn
Pattern(s): 4	
hm the most popular is easily svn which an old-fashioned centralized system but it s a bit of a pain to set up imo
requires special software on the server. i personally am quite fond of bazaar which is distributed and a server repository only requires ftp access and nothing else on the server

updatepanel scriptmanager
Pattern(s): 5	
if you re a jquery fan you re probably using it already to do much of what you do with asp.net ajax so if you can consider getting rid of scriptmanager completely
if you can t do that or if you use updatepanel then link the jquery download to google this way for ver 1.2.6 google promotes linking this way to minimize the necessity to download jquery again and again

cpu processors
Pattern(s): 5	3	
so we ve an architectural instruction set or architectural machine code and an inner-level micro-instruction set which is hidden from the outer world. the trace cache of the intel processors was conceived to store such ops to optimize the superscalar performance of the processors as the cpu executes uops not the architectural instruction-set available for execution by programs



395751
inherited properties
Pattern(s): 5	
it also normally requires a lot of copy.copy ing to maintain inherited and to copy from class to instance and means you have to look in many places to see whats going on always looking from metaclass up which goes against the python grain also. i have been picking through formencode and sqlalchemy code to see if such a declarative style was worth it and its clearly not
such style should be left to descriptors such as properties and methods and immutable data. ruby has better support for such declarative styles and i am glad the core python language is not going down that route

perl tcl
Pattern(s): 1	
even when writing in c c++ i found a useful pattern was to embed a domain specific scripting language tcl though i don t much like that language
the actual choice of language is i think a religious choice though there are some tradeoffs that are obvious readability for example - perl is useful but is too easy to write cryptic scripts in

salt md5
Pattern(s): 6	
i usually use sha1 and salt with the user id or some other user-specific piece of information and sometimes i additionally use a constant salt so i have 2 parts to the salt
sha1 is now also considered somewhat compromised but to a far lesser degree than md5

416568
for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 6	
using a boolean for this purpose would also be good and you could even wire it into the condition of each for-loop
for example though if you re using more than two loops it might be more appropriate to wrap them in a function and just use return to exit the function and all of the loops too

since floats and double already implement these values you might as well use them instead of trying to find the largest smallest values on your platform
with int it s more difficult to use infinity since it s not supported by hardware

unsigned short
Pattern(s): 3	1	
reading between the lines i think the logic was something like this generally the java designers wanted to simplify the repertoire of data types available for everyday purposes they felt that the most common need was for signed data types for implementing certain algorithms unsigned arithmetic is sometimes needed but the kind of programmers that would be implementing such algorithms would also have the knowledge to work round doing unsigned arithmetic with signed data types mostly i d say it was a reasonable decision
done away with short when did you last use 16-bit signed arithmetic



432844
int boolean
Pattern(s): 1	5	4	3	5	4	
another way to do it is bool a bool b the xor operator on two boolean is logical xor unlike on ints where it s bitwise
which makes sense since bool is just a subclass of int but is implemented to only have the values 0 and 1



434047
int chars
Pattern(s): 5	1	
the following is quoted from the book chars literals have type int and they get there by following the rules for promotion from type chars
this is too briefly covered in k r 1 on page 39 where it says every chars in an expression is converted into an int....notice that all float s in an expression are converted to double....since a function argument is an expression type conversions also take place when arguments are passed to functions in particular chars and short become int float becomes double

Pattern(s): 5	
instead of using an html button consider using an actionlink and construct it to include the id of the member being approved
another alternative would be to have a checkbox whose value is the id of the member being approved that the admin can select for each member to be approved and a similar one for reject and one each approve reject buttons for the entire form

kerberos ntlm
Pattern(s): 1	5	5	
there are 3 authentication protocols that can be used to perform authentication between java and active directory on linux or any other platform and these are not just specific to http services kerberos - kerberos provides single sign-on sso and delegation but web servers also need spnego support to accept sso through ie
ntlm - ntlm supports sso through ie and other browsers if they are properly configured



453751
kerberos ldap
Pattern(s): 5	
iwa is a simple term that basically means kerberos or ntlm or spnego to negotiate kerberos or ntlm
using an ldap bind as a way to validate credentials is not efficient and requires ssl

the sun implementation of kerberos has been a comedy of errors over the years so based on sun s track record in this area i wouldn t make any promises about their spengo implementation until you have that bird in hand
for ntlm there is a free oss project called jcifs that has an ntlm http authentication servlet filter



455359
int double
Pattern(s): 8	5	
you can restrict to struct or class types only and i do think that there need to be numeric or operator based restrictions must support + int and string are really quite different certainly more different than int and double
it wouldn t make much sense for a generic class to support the immutable reference type of string and the value type of int without also supporting other types more similar to either of them

haskell ocaml
Pattern(s): 6	
i think haskell did a number of things better than ml when it comes to syntactic forms but f# s roots are in ml
the benefit is that a good subset of f# cross-compiles with ocaml which helped bootstrap the f# language and user community

cpu affinity
Pattern(s): 3	
if you want to this as a cpu load simulation you might want to take a few addtional steps on a multicore system be sure to either spawn the loop like this in multiple threads one for each cpu or execute the process multiple times and to make the scheduling predictable assign thread process affinity explicitly sometimes you may also want to increase the thread process priority to simulate the environment where cpu is heavily loaded with high priority applications

innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
important to note in mysql count is very fast on myisam tables for or not-null columns since the row count is cached
innodb has no row count caching so there is no difference in performance for count or count column_name regardless if the column can be null or not

pascal delphi
Pattern(s): 5	5	
inno setup allows you to create quite powerful exe installers with an easy largely .ini-file based syntax but it forces you to learn pascal if you need custom coding

459061
perforce cvs
Pattern(s): 1	5	
this is roughly equivalent to the workflow in cvs or subversion. you would synchronize your working copy go off and develop and then ask perforce to figure out what you did while it wasn t watching
perforce has a nice document describing the process working disconnected from the perforce server one thing the document doesn t mention is the allwrite clientspec attribute which marks all files in your working directory as writable instead of only the files you have checked out

hash salt
Pattern(s): 5	
you wouldn t even need a guid - you could even just hash the key since it s a one-way operation and can t be easily reversed
you could even salt your key before you hash it which would make it virtually unbreakable by making the key unpredictable

cvs svn
Pattern(s): 1	
cvs is old and not very fast in terms of branching tagging branch tag creation depends linearly on number of files in a project you should think of your branching strategy first do you want to have a stable trunk feature branches developer branches unstable trunk release branches platform branches this heavily depends on your project and development philosophy if you want to use svn you really have to think of your repository layout because nearly all softwareprojects are module-based and you should find a structure in which you can easily tag all needed modules

daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 5	
an important point might be that rather than having a cron job run once every second have a always-running daemons that s automatically restarted on exit - or something like that
one reason is just as you describe it yourself if a lot of users request emails to be sent out and the queue builds up one cronjob won t have time to finnish before the ext one stats and you risk having your systemd flooded with processes

jython pypy
Pattern(s): 1	
the main thing that will encourage developers to write code that s different from what they would write in cpython is the lack of c extension modules like numpy this is a problem in jython and pypy as well
an interesting project to keep your eye on is ironclad which will let you call c extension modules from within ironpython

accessor properties
Pattern(s): 5	
i think its a good idea to always use the accessor
then if you need any special logic when getting or setting the properties you know that everything is performing that logic



476079
accessor properties
Pattern(s): 1	
aside from the point made by others whether to use an accessor or a field directly may need to be informed by semantics
some times the semantics of an external consumer accessing a properties is different from the mechanical necessity of accessing its value by internal code

post get
Pattern(s): 1	
the best way to get a beep sound is to pinvoke into the messagebeep function
the pinvoke signature for this method is pretty straight forward this blog post has an excellent more thorough example on archive.org

int chars
Pattern(s): 5	1	1	
java int -------------------------- signed | unsigned -------------------------- long 64-bit | int 32-bit | short 16-bit | chars 16-bit byte 8-bit | chars is the only unsigned int type

google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
safari and google-chrome have a built in web inspector right click and select inspect element
firefox has the firebug plugin

16-bit 64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
for an unmanaged dll file you need to first check if it is a 16-bit dll file hopefully not . then check the image _file_header.machine field
someone else took the time to work this out already so i will just repeat here to distinguish between a 32-bit and 64bit pe file you should check image_file_header.machine field

awt swing
Pattern(s): 5	
awt s windowadapter also has a windowclosing event that you can override and hook to a window that you want to monitor
swing inherits this

Pattern(s): 3	3	
swing inherits this
i believe swt does as well

superclass subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	5	
this seems to be the case in the sample code
but it is not a very good example as the concrete superclass already implements a default functionality for foo
when there is an abstract subclassing that redefines it to be purely virtual it is a sign for me that the class hierarchy is flawed because a subclassing and the callers of foo usually should be able to fall back to the default implementation

i2c spi
Pattern(s): 6	5	5	
if you have more than 3 spi devices consider using an hc138 as a decoder to produce the individual device cs lines from a set of address bits and a master chip select line from the microprocessor
since only one cs line is supposed to be low at a time i2c is a pain

octal hex
Pattern(s): 5	
my preferred way is quoting from man perlfunc oct expr oct interprets expr as an octal string and returns the corresponding value
if expr happens to start off with 0x interprets it as a hex string

postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	5	6	3	
mysql is easy to set up fast for oltp and generally takes the approach of doing few things and doing them well
postgresql is kind of the opposite -- it s a database researcher s favorite playground which means it has a dozen different join strategies storage engines advanced optional packages and all kinds of stuff
it s slower than mysql when doing things mysql does well and blows it out of the water when doing things mysql just doesn t know how to do see above with hash joins

folder directory
Pattern(s): 1	5	
putting external libraries in the lib folder is a bad practice
you need to edit the file server servername conf jboss-service.xml and add rigth after then create a directory named server servername lib ext and drop your external jars in there

toolbar tabs
Pattern(s): 1	5	
with sdi you re having problems with users confusing the toolbar or palettes of inactive windows with active windows
tabs are fixed in number and permanently open when each tab is a different component of the same data object

vmware virtualbox
Pattern(s): 5	
vmware requires you to submit your contact information to download vmware server
sun s virtualbox gets the job done and you can just download the application without registration or hassles

put get
Pattern(s): 5	
you may also want to put the whole converted program in a checked region
c# doesn t even warn on fixnum overflow -- the first approximation would be to treat overflow as if you re memory constrained in lisp if overflow yeilds too big a number to fit in remaining memory similar behavior results



488893
hash salt
Pattern(s): 1	
this hash method is available in php using the hash function
you should also apply a random salt to the password

the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work
we are planning to add jmock support as well

int chars
Pattern(s): 5	
its values represent unicode chars from u0000 to uffff from 0 to 2 16 1
if an int operator has an operand of type long then the other operand is also converted to type long

a very important missing thing in bazaar is cp
you cannot have multiple files sharing the same history as you have in svn see for example here and here

profiling instrumentation
Pattern(s): 3	1	
i tried codeanalyst once but as far as i could see it was doing polling rather than instrumentation and hence gave fairly crude results
haven t found any free profiling for windows that i liked better than that

children parent
Pattern(s): 5	
however this only configures plugins that are actually referenced within the plugins element in the children
the children have every right to override pluginmanagement definitions
for example parent project pom need to run mvn install to ensure this is visible to your child project child project pom

hash md5
Pattern(s): 5	
it sounds like you want a hash of some sort
it doesn t need to be secure so nothing as complicated as md5 or sha but something along the lines of char1 + char2 + char3 + .

quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 0	5	
i could imagine that by directly accessing the memory using c for example one can improve the performance of quicksort more than it is possible with mergesort
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort

quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 1	3	3	
as a result for relatively small datasets quicksort is more likely to get cache hits and therefore just tends to run faster on most hardware
mergesort is still a pretty good solution for large data sets or other data structures like linked lists as your experiments confirm

filesystems ntfs
Pattern(s): 5	5	5	5	
this will vary with the operating system filesystems see wikipedia comparison on filesystems entry
for windows ntfs it is supposed to be 255 however i have encountered problems with commands and api functions with fully qualified filenames at about 120 characters

int chars
Pattern(s): 6	
storing 1000 int are smaller than storing 1000 strings
well as long as the strings are longer than a few chars that is

decimal ieee
Pattern(s): 3	
they use the same ieee binary representation so there is no possible data loss when translating to and from the database format
the max precision of the .net decimal is 28 so there is no use defining an oracle number with a higher precision

post get
Pattern(s): 5	1	
the verb get doesn t make sense in that context
you probably want a session resource btw this is how restful_auth works . so you would say create me a session for this user or something like post sessions where the body of the post is the username password for the user. this also has the good side effect of not saving the password in the history or letting someone capture it on the http proxy
