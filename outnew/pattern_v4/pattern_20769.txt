lxml elementtree
Pattern(s): 1	
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well
