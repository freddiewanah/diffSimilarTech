emacs aquamacs
Pattern(s): 0	
someone syncs carbon emacs with the upstream tree quarterly i think
aquamacs has a more irregular schedule but it s seen some pretty major updates over the last year

imperative
declarative is usually better for anything where you really don t need the fine-grained control over how something is done

postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	1	
mysql is much more commonly provided by web hosts
postgresql is a much more mature product

perforce svn
Pattern(s): 0	
i use perforce right now and for some reason i like svn better
perforce definitely gives me a better indication that there s going to be merge conflicts and even has built-in tools to help me resolve the merges

ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 1	
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it

quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 1	
wikipedia s explanation is typically quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other θ nlogn algorithms because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures and in most real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the probability of requiring quadratic time
quicksort mergesort i think there are also issues with the amount of storage needed for mergesort which is ω n that quicksort implementations don t have

daemons systemd
Pattern(s): 1	
gdi+ text rendering performance article on his blog which answers the raw speed question on his systemd gdi drawtext was about 6 times faster than gdi+ drawstring
if you need to be a real speed daemons textout is faster than drawtext but you ll have to take care of clipping and word-wrapping yourself

innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
i found that the table-level locking in myisam caused serious performance problems for our workload which sounds similar to yours
unfortunately i also found that performance under innodb was also worse than i d hoped

bazaar git
Pattern(s): 1	
git well is not for the uninitiated
it is much faster than both mercurial and bazaar and was written to manage the linux kernel



77945
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 0	
with o n 2 worst case that rarely happens quicksort is potentially far slower than the o nlogn of the merge sort
quicksort has less overhead so with small n and slow computers it is better
but computers are so fast today that the additional overhead of a mergesort is negligible and the risk of a very slow quicksort far outweighs the insignificant overhead of a mergesort in most cases

subtraction multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
addition and subtraction are then a very simple integer operation such as 0.72 + 1 becomes 72 + 100 becomes 172 becomes 1.72
multiplication is slightly more complex as it needs an integer multiply followed by a scale back such as 0.72 2 becomes 72 200 becomes 14400 becomes 144 scaleback becomes 1.44

addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 1

perforce svn
Pattern(s): 1	
but the svn clients are better especially the eclipse plugin
perforce is more expensive

opera firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around



179813
verilog vhdl
Pattern(s): 0	
for hdl choice verilog is to c as vhdl is to ada
so verilog is easier to get started with but you can make mistakes more easily



195398
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
of course the picture is not so simple innodb tables on mysql have a very different performance behaviour at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
postgresql does comply better with standards so it can be easier to replace later



256099
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 0	
but the server-side part is pretty simple
the client-side part is trickier i think



257043
des aes
Pattern(s): 0	
triple des is generally better but there are some known theoretical attacks
if you have a choice of cipher you might want to look at aes instead



260148
lxml elementtree
Pattern(s): 1	
it provides a nice easy-to-use binding for libxml2 and libxslt and it also implements the elementtree
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well



260148
lxml libxml2
Pattern(s): 1	
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well



268287
inherited subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
there is a cost to designing for inherited it can pin down your implementation you have to declare which methods are going to call which other methods in case a user overrides one but not the other it reveals your implementation rather than just the effects it means you have to think of more possibilities when designing things like equals are hard to design in an inherited tree it requires more documentation an immutable type which is subclassing may become mutable ick item 17 of effective java goes into more details on this - regardless of the fact that it s written in the context of java the advice applies to .net as well



268335
ssd sata
Pattern(s): 1	
to improve the speed the first thing i d try is a faster hard drive or an ssd
sata is pretty much the easiest fastest option

emacs jedit
Pattern(s): 1	
emacs with paredit mode just owns for structured editing of s expressions
add to that the highlight parens mode and it gets even better

division multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
since most processors can do an addition comparison or multiplication in a single cycle those are all counted as one flop
but division always takes longer

division addition
Pattern(s): 0	
since most processors can do an addition comparison or multiplication in a single cycle those are all counted as one flop
but division always takes longer



355552
haskell scheme
Pattern(s): 0	
but haskell is a bit trickier in that you can attempt to redefine a variable within the same scope but instead you just introduce another recursion equation
this is a pitfall for people who learned ml or scheme first this is perfectly good ml or scheme let but haskel has scheme letrec semantics without the restriction to lambda values



384966
dotnetzip sharpziplib
Pattern(s): 1	
i ve found the dotnetzip library to be this easiest way to work with zip files
sharpziplib is a far more powerful and flexible solution



396114
case-sensitive case-insensitive
Pattern(s): 1	1	
if you want to do case-sensitive compare on strings then you could use a switch statement as it is faster than performing a string.compare in an if else
for some actual performance tests however if you wanted to do a case-insensitive then it is better using a if else as the resulting code is not pretty



413338
mouse keyboard
Pattern(s): 1	
it is possible to re-arrange the file tabs by using the mouse to drag-sort them click and hold the mouse button on a tab and then drag it to the new location
this should make it possible to arrange them so that keyboard switching is more natural



422511
kerberos ntlm
Pattern(s): 0	
from my experience kerberos is more of a prefered method but i have not worked with it much so unfortunately i don t have much advise as far as that goes
on a side note i recall reading somewhere that the jre also has ways of tying into ntlm on your web server in order to obtain identity information for the authenticated user



426058
bazaar git
Pattern(s): 1	
take a look at bazaar
it s rather less daunting than git and has a useful-looking interface to subversion repositories via bzr-svn



488978
mockito jmock
Pattern(s): 0	
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work
we are planning to add jmock support as well



497332
haskell sml
Pattern(s): 1	
haskell is extreme lazy pure has active users lots of documentation and makes runnable applications
sml is less extreme strict impure has active users formal specification many implementations sml nj mlton moscow ml etc.



497933
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 1	
as a result for relatively small datasets quicksort is more likely to get cache hits and therefore just tends to run faster on most hardware
mergesort is still a pretty good solution for large data sets or other data structures like linked lists as your experiments confirm
