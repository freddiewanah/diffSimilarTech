gridview repeater
Pattern(s): 1	
the gridview is for tabular data only and does a lot of the work for you like binding data automatically to columns
the repeater gives you more control over the result but you have to do more because nothing gets binded automatically



2197183
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 0	
for windows and mac osx not for linux
you will need to install an svn client on ubuntu that supports the newer repo format



2237837
boost allocator
Pattern(s): 1	
using boost variant is faster than a union and leads imo to the most elegant code
i d guess that the extremely poor performance of the class hierarchy approach is due to the need to use dynamic memory allocator and dynamic dispatch



2267285
onclick onchange
Pattern(s): 0	
when settting the checked state programatically the onchange handler never fires in those browsers
i concur with pointy that onclick is a better way to handle checkboxes if you want to avoid surprises



2271760
nerdtree netrw
Pattern(s): 0	
the nerdtree plugin gives you a collapsible project tree
personally i find that the netrw plugin is more than sufficient and this usually comes installed with vim



2277052
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them



2293090
haskell ocaml
Pattern(s): 0	
imo it s is much more straightforward to achieve c++ - like performance in ocaml than in haskell
through as already said haskell has much nicer community packages tools and support syntax features ffi probability monads via typeclasses and parallel programming support



2336575
gif png
Pattern(s): 0	
you should use png instead of gif because png offers better compression and features



2393989
nunit mstest
Pattern(s): 1	
there are several of these implemented by 3rd parties for mstest
nunit is much faster



2422410
nunit mstest
Pattern(s): 0	1	0	
nunit is an older more established unit testing framework designed to do exactly one thing - unit testing
mstest is newer so it does not have the same level of maturity in its api



2436304
haskell scheme
Pattern(s): 1	
if you re interested in functional programming haskell is the only purely functional language on that list
common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure



2467567
mp3 ogg
Pattern(s): 0	
ogg vorbis is better quality per meg than mp3 plus no licensing legal issues



2496793
fgets getline
Pattern(s): 0	
edit as wolfer alluded to a null in your input will cause the string to be terminated prematurely when using fgets
getline is a better choice if available since it handles memory allocation and does not have issues with nul input



2535830
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 0	
if you just want the fun of linux command line programs without access to all of ubuntu cygwin is smaller and might be faster



2625704
swt swing
Pattern(s): 1	
we rely on swt for our java guis
yes you have to include an external native library but the look and feel is native more responsive although swing has become much faster in the past few years and seamless with other apps on the target platform



2665997
multiplying subtract
Pattern(s): 0	
zero or multiplying by one
this also reveals that subtract is a better search term than minus



2688976
trie tree
Pattern(s): 1	
finally b + tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity



2699569
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 0	
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations and in at least some implementations leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has



2750804
wxpython pyqt
Pattern(s): 1	1	
and now we had to switch into pyqt since qt is integrated in maya 2011
however wxpython is more straight forward and you can easily start working on wxpython and learn wxpython from zero fast . it provides and awesome resources and decumentation
wxpython qt provides more powerful features that you cant find in wxpython for example the multi touch detection qt also provides good support for drawing devices like pc tablets and so on



2844021
django web2py
Pattern(s): 0	
if you are starting an app from scratch a full-stack framework like django and web2py is the best options
django gives you a better looking database administrative interface



2848888
division multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
multiplication and division is a lot slower over an order of magnitude



2848888
division subtraction
Pattern(s): 0	
addition and subtraction is roughly 3 times as slow as for normal int s
multiplication and division is a lot slower over an order of magnitude



2867802
gridview repeater
Pattern(s): 0	
also you can use templatecolumn with gridview and add your labels into this template column
but imo repeater is simpler to customize your view by templates



2882325
erlang ocaml
Pattern(s): 1	
erlang is more practical but not quite as amenable to metaprogramming
ocaml is another possible choice but suffers a bit on the practicality front as well



2889354
gridbaglayout springlayout
Pattern(s): 1	
the springlayout has an example that does exaclty this
the gridbaglayout is more difficult to use but also support row column type layout



2892969
comparator comparable
Pattern(s): 1	1	
if the ordering of an object is an implementation detail of the object the comparable is more appropriate
if the ordering of the objects is controlled by the caller then comparator is more appropriate



2912577
apache nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having nginx on the front end nginx gives you a lot of flexibility



2914733
swt swing
Pattern(s): 1	
addendum gilbert le blanc raises an excellent point about the ease portability of swing
in contrast swt requires slightly more effort to deploy but some users prefer the greater fidelity of org.eclipse.swt.widgets.filedialog as shown here



2927816
exponent modulo
Pattern(s): 0	
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt exponent using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero



2963234
factors mean
Pattern(s): 0	
taking a guess at what you mean a subquery in the with clause is typically executed only once before the main query is executed
for large datasets subquery factors is obviously better since you re executing the subquery only once in most if not all cases



2985456
ubuntu debian
Pattern(s): 0	
in ubuntu it is a bit easier to install packages for java development but it doesn t really matter that much
remember that ubuntu is based on debian so ubuntu works the same



2985456
ubuntu debian
Pattern(s): 0	
remember that ubuntu is based on debian so ubuntu works the same
ubuntu just adds more user-friendly gui s



3025706
jboss glassfish
Pattern(s): 0	
other than that - jboss especially 5.x is an excellent application server
glassfish has better administration console and documentation support for java ee 6 in glassfish 3 and better documentation



3034603
mvp presenter
Pattern(s): 1	
for example in an mvp - based web application
now another class such as a presenter is less likely to depend on the standardnavigator implementation and more likely to depend on the inavigator interface since the implementation would need to be cast to an interface to make use of the redirect method



3072211
swt swing
Pattern(s): 1	
but in practice it all depends on swt and swing implementations on each platform
in my experience swt is faster in windows but it is not faster on mac os x



3082138
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
sql support - postgresql is much better for complex sql-queries for example with lots of joins and aggregates
mysql s stored procedures didn t feel very mature



3084827
bottle flask
Pattern(s): 1	
so i m biased because i m the author of flask but here something to help you make the pick
itty - very minimal framework bottle is probably a more stable alternative if you want a single file installation



3114467
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
using stored procedures helped out regarding structuring the project but performance actually got a little worse this was at the time stored procedures was a new feature in mysql
postgresql performs better with complex queries in my experience but writing real graph queries for it isn t really possible read here and here for why this is so



3168292
prng random
Pattern(s): 0	
the f#.net journal articles numerical libraries special functions interpolation and random numbers 16th march 2008 and numerical libraries linear algebra and spectral methods 16th april 2008 tested quite a bit of functionality and nmath was actually the slowest of all the commercial libraries
their prng was slower than all others and 50 slower than the free math.net library some basic functionality was missing the ability to calculate gamma -0.5 and other basic functionality the gamma-related functions they did provide was broken



3182877
gradle ivy
Pattern(s): 0	
we use gradle and chose it over maven and ant
ant gave us total flexibility and ivy gives better dependency management than maven but there isn t great support for multi-project builds



3184838
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
the problem with myisam is that myisam locks the table when myisam s in use whereas innodb just locks the row
innodb is a bit slower because of this but allows simultaneous access to the same table so innodb s more suitable for heavy traffic transactions



3217975
boost allocator
Pattern(s): 0	
better is to use shared_ptr or many of the other popular smart pointers available in boost and or tr1 and or c++0x
performance-wise objects allocated on the stack can be done so very quickly the stack size is increased per-function-call so all the required memory has been allocated up-front by a simple move of a pointer. contrarily dynamic allocator generally requires much more time



3218551
quicksort heapsort
Pattern(s): 0	
unless you re going to write a very good sort probably quicksort merge sort or heapsort depending on your specific needs quicksort will be better and quicksort takes fewer lines of code



3227242
profiling instrumentation
Pattern(s): 0	
this is due to the fact that profiling need to instrumentation the code to keep track of invocations - this can interfere with the jit s ability to inline those methods and the instrumentation overhead becomes significantly larger than the time spent actually executing the methods body



3324822
client-side server-side
Pattern(s): 0	
if you control the server-side code then simplify the wsdl so that server-side validates the same soap message
you ll notice that the client-side code becomes a lot simpler too and you will gain a better understanding of what your web service is offering



3359437
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
since you re looking at a pretty even mix of read write traffic innodb is the better choice
myisam s full-table locks on every write would probably be murder



3365484
boost stl
Pattern(s): 1	
boost makes it much neater
i never use the stl



3366523
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want a reliable as in other parts of the system will worry about errors and retries stream of bytes between the two pcs then tcp ip is not much more complicated to use than udp



3422364
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
mysql is most supported by shared hosting hence the m in lamp linux apache mysql php
but postgresql is getting more support too



3436045
ubuntu linux
Pattern(s): 1	
i started using ubuntu for rails development a few weeks ago and have noticed a big improvement over windows although i still dual boot due to the following
terminal in linux is alot more robust than command prompt



3497719
mathml mathjax
Pattern(s): 0	
it follows pretty much the same principles as jsmath but adds support for mathml and takes better advantage of modern browsers webfonts and javascript technology
while davide will answer questions about jsmath no future development will likely occur on it and its users are strongly encouraged to move to mathjax



3533390
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 0	
additionally innodb has row level locking which is far more performant under concurrent load than myisam table level locking
i could keep going but somone s already provided a really good summary of why innodb is a better choice for oltp



3563703
opera safari
Pattern(s): 0	
opera is lower at 30 cookies
safari 3 has no apparent cookie limit



3605068
google-chrome firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
your html was invalid and google-chrome did not accept it
firefox was more lenient in what it allowed



3605831
lxml celementtree
Pattern(s): 0	
as a side-effect of implementing proper parent traversal lxml is a bit slower than celementtree for parsing



3607684
arraylist treeset
Pattern(s): 0	
so if you re mainly retrieving and don t sort often arraylist is the better choice
if you sort often but dont retrieve that much treeset would be a better choice



3646066
django web2py
Pattern(s): 1	
in contrast to turbogears django is more out-of-the-box
i don t have any experience with web2py but from my impression it tries to do a little to much out-of-the-box



3646066
turbogears web2py
Pattern(s): 1	
in contrast to turbogears django is more out-of-the-box
i don t have any experience with web2py but from my impression it tries to do a little to much out-of-the-box



3659729
querypath phpquery
Pattern(s): 1	
generally querypath is better suited for manipulation of documents
while phpquery also implements some pseudo ajax methods just http requests to more closely resemble jquery



3670082
union distinct
Pattern(s): 1	
if you want to ensure two collections have the same distinct set of members where duplicates in either are ignored you can use
using the set operations intersect union except is more efficient than using methods like contains



3676955
addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
as you see integer multiplication floating-point multiplication and floating-point addition all took about the same time
array indexing took a little longer and you re doing it three times and integer addition was a little faster



3689215
sortedlist sorteddictionary
Pattern(s): 1	
from sorted data sortedlist is faster
than sorteddictionary



3745138
udp tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
udp is a lightweight protocol that by design doesn t handle things like packet sequencing
tcp is a better choice if you want robust packet delivery and sequencing



3791471
realloc malloc
Pattern(s): 1	
the main thing to know about realloc is that it is often capable of determining the actual size of the block of memory that any of the heap allocation routines returned and see if the block is big enough already or in some cases if it would be best try to shrink the block or move it
malloc is used more because it is simplest



3819023
lxml libxml2
Pattern(s): 0	
lxml is much easier to use than the xml libraries included in the standard python library
it s a binding for the c libxml2 library so i m assuming it s also faster



3828932
datamapper activerecord
Pattern(s): 1	
the datamapper is not more modern or newer but just more suited for an orm
the main reason people change is because activerecord does not make for a good orm



3838911
alarmmanager timertask
Pattern(s): 0	
timer and timertask are fine for things with short periods that are only relevant while an activity is on-screen
alarmmanager is for longer periods such as time and date to be notified because it allows your service to get out of memory



3860644
implements extends
Pattern(s): 1	
there is also sortedset extends set and blockingqueue extends queue
now concrete classes implements set is more understandable if set explicitly state which interface in the heirarchy it is implements even though it may look redundant at times



3867552
profiling instrumentation
Pattern(s): 1	
as you noted tier interaction profiling tip gives you more detailed information about calls to databases right down to the sql statements for more information refer to the profiling blog
another recommended option when profiling asp.net is to profile using instrumentation mode



3900409
direct3d gdi
Pattern(s): 1	
imho the right way to go is direct3d or opengl but given delphi is windows only maybe direct3d is better
direct3d was introduced exactly because the gdi is not good at such tasks



3927111
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 0	
a safer approach would be to create a private map between a label and myobject using a dictionary instance
this approach has the extra overhead of a dictionary but produces more reliable code imho



3968498
prng random
Pattern(s): 1	
most random sources don t produce real random bits all that fast and it s hard to tell whether you ve made a bad blunder
a good prng is better for virtually all intents and purposes



3983743
codeigniter yii
Pattern(s): 1	
you may find it getting in your way a bit more too as you try to do everything the yii way
codeigniter is more flexible - gives you the foundation you need w o getting in your way
