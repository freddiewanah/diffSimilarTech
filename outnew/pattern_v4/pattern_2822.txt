serializable deserialization
Pattern(s): 0	0	
serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state

strcpy strncpy
Pattern(s): 0	
use strcpy and check the buffer size by hand
strncpy is a little safer but dangerous in other way

hex binary
Pattern(s): 1	
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc



1716751
arp tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
arp would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time



1730167
lisp scheme
Pattern(s): 0	
clojure because it purportedly gives nice clean access to the huge universe of j2se j2ee libraries on the other hand encourages me to relearn this lisp dialect because it may finally be of practical use
as for which one to start with i would say scheme is simpler and so might be more appropriate to start with



1730263
innodb myisam
Pattern(s): 1	
with only a few transactions per second tps you re not likely to tell the difference in the performance but innodb is more reliable and scales better
2 with only 2-3 tps you will not see any significant difference between innodb and myisam



1734747
icomparable compareto
Pattern(s): 0	
the icomparable defines order less than greater than
the method defined by icomparable is compareto with which you can determine the order between two elements



1738309
matlab simulink
Pattern(s): 0	
generally matlab has a better programming environment better documentation better debuggers better object browser and is easier to use you can use matlab without doing any programming if you want
simulink allows you to visually program by connecting blocks in graphs



1747128
printwriter bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 1	
printwriter just exposes the print methods on any writer in character mode
bufferedwriter is more efficient than according to its buffered methods



1754080
sortedlist sorteddictionary
Pattern(s): 0	
as you can see on sorted data the sorted list is faster than the sorteddictionary
on unsorted data the sortedlist is slightly quicker on retrieval but about 9 times slower on adding



1760658
quicksort mergesort
Pattern(s): 0	
mergesort is a stable sort and typically the efficient quicksort implementations are not
while mergesort may do more swaps or moves mergesort does fewer comparisons and so tends to work better with text input



1760658
mergesort heapsort
Pattern(s): 0	
while mergesort may do more swaps or moves mergesort does fewer comparisons and so tends to work better with text input



1786935
vim emacs
Pattern(s): 0	
this will sound stupid but i use vim because the keyboard shortcuts are mostly one finger at a time if not you can shift with one hand and key with the other and i map esc to something easier
emacs requires more contortions and hurts my hands



1786996
vim emacs
Pattern(s): 1	
that said over the years i ve tended toward vim because i find that it s harder for me to get lost in it s user interface when i can t remember what i m doing
i have also noticed over time that emacs is a little more touchy when it comes to tty settings



1792370
postgresql greenplum
Pattern(s): 0	
i think you ll find that postgresql works a lot better for nearly any workload olap especially than mysql
greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases



1811677
inline inlining
Pattern(s): 0	
be aware though that this should only be on a release build since inline code is difficult to debug
also you said that you don t mind making your program larger as long as it gets faster but that often inlining makes it slower



1853219
quicksort heapsort
Pattern(s): 0	
one of the major factors is that quicksort has better locality of reference -- the next thing to be accessed is usually close in memory to the thing you just looked at
by contrast heapsort jumps around significantly more



1937370
postgresql mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
in the event of having to kill the server forcefully either by kill -9 or due to power outage postgresql generally has better resilience to table corruption
full support for acid compliance and other relational db features that support for again imho and experiance are weak or lacking in mysql



1947902
opera google-chrome
Pattern(s): 0	
i found that on google-chrome safari and opera many special keys don t get passed through to ajaxterm including backspace the arrow keys ctrl + c ctrl + h home end etc
opera is even worse when you press shift the keypress gets translated into p so you can t type capitals

1991217
subtraction multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
addition and subtraction are simple
multiplication requires a bit more work as the naive algorithm requires nested loops

addition multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
addition and subtraction are simple
multiplication requires a bit more work as the naive algorithm requires nested loops
