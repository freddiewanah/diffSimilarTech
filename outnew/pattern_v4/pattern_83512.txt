width height
Pattern(s): 0	
your problem appears because the reference width is bigger then working width of your collectionview to fix this you must calculate your cells reference size properly
you re using uicollectionviewflowlayout so you can take an advantage of uicollectionviewdelegateflowlayout and implement the following method it is provided for the case when cells has fullscreen width and dynamic height keep in mind that if you re using multiple columns you should calculate cells width accordingly and mininteritemspacing should be taken into account

swift objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
on a personal note i have to say calling core audio api from swift is oftentimes more pain than gain
because of that it might be faster although a bit unsafer wrapping those portions of code into objective-c or plain c and exposing them via the swift bridging header if your project allows the swift bridging header

int chars
Pattern(s): 0	0	
well we need to check what happens with vectors with multi-digits which you seem to have and their corresponding vectors of multi-character strings the int vector still occupies 4 bytes for each element the numeric vector still occupies 8 bytes for each element
however the size per element in the chars vector is larger for larger strings
thus the transpose coerced your data frame to a chars matrix and the size of each chars element is larger than its corresponding numeric element

uitableview uicollectionviewlayout
Pattern(s): 0	
with each cell being different size flowlayout will request sizes for each cell separately to calculate total size of collectionview - that is required to properly handle scrolling scrollbars
uitableview it s a bit simpler as it s layout is much simpler only height matters - that s why it s possible to use estimatedsize there
the whole core layout process is well explained here to overcome this problem i would recommend using your custom uicollectionviewlayout and move your caching logic and reusing sizes for cells inside collectionviewlayout not in your viewcontroller

folder directory
Pattern(s): 0

the storage folder is for more general file storage use but i would have a look at the possibility of storing these files with a third party service



53470524
int double
Pattern(s): 0	
because according to the rules of overload resolution void function int y int w is a better match than void function float y float w and therefore there is no ambiguity
calls function 1.2 2 and function 1 2.2 both have one argument that is an int and is the exact match with one of the arguments of void function int y int w and so only one type conversion is required double to int

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
a for-loop is generally better for doing something a fixed number of times

dictionary map
Pattern(s): 0	
he reason for that is because map is a built-in function and works perfectly better with functions of a built-in function kind chain rule
based on your update you can just use str.replace instead of your function and a generator expression withing dict.fromkeys note that alternatively you could also use for constructing an empty dictionary which is also slightly faster than directly calling the dictionary type



53570256
for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
prints 3 to console so you could use numbeo.length the -1 is because the for-loop uses less or equal condition in your case
the for-loop goes from 0 to 100 because your numbeo arrays s size is 100

typedef struct
Pattern(s): 1	
o assign to items you must assign the address of each struct to each element in items remember you have storage for pointers not storage for struct item -- and you must ensure fruits remains in scope for the duration of your use of basket putting those pieces together you could do something similar to the following note i have simply used typedef and removed the struct labels themselves -- typedef s up to you
further you should validate the return from find_first_in_range is not null before printing example use output also note i ve bracket the high low range for memory use error check in any code you write that dynamically allocates memory you have 2 responsibilities regarding any block of memory allocated 1 always preserve a pointer to the starting address for the block of memory so 2 typedef can be freed when typedef is no longer needed



53997252
dictionary map
Pattern(s): 1	
you can use a list comprehension within a dictionary comprehension
since you need both keys and values use dict.items to iterate key-value pairs map works more efficiently with built-ins so you may wish to use or since you have coordinates for tuple values the problem with your logic is python lists do not support vectorised indexing so you need to be explicit the verbose

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 0	
nd since we re using i as the index for the arrays element to examine the value of would never change and therefore loops would go on forever
and for what it s worth when you re iterating over an arrays a for-loop is a better fit because a for-loop allows you to define the iteration variable the condition and the increment all in one place

here are two solutions at least the first is o n 2 and require to have two for loops to compare all the elements between two solutions at least the first is o n 2 self the second solution that you should use and that the problem force you to choose because the problem says that you can loops the arrays only once it is to find in one for-loop the minimum and the maximum of the arrays and control the arrays difference
if the arrays difference is more than the given number return true otherwise false

for-loop arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
keep in mind the data is within an arrays so there will be multiple .interval.title
using a for-loop is probably a better option here unless you re after a certain index

dictionary map
Pattern(s): 0	
rather than making a copy of the entire dictionary there is an easier scheme in which you ll just need to make a copy of all the keys in another linked-list
and in the original dictionary in each of the entries just also keep a reference to the linked-list entry corresponding to that key now if you want to iterate the 3 entries at a distance of 5 entries from 4297256046 you just need to do now the reason i mentioned linked-list was so that in case you want to delete any entries from the map you ll be also able to delete the corresponding entry from the linked list in o 1 time

std ostream
Pattern(s): 0	
just use std string and std ostream
ostream works with more of the stl and with strings you don t have to care about its memory usage and potential memory-leaks

jline readline
Pattern(s): 0	
simply instead of bufferedreader you use linereader string readline string prompt character mask string buffer prompt can be null is the unexpanded prompt pattern that will be displayed to the user on the left of the input line mask can also be null is the character used to hide user input when reading a password for example buffer is the initial content of the input line edit in jline s docs i found an even better solution printabove void printabove attributedstring str prints a string before the prompt and redraw everything

for-loop loops
Pattern(s): 1	
that is just the wonderful thing about list comprehension if it can work normally like the for-loop people wont create it because the for-loop is more readable and understandable
you may find out that the result of list comprehension is always a list meanwhile the result of for-loop would always many single values and these single values is a part of iterable x +1 for x in range 1 5 2 3 4 5 for x in range 1 10 print x+1 2 3 4 5 you can simply understand that loops comprehension already have the list of values then loops comprehension already have the list of values just simply feed orderly to the condition value by value

int chars
Pattern(s): 0	
printf is showing you a -1 since the format of d is a signed int which is smaller than unsigned usually by 1 bit
function local chars arrays go on the stack so that s the value you re looking for

dictionary map
Pattern(s): 1	
if array is long i suggest turning array is long i suggest into a since dictionary is faster has o 1 time complexity vs
o n for array.indexof then or if item.name can be abscent in map

drawingvisual rendertargetbitmap
Pattern(s): 0	
i tried to apply dpi scaling to the drawingvisual but the drawingvisual produced less image quality
also i tried to set the canvas to 756x378 the 96 dpi size then set the rendertargetbitmap to 2362x1181 and 300 dpi but that produced less image quality too

factors matrix
Pattern(s): 0	
benchmarking parallel work correctly is a tough task it is affected by the great many factors and features of a cpu cache
try to replace your workload with one that is very suited for multiprocessing working in a parallel on different parts of an array matrix multiplication.. one more important thing spawning the new processes also takes time and for one more important thing spawning the new processes to pay off the work done in each process needs to be significant if you increase your loop s range a little bit the difference should be in favor of the multi-process version on my machine this outputs 0.44509196281433105 1.3775699138641357

median max
Pattern(s): 0	
you can solve it using divide and conquer approach find a random element in between the minimum and maximum check if it s median if the median is lower or higher than the median and reduce the problem to a smaller size only on a subrange of the array

dictionary map
Pattern(s): 1	
different mappings have different ways to hash the input values unless you want to use a sorted dictionary which is more memory efficient but slower

submit submission
Pattern(s): 1	
i would certainly use trigger like this from jquery docs on submit forms can be submitted either by clicking an explicit or or by pressing enter when certain form elements have focus
it seems to me that manually triggering form submission is a better workable approach

distance mercator
Pattern(s): 0	
i do not need a great accuracy a variation of 5 from the real distance is definitely acceptable for me in this case you can definitely use web mercator
possible implementation in python note that web mercator implementation is much simpler than for example utm so the performance will be much better

post put
Pattern(s): 0	1	
when your case should use put if you know the id then your best bet is to do why post is meant more strictly for new resource creation
put is used more in situations where you want to create or replace which fits your requirement as closely as you re gonna get in my opinion
