swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
while direct equivalent is not available with swift this can be achieved relatively elegantly with objective-c and categories


47622708
range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
so if your new type is unsigned following rule #2 if we subtract one more than the max value of the new type 256 from 800 we eventually end up in the range of the new type with 32

47645500
scheme	racket
Pattern(s): 5	
chicken scheme and guile scheme are both scheme implementations and they differ from each other enough to be scheme dialects but then i don t think racket #lang racket should be called a scheme dialect or even a scheme implementation


47648519
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
when performing addition the usual arithmetic conversions are performed on the operands which state expr 11.5.3 otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


47648715
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
implicit arrays for script or functions in addition to anubhava s correct answer if basic syntax for-loop is there is a special case in bash when running a script or a function arguments passed at command lines will be assigned to arrays variable you can access by and so on

cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 0	
increment -3 to -2. 2 5 0 1 -2 - jump 4 steps forward escaping the maze. the code edit i compiled and ran the code with cpython that dropped runtime to 2.53s but that s still almost an order of magnitude slower than pypy


47668111

int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
for example if your functions operate on double s you can still say add 1 2 and the int arguments will be converted to double s


47682231
put	get
Pattern(s): 7	
while aaronfay s answer is good and works i think that given that there are only 3 http methods other than get and you are only worried about put it is clearer and simpler to just define the request sub-classes per method


47684810
oci	sqlplus

47686839
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 8	
i m surprised it s not more dramatic as x86 cpu div instructions can have latencies as high as 80-90 cycles for 64bit division on some cpus compared to mul at 3 cycles and bitwise ops at 1 cycle each


47689659
packets	pcap
Pattern(s): 0	
to quote the tip-of-the-master-branch pcap 3pcap man page packets buffer timeout if when capturing packets are delivered as soon as they arrive the application capturing the packets will be woken up for each packets as it arrives and might have to make one or more calls to the operating system to fetch each packet. if instead packets are not delivered as soon as they arrive but are delivered after a short delay called a packets buffer timeout more than one packets can be accumulated before the packets are delivered so that a single wakeup would be done for multiple packets and each set of calls made to the operating system would supply multiple packets rather than a single packets


47690182
inject	interceptor

versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
if any one might get into the similar problem then this is how i was able to fix this well some of my dependent library wanted the latest build versioning support might be updated or upgrade their code so gradle fetches the lates build if anyone have written versioning with 2+ or something like that avoid using that if not necessary and give fix library versioning

even tho it s longer this is more efficeint than min max solutions which still process the keys twice


47728251
ionic	angular
Pattern(s): 10	
it s just how the angular community works right now - anything that the angular team decides to endorse is becoming the safe standard whether it s good or not. that s why i think currently ionic is a less safe choice not because their ui or cli are not good but because the majority of the community will prefer to use angular material and angularcli no matter the actual differences. i believe that s why ionic is pushing to become relevant outside of the angular community it has become a hard environment to innovate outside of the core team but i believe the angular team is working to change that


47731412
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 10

- housekeeper only needs the single prototypecontroller sweep at the end and has more mentioned above - housekeeper thread checks for testing of connections before seeing what connections may be expired some risk of testing expired connection that may be broken terminate through other timeout to db in firewall etc. - the project has unfinished code properties that are defined but not acted upon - the default max connection life if not defined is 4 hours excessive - housekeeper thread runs every five seconds per pool excessive you can modify the code and make these improvements


47806832
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
just a few simplified examples of data structures used by memory managers note that this is not the data structure in the program you created a linked list of allocated blocks would come with a linear o n for a single malloc -free pair making your code o n 2 a buddy scheme would come with a logarithmic o log n making your code o n log n implementations stressing the time complexity of malloc and free as an aspect of being fast would probable come close to o 1 i am imagining hash-tables this would probably come with a penalty in memory consumption and with a high 1 the constant time might be longer than for the other concepts with low n this would make your code o n or o 1 for low n note there is a scheme to make the memory manager data structures applying to all examples above within the administrated memory that would allow finding the block to free and relative to it the administration data in o 1 resulting in a free of o 1 . the mentioned data structures will however be searched by malloc taking the mentioned different time complexities for an unused block one which the size parameter to malloc does not helpfully point to directly . assuming that your code also has to malloc the blocks you are freeing you will probably actually end up with the mentioned complexities for the whole program

post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
in addition to the answer by don t panic dont forget to set the method attribute in your form tag to match your php code most likely it is pos or get or and you you can omit the method get since it is the default method. it worth mentioning that post is more secure and can carry more data since it uses the actual request body unlike get that appends the parameters to the url

stringr	stringi
Pattern(s): 10	
since stringi runs slightly faster and has a larger set of functionalities i prefer to stick with stringi . see stringi vs stringr blog by hrbrmstr i tried to use base r data.frame syntax above where possible to avoid any confusion but if i were doing this for my self i d stick to the full data.table syntax as follows


48015634
interpreted-language	compiled-language
Pattern(s): 10	
there are many discussions about compiled-language such as golang vs interpreted-language such as ruby but generally a compiled-language is faster because the compilation phase optimizes the code and because the target machine can natively run the program without the need to use an interpreter extra layer


48016590
ifttt	zapier
Pattern(s): 7	
ifttt is simpler to setup zapier has more options like sending to more than one emails

facts online firefox - view ok - save damaged ie - view ok - save damaged google-chrome - view error - save not working does anybody have the same problems


48025509
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
my example will skip the current line if it contains more than 20 chars before the first comma but cannot prevent int overflows if you specify too long number for id


48025850
servicebus	masstransit
Pattern(s): 0	
we use masstransit 2.9.9 and have more than 100 servicebus instances in a single process


48026426
octal	binary	octal	decimal
Pattern(s): 5	
i am using php 7.0.2 at one place in the manual on integers i saw the below statement integers can be specified in decimal base 10 hexadecimal base 16 octal base 8 or binary base 2 notation optionally preceded by a sign - or +


48026877
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
so far i have the query to aws working and ajax request returning the audiostream resource to the browser but firefox is complaining about the format media resource could not be decoded error error code ns_error_dom_media_metadata_err 0x806e0006 i m not very familiar with google-chrome debugging but it does not work there either


48027777
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
if the page requires to be scrolled to get to the save button and 692 23 would put the button behind a fixed header you should be able to verify that by taking a screenshot before the button click attempt then it may not be possible for whatever driver you re using to click the button


48028075
xslt	xquery
Pattern(s): 10	
as for creating a sequence of attributes you can t do that in xpath which can t create new nodes you can however do that in xslt then you can use it elsewhere as in and will get xquery has a more compact syntax and in contrast to xpath allows expressions to create new nodes


48029876
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
site www.b.com has a ssl certificate so it needs to be served using https


48033538
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem is that during the update your service will be briefly put in an inconsistent state and as a result clients will get random errors


48033566
mp3	ogg
Pattern(s): 5	
i m using a audio source here but you can plug in a video source instead as long as it contains an audio track format that can be decoded aac mp3 ogg etc.


48034918
mathml	tex
Pattern(s): 7	
tex is older shorter and functional superior to mathml and well similarly unreadable for humans


48035043

Pattern(s): 5	
if the target machine has hardware support for it if you are sure that int can be cast into double and back without any loss of precision


48036480
elasticsearch	kibana
Pattern(s): 5	
we re planning to use elk stack elasticsearch logstash kibana as a visualization tool but the question for us is how metrics should be delivered to kibana


48037510
listview	gridview
Pattern(s): 1	
i have a rather simple listview with gridview style


48037999
jlist	jtable
Pattern(s): 1	
you could use the key bindings api to add support but it s not intuitive and now you implementing functionality you d get for free using a jtable based solution anyway generally speaking it s not intuitive as jlist is not meant to be editable so most users won t have that expectation mindset and it could cause frustration for the user as their expected results don t meet what your program is now doing


48044897
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	
this is a performance killer for any server because disk even ssd is orders of magnitude slower than ram


48046260
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 0	0	
debian 9.3 is current but that probably matters much less than debian being tested less than ubuntu


48047100
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 10	
some deductions on the matter i understand that ubuntu is based on unstable debian so stable debian is better for production


48047255
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
in cases where the cell contents are larger than the width of the cell i would like to set the fittext property so that the row height is unchanged


48051060
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i m confused because many people says that swift is faster than objective-c in general


48053204
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 5	
i know i probably won t use more than 2 10 9 ids and if i did i could always use bigserial and it s not all that important but it seems a bit unclean to me to have signed integer reference an unsigned one


48053510
width	margin
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to control your image without adding style to the header you can simply add fixed width to a and make it display block since you know the width of your image then simply use margin auto or use display table and you don t need to specify a width


48054088
zeromq	ice
Pattern(s): 0	
for example i was expecting that zeromq would be faster than zeroc ice


48054088
zeromq	ice
Pattern(s): 10	
ice is faster even if zeromq is sending empty messages


48054088
zeromq	ice
Pattern(s): 7	0	
nevertheless zeromq is always slower than ice


48055816
margin	height
Pattern(s): 0	
one thing that is understood is the bottom spacing margin and padding will be equal to or slightly greater than ideally height + 8dp you bottom navigation


48060268
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
instead you should declare them in the tightest scope where they are needed i should be declared in loops header while count should be declared and initialized inside the for-loop


48061917
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 5	
as i wrote the question i ended up finding out how to do it it should also be noted that extends basic prototypes is usually not a good idea - in the event the base standard is changed to implements new functionality there might be a conflict in your own code base


48064089
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
if this interpretation is correct the your statement since the defers will be called when the for-loop ends is wrong printf will be called after loops but defer is called inside and everything is consistent with the behaviour explained in the other answers


48065307
qlocalsocket	qsharedmemory
Pattern(s): 7	
what we ended up doing for single instance is to use qlocalsocket which is named pipe on windows and local domain socket on unix instead of qsharedmemory which requires more tweaking to get it right


48065652
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	
i would even say that intuitively files can usually be much larger than ram but smaller than a single disk however even this is not always true


48065753
sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 0	
grouping is essentially mapping and should run faster than sorting


48065753
sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 0	
but my confusion is since i don t care about the order of name i should be able to do some kind of grouping which should be cheaper than sorting first and do sorting only on the numeric field


48067926
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
it will recurse down and check if the next value in the array is greater than or less than the min and max and set accordingly


48068716
std	ostream
Pattern(s): 5	5	
that expression does have type std ostream


48070030
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 5	
it s incredibly frustrating to have to always be suggested a directory first instead of a file since in my opinion jumping to a directory is totally useless - all it does is scroll you in the folder projects view to that directory


48073329
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
i made some changes to swift class so that it would be used in objective-c by using objective-c syntax


48074693
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 5	
for a number the default value is 0 if a function return number instead of sting the port will be 0 port 0 is a reserved port in tcp ip networking meaning that it should not be used in tcp or udp messages


48076727
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 0	
possible solutions create a separate listinguser that s than inherited by a detailuser that s declaring advantage allows clean typing backdrop adding more representations would be pain or not possible if not fitting in the inherited chain create a single user class that contains optional properties advantage single class to maintain backdrop you can never be sure which representation you currently have needs potentially a lot of checks


48077340
tsc	transpiler
Pattern(s): 5	
here i used vs code as an ide issue was will result in solution i should include the following tsconfig.json file in the project then i used tsc without file name so the transpiler would use the tsconfig.json to transcompile all type script files hosted in the directories to js files


48078157
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 5	
e.g. for readline that link is in the libreadline-dev package which can be installed on mint ubuntu debian type systems like this sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev perl 6 nativecall docs discuss this too if you write native foo nativecall will search libfoo.so under unix like system libfoo.dynlib on os x foo.dll on win32


48079189
libstdc++	libc++
Pattern(s): 1	
here libc++ is not fully binary compatible with libstdc++


48080991
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
a lot of people have answered that you can use generics but you can also simply remove the readinteger method and only use the readdouble as int can be converted to double without data loss


48084590
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
outputs i believe this would work as long as your slice_x and slice_y are smaller than the width and the height respectively


48087390
range	min
Pattern(s): 0	
if it was rounded down it is slightly less than min and hence it is also in the subnormal range


48087423
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
here is my code the block of my code can read a singe chars int only which is not exactly what i intend to do i intends to reads more than one chars int it doesn t work


48087725
percentile	max
Pattern(s): 0	
look into the max of the column to point out the outlier if its greater than 75 percentile of values


48089583
factors	matrix	lapply	grepl
Pattern(s): 10	
we can do this with mutate_all as grepl works on vector matrix and not on data.frame or using str_replace with base r we can use lapply it is better to create character columns instead of factors


48090955
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
even with a tighter bound you still need to handle more than int and double


48091291
width	margin
Pattern(s): 0	
you can do it by adding one more div with 980px width to wrap inner container so applied margin will work


48092359
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 10	
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case


48092359
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	0	
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also


48092359
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior


48095788
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 1	
that s all clear however i am not sure what with salt in hashing. i read os.urandom python is good to create good salt what i am not sure is how to work with this added salt if i hash user password with salt and its one way


48097207
qtextedit	qtextdocument
Pattern(s): 5	
i read in thread rich text to image in qt by dmitry sazonov it can maybe be done using qtextedit document qtextdocument drawcontents however i do not find any examples out there


48097791
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
i ve got somewhat of a solution where you just check if the elements position is less than 0 and if it is set it back to 0 or if it s greater than the width height set it to the width height


48097932
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
if you use a chars type in an arithmetic expression even unsigned chars it will be promoted to int 1 and arithmetic with int values is not fully specified in c notably the behavior upon overflow is undefined


48102278
packets	multicast
Pattern(s): 7	
i am suspecting that the current nic s mtu speed has to do with something since when i type like this below i get this ifconfig| grep mtu up broadcast running multicast mtu 1500 metric 1 up broadcast multicast mtu 1500 metric 1 up broadcast multicast mtu 1500 metric 1 up loopback running mtu 65536 metric 1 here is the result graph of latency as you can see the f-stack performance decreases when the packets size is more than 1500


48103516
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 1	
i would go for these two changes to optimize this query first i would split the query to two parts combined with a union preferably a union all if you don t care about removing duplicates but also possible with union distinct


48108576
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
sliderinput is not the option unless it could be shown as chars values not int


48108803
namenode	hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
this uploaded files could also be seen through hdfs namenode web ui


48109837
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
how can multiplication function takes longer than division


48110067
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
the amount of memory reserved depends on the data type a chars will take up more memory than an int


48111207
hide	show
Pattern(s): 5	
when opening said window the viewmodel of the datagrid would be loaded immediately - but since no row has been selected the viewmodel that belongs to the detailed view would not be intialized which means that the visibility binding of the detail view would fail and the binding s fallbackvalue would be used to hide the detail view. the issue with this approach is that the visual studio wpf xaml designer will not show the content of the affected containers since they are hidden due to their fallbackvalue


48112711
uicollectionview	uitableview
Pattern(s): 10	
i made the mistake at first to go with uitableview only to realize halfway that uicollectionview is way more powerful


48114598
mouse	keyboard	switching	screens
Pattern(s): 5	
i currently want to build a simple application using java or python. i started coding not long ago i do not know where to start from. these are things i would like to know basically i want to build a background application or program that detects current keyboard layout as in which language and just displays the next language on the screens everytime i push shift + alt so that i can know to which language i am switching in windows 10. because task bar is now set to automatically be hidden when mouse cursor is not around it


48115180
documentlistener	jcombobox
Pattern(s): 5	
my code applying documentlistener to txt_ip4class classw.main contains two conditions if zero it will set other fields based on jcombobox txt_ip4class will be replaced if one it should be set jcombobox choosing an option


48115769
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
to use it in layout file however you have to take care of cases such as the device is in landscape this way you ll have the width much greater than the height so the view won t fit


48117206
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 7	
public class fragment1 extends fragment implements loadermanager.loadercallbacks choreographer skipped 31 frames


48117790
pandas	dask
Pattern(s): 0	
this tells us that dask is about 50 slower than pandas for this task this is to be expected because the chunking and recombining of data partitions leads to some extra overhead


48118458
subtract	add
Pattern(s): 5	
i d like to add operator overloads to allow vector s to be added and subtract from each other


48118479
vsts	tfs
Pattern(s): 5	
this is possible if you make the switch to git which can be hosted inside tfs and vsts


48118711
super	self
Pattern(s): 5	
also if super is used then how should it be used like super btcwallet self .__init__ coin_name tx_fee or super wallet self .__init__ coin_name tx_fee problem 2 since coin_name and tx_fees isn t saved in the database so when could it fail


48119362
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
also note that this should be run server-side only as doing so client-side exposes information about your password requirements in plain-sight to any hackers yes it s still possible for them to figure it out by creating an account and trying to use easy passwords but it still means they have to put a little bit of effort into figuring out what is and is not allowed explanation assert position at the start of the line positive lookahead ensuring at least one lowercase letter in any language script exists positive lookahead ensuring at least one uppercase letter in any language script exists positive lookahead ensuring at least one number any any language script exists positive lookahead ensuring at least one character that isn t a letter number or control character in any language script exists match any character 8 or more times assert position at the end of the line


48119405
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
i m trying to make a what should be a simple responsive page that consists of several divs as depicted below the overall max-width and max-height are 1200 and 1000 respectively vertically-static divs must only resize horizontally if the browser window is resized but vertically they need to always be fixed in height vertically-resizeable div needs to adjust both its width and height based on the window dimensions


48121249
pull	push
Pattern(s): 5	
sadly so far i have been unable to come up with a solution that fulfills all our requirements only administrators and automated process accounts like maven release on jenkins can push directly to master everybody else must open a pull request which requires an approval everybody can merge approved pull requests we are a small organization on a github team plan and we re happy to switch plans if necessary


48121349
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 5	
result for sequence abb edit to filter out tuples with duplicates i like the idea of a callable dictionary that can be used with map


48122278
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
some stylistic points you don t need to use sizeof chars - it s defined to be 1 dsize should be unsigned and should really be a size_t which is bigger than an int as soronellhaetir points out you don t need to use another struct - you can modify the passed-in one


48125266
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 10	
this has many consequences namely that addition and multiplication is no longer associative


48126909
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
in swift each generic class represents its own type and even if you have a generic class where the generic type parameter is a subclassing of your other generic class having the superclass as its generic parameter the two generic classes won t be related through inherited


48127765
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
the framework is written in swift and can be used in objective-c as well so it combines rlmobject and object types


48128604
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
difference between tcp and socks5 proxy socks5 is a general proxy protocol that can do more than a tcp proxy including one-to-many connections listening ports and udp


48130775
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
the only routes that is available if one is not logged in is get post login and get post register after their declaration goes middleware that checks if user have special cookie if not a user will be redirected to get login and it works just fine. you can view the whole code if needed on github mnevo there is three main middlewares cookieparse parse cookie from request session encode cookie and write it to req.cookie.user validate if cipher was mine then you ll get json out of cookie if not it will be undefined i inserted console.log in each except cookie parser and in login route


48130969
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
please see the image below i have detected that the issue happens when the image width is more than 2x 2 times the height of the image


48133903
build.gradle	gradlew
Pattern(s): 5	
i want to add the tomcat plugin to my gradlew build but the plugin cannot be found gradlew shows the error plugin with id com.bmuschko.tomcat not found. i followed the steps on the github page of this plugin but it does not work. in my project i have general build.gradle in this i am loading my project.gradle in this i defined the tomcat-plugin configuration


48135237
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 1	
you can use elemmatch as a projection operator but this will only bring you first matching subdocument second way is by using aggregation framework here the point is that you need to grouping back your unwinded subscriptions to get back original shape after filtering


48136696
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
its height should be no more than the height of other cells and its width should be that of empty unoccupied area


48136700
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 10	
you should upgrade your system first because the 4.9.0 kernel versioning is no longer on kali linux repository then install the appropriate kernel headers package


48138459
equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 0	
based on these objects the compareto object must return a value either less than zero equals zero or greater than zero


48138913
rss	feed
Pattern(s): 10	10	
so if your rss feed is at the atom link element should be this including an atom link element in your rss feed makes it more portable and easier to cache


48140150
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
this is simplest to solve in postgresql in either database you can do this using not exists as well i used mysql syntax for the date arithmetic in this version


48140188
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
i checked and it looks fine unless width or height is greater than max texture size which i doubt or internal format rgba is not supported which also not likely here is the full code gl_call checks for glgeterror and it is set to gl_invalid_value 0x0501 after glteximage2d


48142362
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
my input and input1 should be set in int instead of chars


48142396
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
this definitions acts on the lifetime of variables automatic objects have their life bound by their containing block static objects come to life at the beginning of the program and their life extends to the end of the program dynamic variables are created by malloc and associated function s from the standard library and shall be destroyed by free


48143786
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 5	
since the data frame in the list are in the same format just coerce them into a single data frame with dplyr bind_rows saving the element name by passing an .id parameter which can be used for grouping after filtering by joining with wanted

ubuntu	linux
Pattern(s): 5	
what i wanted to do i installed fresh linux ubuntu 16.04 to setup a test developing environment


48148816
hide	show
Pattern(s): 0	
lowering the zindex of publisher to less than session hide the thumbnail and increasing it show the thumbnail


48149786
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
the upgrade-insecure-requests directive will not ensure that users visiting your site via links on third-party sites will be upgraded to https for the top-level navigation and thus does not replace the strict-transport-security hsts header which should still be set with an appropriate max-age to ensure that users are not subject to ssl stripping attacks


48153000
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
the second can be passed back to the function-caller on the end of the function and can even be resized with realloc realloc does not clear the new memory like calloc does malloc is like calloc without zeroing out the new memory


48156304

i am mapping this data against customized unique _id mapping settings index number_of_shards 5 mappings type properties abc type keyword timestamp type date format yyyy-mm-dd hh mm def type integer ghi type integer jkl type keyword mno type keyword pqr type keyword now i am sending parsed data every hour to elasticsearch so it updates if there is an updated field and can be visualized on kibana


48158446
rtp	rtcp
Pattern(s): 5	
pts can be calculated by rtp and rtcp. ref#1 h264 rtp timestamp non interleaved in which you must set the rtp timestamp to the pts + offset ref#2 synchronization between two rtp streams using rtcp sr


48161701

Pattern(s): 5	
in order to manually set the number of mappers in a hive query when tez is the execution engine the configuration tez.grouping.split-count can be used by either setting it when logged into the hive cli will create 4 mappers an entry in the hive-site.xml can be added via ambari


48162574
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 5	
something like this this worked fine in older versions of apt-key but recent versions have two issues a different output format i can hack around that a warning warning apt-key output should not be parsed stdout is not a terminal clearly i can hack around this as well just redirect stderr to dev null


48162764
min	max
Pattern(s): 2	
since according to the comment all the price records have the same amount you could use the aggregate max or min to just get one of them and a case expression to choose between max and sum depending on the price_volume_cost_indicator select price_volume_cost_indicator case price_volume_cost_indicator when price then max amount else sum amount end from my_table group by price_volume_cost_indicator


48164435
margin	height
Pattern(s): 5	
this question differs from others because the boxplot chart needs to be reduced in height and aligned to the left outer margin of the histogram


48167858
decoder	encoder
Pattern(s): 5	
bonus - useful resources intel xed can be handy in your struggles for several reasons it can be used as encoder decoder to validate other tools


48168384
freemarker	velocity	freemarker	thymeleaf	velocity	thymeleaf
Pattern(s): 10	
you can use template engines for these kind of requirements there are multiple template engines are available like apache velocity apache freemarker thymeleaf pebble but i feel apache freemarker is better


48169603
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 0	
the documentation for glibc stays they are integer types no narrower than unsigned int but i m not finding a standards reference that says they have to be an integer type see also time_t


48169782
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 5	
... ino_t shall be defined as unsigned integer types


48169793

Pattern(s): 5	
fsblkcnt_t fsfilcnt_t and ino_t shall be defined as unsigned integer types


48171833
bokeh	holoviews
Pattern(s): 10	
otherwise if you want a very high level api built on top of bokeh that supports more advanced interactive statistical and gis chart types have a look at holoviews


48172549
pascal	delphi
Pattern(s): 5	
examples include tp lex yacc ag tply delphi compiler generator so in short if what you are wanting to do can be expressed in lazarus fpc code there is a very good chance it can be executed in pascal script code


48172918
inline	inlining	inline-functions	inlining
Pattern(s): 7	
however if the compiler decides that it would rather not inline your static inline-functions either because it think s that inlining is worse or because inlining is impossible then it will have to make a separate copy of that function in each file it s used in


48175402
oncreate	recreate
Pattern(s): 5	
this would then cause the oncreate method to be invoked and recreate the table


48176877
16-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
incidentally that value can be stored in 48 bits but most systems don t have a 48-bit integer type so it will probably be stored in 64bit of which the high-order 16-bit will be zero. when you use an expression of one numeric type to initialize an object of a different numeric type the value is converted


48177296
hide	show
Pattern(s): 10	
to show and hide buttons i would use display like described here javascript style.display none or jquery hide is more efficient


48177498
keydown	keyup
Pattern(s): 10	10	
btw keydown event is usually more reliable if for some reason keyup is one off on results keydown is probably better


48178566
width	margin
Pattern(s): 0	
one way would be to remove the margin attribute or change the width to something lower than 100vw. what you are doing is saying the element should be as wide as the browser window 100 of the window width and then also saying that outside that width it should have more margin in your case 15px on the right and 260px on the left and that is streching the page causing the total widht to be larger than window width


48178603
range	median	median	rank
Pattern(s): 7	
let s say we want to find the median of the range starting at the second 2 inclusive and ending at the 1 exclusive . these are 7 elements thus the median has rank 4 fourth-smallest element in that range. now using a rank0 1 call in the root bitvector at the beginning and end of this range we find the corresponding range in the children of the root as you can see the left range which contains only smaller elements has only 3 elements thus the element with rank 4 must be contained in the right child of the root


48180140
ubuntu	centos
Pattern(s): 8	0	
i m new in ubuntu previously i tried to set this up on centos because i m more familiar with centos but it was worse than using ubuntu because many dependencies are missing out of date


48180936
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
initially i thought there is a chance that this might have something to do with the type and maybe using xor swap in int arrays would give a better results than on chars arrays so i ve built upon your benchmark one for int arrays just to text - turns out the same results more or less for int xor swap is just slower than using a temporary variable


48184869
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 10	
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case


48184869
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	0	
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also


48184869
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
configuring maven now we need to configure maven to use our file structure view toolchain_view vobs playvob toolchain 3p maven-repo as only central repository store the local repository below tmp and have the target directories also below tmp the first two can be configured in maven settings file but apparently the last one unfortunately seems to require specific changes in the pom.xml file


48212291
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
conversely if you actually want to use datetime fields you can use this if there s no intersection you ll get a negative number because the max start value is greater than the min end value


48212487
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the width is smaller than the height


48212487

48222143
multiplying	multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
it means that there might be two potential source of the performance difference you rounding up to more than 9 significant digits so the loop will be run more times if you multiplying first div96by32 might work slower if after multiplication the mantissa has more non-zero 32-bit words


48224886
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
the situation with private static bigdecimal computes int a the problem is that while i compile the program it make a incompatible types error telling me that bigdecimal cannot be converted to double wich seem to be a nonsence when you know that bigdecimal.divide bigdecimal int roundingmode dont need any double and his polymorphic methods neither.

48232390
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
what s weird however is that when i run these functions and receive the message from the pubsub the following is logged putting round end before take i never get to the after take which suggests to me that the channel doesn t have anything in it but i m pretty sure that isn t the case as it should have been put to in the event handler of the pubsub immediately prior


48232945
children	parent
Pattern(s): 1	
my solution is to create a myevent inside class a and myevent in class b i know probably is not so good as parent classes shouldn t know about children


48234046
width	height	children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
take the smallest value nb the argument of the function must be a span element or an element which is smaller than its parent otherwise if children and parent have both the same width height function will fail

for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
a while loops usually works better for what you re trying to accomplish than a for-loop


48240683
express	node.js
Pattern(s): 5	
for example you can use this workflow browser javascript code - make a ajax fetch api request to you service end point this service endpoint can be created using express - then when you hit this end point you can use node.js libraries to call the executable you wish in the express callback function and return a response like executable was executed


48243828

48247373
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
3 perform the iteration of loops before the _strlength .you place the wrong condition in for-loop which is less than equal to .because we start the character arrays to zero 0 till less than the size of string


48247677
zlib	libpng
Pattern(s): 5	
on windows you also need to have sdl_image.dll libpng and zlib dlls in your running directory


48248081
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
cut off the first 4 chars to get rid of var find the index of to cut out the substring representing the variable s name again cut off the leading chars to get rid of remove the trailing the remaining string now only contains values int or strings and commas so now is the time to use split separator to get the single values numeric values of course have to be parsed into int using int stringnum string values on the other hand have to be stripped of the leading and trailing quotes if the format is not 100 consistent or is more complicated than you showed in your example you should have a look at the scanner class


48251095

children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
or you can define a grandparent and then inherit it and make more than one parent and then again inherit it for children accordingly


48257747
pull	push
Pattern(s): 5	
as an example to obtain the second entry in that imaginary log file i would have done git pull # make changes to these files git add file3 file4 # verify changes run tests etc.. git commit -m correct typos git push in a nutshell git add and git commit lets you break down a change to the main repository into systematic logical sub-changes


48257787
pull	push

min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
i have tried to add required min and max


48260844
qthread	qfuture
Pattern(s): 5	
since i can t inherit from qthread so the best solution is to use qtconcurrent . i stored qtconcurrent result in a qfuture but as mentioned in the qt documentation the result of qtconcurrent can not be canceled by qfuture cancel


48261390
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
i have popupcontrol below is xaml for that - issue is i want to set auto height width for canvas or popup control so my popup will size as per content into it.i googled and knew that canvas should have fix height or width but is there any solution workaround to make popup auto sizable.or how can add scroller into popup


48262240
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 2	
now i can choose between google-chrome and firefox but choosing google-chrome will bring up the maps app


48266469
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 5	
this means that the first time you read a file it has to be pulled off disk but on subsequent occasions it may be already in ram


48266768
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
Pattern(s): 2	
personally i would recommend imagemagick over graphicsmagick with reasons as in the comments above


48267044
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
this works for me don t know why but need to use postdelayed to get it work. just post doesn t working


48274598
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i want to scale image to fit screen width and keep aspect ratio if image height is smaller than screen height


48275799
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 0	
use transform with boolean indexing detail another slowier solution with filtering timings setup caveat the results do not address performance given the number of grouping which will affect timings a lot for some of these solutions


48277808
width	height	portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 0	
the effect was that it makes the font size to fill width and if the text doesn t fit any more as it is the case in portrait mode on my tablet it replaces part of the text with ... also in landscape mode while most of the text fits perfectly in height the slash is bigger than the height and is partly outside the button at the bottom


48280229
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 0	
if your coordinates are each n-bit int this should be more space-efficient than boolean format as long as your sparsity is less than 1 n - 3 or so for 32-bit


48281811
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
you could try a sort order like order by case when parent_id is null then id else parent_id end asc id asc if indeed the id of the parent is lower then it s children then the parent will show first


48282229
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
the edges could be handled differently for example by testing if the 1st chord begins at 0 or not before loops but i feel that the single for-loop makes for cleaner code


48288961
decoder	encoder
Pattern(s): 10	10	
new java 8 encoder decoder is running faster than any other implementation but you need java 8...


48289732
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
note this is objective-c can be converted to swift over the years these emoji-detecting solutions keep breaking as apple adds new emojis w new methods like skin-toned emojis built by pre-cursing a character with an additional character etc


48290905
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
a crossover keeps the genetic information from both parent children are mirror images so one child will be worse than the parent and the other better or both the same


48292454
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
this means that the number of bytes is not a bit more than width x height x 3 but much less


48293288
portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 0	
this makes the landscape photos look much smaller than the portrait ones


48294355
integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 0	
however a large part of the range 57 1024 has fewer than 100 fractions per integer and in the interval 171 1024 there are only 10 fractions or fewer per integer


48294355
integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 0	
if you use the first 17 values as listed above this covers the part of the range with fewer than 100 fractions per integer so that would reduce the impact of rounding errors below 1


48300857
coalesce	isnull
Pattern(s): 7	
the generic sql solution uses coalesce in sql server isnull is a better choice for performance reasons


48301268
pull	push
Pattern(s): 10	
advantages are less spatial coupling - you send messages to the message broker without knowing where the receiver is located easier load balancing - you don t need any additional infrastructure except the message broker to run competing consumers pull model is more honest than the push model built-in retries for transient failures like database locks things like polly can help here too with http of course keep failures in the poison message queue for further analysis this is something that comes to my mind immediately


48302424
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 5	
the general idea of abstract classes and interfaces is to be extended implements by other classes cannot be constructed alone that use these general settings some kind of a template making it simple to set a specific-general behaviour for all the objects that later extends it


48308951
wildfly	jboss
Pattern(s): 1	
i am new to java and specially web service and just started working for a company which uses jboss eap server which is quite same as wildfly and unfortunately i am receiving same error there as well while working on a web service assignment


48309531
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
since the introduction of bool it has been a subclass of int and boolean can be cast into int implicitly this was for historical reasons compatibility with pre-2.3 apis


48317542
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 5	
i am using phpmyadmin version information 3.2.4 when i need to relation view it is not available that option then i search problem-solving this rule must be changed from myisam type to innodb


48318668
subtract	add	subtract	addition	subtraction	addition	subtraction	add	division	subtraction	division	addition	division	subtract
Pattern(s): 0	1	
similar to sam westrick s definition number of times you can subtract n2 from n1 without going negative you could also do integer division with addition and greater-than using the definition number of times you can add n2 to itself before it is greater than n1 . addition might seem like a conceptually simpler thing than subtraction


48320949
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
i got one solution but there are some limitations like the width of th and td will be fixed the height of the table will be fixed that solution is here jsfiddle i m trying to make the table with these properties responsiveness height and width dynamic width of td and th vertical and horizontal scroll-able with fixed thead with bootstrap table i have done this.


48323581
gson	jackson
Pattern(s): 5	
can it be done using gson or am i supposed to use something like jackson


48324007
prometheus	metrics
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem is that once i have set a metrics value for a particular set of labels even if that metrics is not collected again it will be scraped by prometheus until the application restarts and the metrics is removed from memory


48324007
prometheus	metrics
Pattern(s): 10	
this means that even if that metrics is no longer valid anymore hasn t been set again for a day say prometheus will still be scraping it as if it s a fresh metrics


48324651
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
Pattern(s): 0	
it is usually better than octal base 8 because each hex digit is 4 bits and binary data is usually arranged in clumps of powers of 2 due to how our computer bit-addressing works


48325855
comtypes	pywinauto
Pattern(s): 5	
in theory it might be fixed on comtypes side or by re-installing python to another folder like c python3x but you will have to run the script as administrator anyway because of other os restrictions pywinauto will warn about insufficient rights in nearest future now it s silent


48326866
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
to give an analogy this is like expecting a parser that reads character by character to realize that 1+2 3 is not 1+2 3 but 1+ 2 3 unless you specify somehow that multiplication has higher precedence over addition


48328546
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
as far as i am aware currently only swift classes that inherit from nsobject can be declared objective-c and bridged into an objective-c project


48331698
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
the value is no lower than min or the next integer greater than min if min isn t an integer and is less than but not equal to max


48337103
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 10	
your query will need to process quite a lot of rows and will likely never be subsecond however you re using the output of an analytic function as a filtering where grouping aggregation is more efficient so by rewriting your query as below you ll see a slight improvement


48337995
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the factors seem to be converted to int when an argument is converted to vector as you know data frames are lists of vectors of equal length so the first row of a data frame is also a list and when it is forced to be a vector something like this happens i don t know how apply achieves what it does factors are represented by chars values -- if you re interested look at its source code


48341151
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	10	
changing carousel height according to image height is a more common scenario whereas changing carousel width is more specific scenario


48344452
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 7	7	
compared with udp tcp generates more network traffic when the cluster size increases


48348827
qtreeview	qfilesystemmodel	qtreewidget	qfilesystemmodel	qtreewidget	qtreeview
Pattern(s): 3	
the answer would be the first option but for this type of tasks i do not recommend using qtreewidget since it has unnecessary elements causing the memory consumption to increase and the speed to decrease it would be appropriate to use qtreeview and create a custom model but if you want to show the information of the local files there is already a model that implements it qfilesystemmodel


48350872
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
after all that all it needed was the url to be https not http just in case it helps anyone else in the future in postman the url was just set as domain.co.uk but in my code i had put for the base url of the api so the api required all calls to be made using ssl

Pattern(s): 5	
screenshots of some steps 3. 4.1 4.2 the same could be done using qwidget as a base instead of qgraphicsview


48363752
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
your forms should be rendered as get methods and the data submitted as a post request


48364568
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 1	
obviously for-loop are very much r-like as loops are not very efficient in many cases


48366008
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 10	
also i do not know which serializable deserialization method is more suitable for such a use case


48367224
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 0	
they are safer than strcpy by providing the buffer size of the destination similar to strncpy


48373620
oncreate	ondestroy
Pattern(s): 5	
just to add to the answers above if you register a receiver in on oncreate it should be unregistered in ondestroy


48377760
post	get
Pattern(s): 3	
for this scenario i prefer using post get directly instead of using resources because i am not forced to use a specific function name such as create especially if the controller of your nested resource has only one endpoint function users admin with post


48378530
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 5	
alternatives would have been strcpy or strncpy but as length including the trailing null character


48382153
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
Pattern(s): 5	
but the problem is as soon as i click on the jdatepickerimpl component i get an exception error awt-eventqueue-0 java.lang.classcastexception java.util.date cannot be cast to java.util.calendar at utility.date.datelabelformatter.valuetostring datelabelformatter.java 26 so i thought maybe i could use the setdate int int int method of it s jdatepanelimpl instance


48382455
hive	hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
when you creates a table in hive then what happens behind the scene is it stores the metadata in some relational database depending on which is configured for your environment and actual data will be stored on hdfs warehouse directory if that is managed table


48383448
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 5	
when you use cursor.commit after the numerous insert s you are effectively executing one database transaction and the data is stored in ram in the interim it may be written to disk but not all at the time when you instruct the database to finalize the transaction


48388047
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 3	
unless there s a feature of myisam that you can t get with innodb i would highly recommend using innodb and optimizing where necessary

48394676
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
i need help with the following case statement the problem is the 4 values h u8 a oh are datatype varchar 10 and obviously contain a non-numeric chars therefore they cannot be converted to int i think


48395285
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	0	
note it s not a good idea to cast it into int value because max double value is greater than max int value


48395542
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
after banging my head against the screen for an hour i figured it was all my mistake actually map json is another extension that needs to be imported into maven pom.xml


48398769
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
means i want you to think as parent-children relationship where provider would be in parent and all the store actions and subscriptions should be done in children


48401319
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 7	
minimum deployment target for xcode 9 is 8.0 not 7.0 with coding there is no problem but xcode 9 storyboard add safearea for running layout properly in iphone x also i don t think there is users now running ios 7 regarding swift or objective-c you can accomplish anything with any of them but swift is much easier all tutorial now written in swift for new features every wwdc


48403229
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 3	
the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself if you want to sort your items by let s say name here it goes in your html


48404295
scipy	scikit-learn
Pattern(s): 10	
scipy supports some scikit-learn is even more complete and imho better and more actively developed for these tasks


48409865
mailgun	mailchimp
Pattern(s): 5	
to send emails using mailgun and mailchimp so that it comes from your domain an dns txt record needs to be added mailgun advises using a subdomain i do not know why and the record looks like this thus i understand it sends email from the mg.expertbox.com domain mailchip assumes the root domain is used to send and requires the following no option to specify subdomain so this assumes sending from the root domain


48410134
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 10	
although many short articles on the web comparing mysql and postgresql generally tend to claim that postgresql is technically more advanced acid json support etc.. these two problems seem to be serious drawback to me


48410373
onmouseover	onclick
Pattern(s): 5	
there are a few problems onclick should be lowercase as onclick onmouseover should be lowercase as onmoueover onmouseout should be lowercase as onmouseout some browsers tolerate the incorrect capitalisation and some do not which would explain the inconsistencies between them


48411603
hive	hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
external table can only be read by hive but not managed by hdfs


48411622
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
about replication mysql has had a replication solution much earlier than postgresql


48412607
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
when use_natural_primary_keys true is specified django will not provide the primary key in the serializable data of this object since it can be calculated during deserialization


48417391
background-color	transparency
Pattern(s): 10	
your code is redundant with background transparency and with background-color transparency it s better to use however you can act directly to your in your css adding


48420394
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
i have a simple class and a mvc controller method i am calling the controller method via jquery-ajax this works perfectly fine with google-chrome and firefox


48420673
min	max
Pattern(s): 1	
for example take image_arrow_up.jpg you can set it s size with another way would be to use percentages although this is not as concrete as min and max another option is to use css with the image-set function or with scrset + sizes it also helps to make sure the original image is sized appropriately


48420681
public	protected
Pattern(s): 5	
add access modifiers to function class properties must be defined as public private or protected


48421212
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
i try below code here calculate min and max time is but slider hours is started from min - 04 18 and max - 45 18 i need min - 04 30 and max - 45 38


48421839
loops	while-loop
Pattern(s): 5	
as a counter it is used in the while-loop or the do-while-loop the variable will be incremented value will be increased inside loops and loops will continue as long as the condition remains true what role does it have here a i


48424198
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	0	
i want to make the img fit the div height if it is smaller than the width or fit the div width if it is smaller than the height i want this to work well even when the img is small i want it to stretch to fit the max-height of the div or stretch to fit the 100 width of the div without losing the aspect ratio this is where i am so far


48435149
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 10	
then method 2 significant performance improvement this uses the same idea expressed in the last section of my answer comparison to tai s method that int indexing is faster than boolean indexing for small number of expected elements to be selected and avoids creating an initial index at all


48435149
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 10	
for a small number of selected elements int indexing is faster than boolean indexing making this method more efficient than tai s method even after tai optimized his code


48435517
portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 7	
since the screen size for portrait is less than 480px but if i rotate its more than 480px in landscape mode which makes it medium size as per tachyons


48438662
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0


48441240
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the returned value is of type int which is wider than chars since it can also return eof for when input reading failed generally because the stream was closed


48441529
imagemagick	libtiff
Pattern(s): 7	
so i plotted the first scanline of the image as calculated by libtiff green and as shown by imagemagick purple here i zoom in on the left side - you can see they both start at column 165 and here i zoom in on the right side it looks like one imagemagick has a lower radiometric resolution fewer bits for the pixel brightness than the other because it is more stepped but sometimes it seems downright lazy and is totally static when it clearly could represent more accurate values


48442999
timeit	itertools
Pattern(s): 0	
anyway using ipython s timeit we see that the manual approach with checks on the fly is still about three times slower than using itertools so even improving the checks will probably not make it faster than that


48444052
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 0	
so i was trying to make my modal only work on screens smaller than tablet


48444405
build.gradle	gradlew

48446187
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 3	
i will recommend using settimeout instead setinterval try this


48454696
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 10	
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case


48454696
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	0	
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also


48454696
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior


48455236
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 7	
2 errors when i do either this is what happens in my computer 1 cmd processors consumes more than 60 of cpu and memory and runs for a while. 2 it then gives out error messages


48457440
onresume	onpause
Pattern(s): 5	
probably onpause should be replaced with onresume and vice versa


48461995
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
so there are some parent name s that have more than one children of course


48465475
public	protected
Pattern(s): 5	
the functions setg setp gbump and pbump are protected members and would not be called by public member functions by default so you needn t worry about them


48467869
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
if you determine the parent s split axis to be z to children share a boundary on the xy plane then your ray s direction in z is negative -.707 and you should traverse the child whose centroid has the lower z coordinate first


48468612
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
Pattern(s): 1	0	0	
in some cases calloc is also much faster than malloc memset .


48471998
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 5	
when the system is running low on real memory ram things in memory that are not actively being used can be written to disk and loaded back into ram later


48472127

Pattern(s): 0	
by enabling the configuration setting multidexenabled you are telling android it is ok to generate more than 1 dex file for the apk


48475612
mono	xamarin.android
Pattern(s): 7	
by default xamarin.android uses the older mono managed httpclient handler that does not support tls 1.2


48476029
atof	strtod
Pattern(s): 7	
or even better alk suggested about the input part you can do this though instead of using atof it is much better to use strtof or strtod functions


48477903
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
that is because a you don t know if the file is a complete number of int but it is of chars bytes and b in the printf call the chars will be converted to int and would the high bit of the chars be a 1 it would be sign-extended which we don t want


48479810
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 10	
while sync is paused your google drive folder acts more like a normal directory


48480518
lapply	rep
Pattern(s): 7	
for fun it s also possible to just use rep but lapply is cleaner i think


48481994

lxml	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 10	
for beautifulsoup the code like as following the lxml is more quickly


48487080
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to do int division use double slash if you want to convert whatever into int without knowing whether it can use this function def try_int v try return int v except valueerror return v then you ll be able to convert only those that are able to be converted into int into int


48489845
removeclass	next
Pattern(s): 5	
its enough to use data attribute and with a little work with add removeclass you ll be done next snippet to test the code working correctly or not by using settimeout the click stops and you ve to wait 3 second after click the code after added ajax to it


48490567
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
strangely i get different values for the frame width and height for both views when i printed them to stdout main view width 768.0 height 1024.0 second view width 375.0 height 667.0 i do not understand why these values are not equal because both views have the same size when running and the grey second view is greater than a width of 375


48491100
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 1	
unsigned types at least as wide as unsigned int do not undergo integer promotions so arithmetic and logical operations on them is applied in their own type for which johan lundberg s answer applies that s specified to be performed modulo 2 n


48493387
subtract	add
Pattern(s): 5	
when is added to a the semantics is governed by 6.5.6 8 which says that pointer arithmetic can be used to add to or subtract from a pointer as long as the result points to another element in the same array or to one beyond the last element


48500009
scala	typesafe

if someone more familiar with mocha sinon could help me figure out how to do this i would greatly appreciate it


48511967
printf	strcmp
Pattern(s): 5	
when reading the header you need to specify the number of characters of the magic number to read to be used with strcmp the last byte in the array must be set to 0 when writing the header you need to write it as an string printf out_file s d d d header.magic_number header.height header.width header.max_color

since i don t know how long the text will be i want all the available text to be filled up in columns according to the available space column width can be fixed max height is the viewport height


48529485
realloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
at least couple of reasons comes to my mind you need to work with c code library and pass pointer there that expected to be initialized by malloc you are limited with resources and want to be able to use realloc with it there could be more but you need to be careful when working with raw pointers either initialized by new or malloc


48529485
memset	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
also you need to remember that with malloc you need to be sure that memory is properly initialized it can be done with memset or simple assignments with pod types or and this is mandatory for non pod through placement new

Pattern(s): 10	
a normal linear regression model yields practically the same results as an anova but is much more flexible regarding variable choice


48561720
sigkill	setsid
Pattern(s): 5	
doing the following in the child process for that purpose is pointless that is because this child_group is just a copy in the child process the child_group in the parent process doesn t get modified sigkill has to be send to the pgid that corresponds to the child s pid because it becomes a process group leader by means of setsid


48563469

some good ones i ve used are solr and xapian though if you re already familiar with whoosh it certainly sounds like the best option you proposed


48570303
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the long answer is with a properly initialized array it still depends c in the expression will be promoted to int prior to computing the array index and the c standard mandates that a have a positive value regardless of whether type chars is signed or unsigned


48575039
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
from tfs 2015 update 3 upgrade your tfs if your versioning is lower than this update 3 there is a task named delete files you could add this task after visual studio test task to delete the .itrace files

width	height
Pattern(s): 1	
clearly we can see that width of column is not same as height of row


48595336
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
what it does is simply after each items content is subtracted share the negative space like this in the right column and 18 is the sum of all items flex-shrink value c gets 4 18 d gets 12 18 e gets 2 18 these values can either be calculated server-side and assigned inline or client-side using a script


48595608
children	parent
Pattern(s): 1	
what it means is that to setup a piping you need a parent-child relationship not that communication with pipe is only possible between parent and children


48596390
hide	show
Pattern(s): 5	
for example you could hide the ones that could not be loaded show a custom error image using background-image or style them as you wish like in this example the problem is that the spinner image you use initially might take some time to load


48597795
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
now width is less than height when i check getclientrect .width and getclientrect height which is expected but it now won t drag all the way to the end of my canvas unless i detect end of rotation and change my shapes offsety value to 65 and then it works fine


48599841
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
sum needs to be declares as double because int will treat truncate all decimals. 1 i need to be type-casted as double as i is int so 1 i will be treated as int so it ll give 1 for and 0 for all values


48600783
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	5

- i suppose it make the children circles bigger than the parent circle


48614101
printf	fgets
Pattern(s): 5	
the code is correct apart from the #include string.h which should be 1 the problem is that when you press ctrl + d on your terminal your terminal might write something on the terminal which you cannot control and this output might be d after fgets returns null you do printf d n found


48615436
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
to fix this you have two options either have the caller of text provide a pointer to store the string to or have text malloc some memory for the string and return that relying on the calling function to free it when it is done

width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
you can try expand barcode width and height if barcode height is less from standart


48624014
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 5	
an alternative to implementing dispatch on multiple inherited is to flatten the hierarchy into a single class and give it a single method that takes a descriptor of what kind of import to do static dynamic etc. as its parameter in turn importtype enumeration could be enhanced with properties and methods directing the process of importing excel data into your application

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
using a for-loop if your constraint is that the usernames and passwords must be stored in arrays and you all this in a single test case your only solution is to use a loops


48656681
keydown	keyup
Pattern(s): 10	
edit 3 in a comment below the linked solution from this stackoverflow question does not cover all the cases because the disable action prevent the keyup event to be triggered and - on the other side - the keydown event is to earlier because when the button is hit a new section is created obviously by another keydown handler somewhere else and no i cannot modify that handler directly


48658614
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 5	5	
if you have rename installed a.k.a perl rename you can do it very simply with a one-liner including making the target directory sample output other_sh would be renamed to folder other_priv sample1_sh would be renamed to folder sample1_priv when you become more familiar with the switches that will become even shorter if you are not that familiar with perl there are two substitutions going on in the middle there separated by a comma the first substitution replaces which means start of line with the prefix folder

this is received on the react native side and it displays however i am reading the data on react native side as - it gives error json value nsnull cannot be converted into nsstring


48663802
next	addclass
Pattern(s): 5	
found the issue the output element can t be hidden when rendering otherwise it will not work it s probably optimization feature and maybe because addclass don t wait for the class to be addded before next line is executed so the rendertext got not visible output


48663984
int	chars
Pattern(s): 10	10	
say we attempt to overload functions with arguments as int chars and another as chars int if i call the function with chars chars would this be ambiguous or call to chars int is more logical


48664324

48669911
calloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 10	
when you want to allocate memory via functions as malloc and calloc it is better that you use a variable for the size of memory to be allocated


48671212
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 1	
catch an exception-handling only if you know how you can usefully continue even knowing that some previous step failed - and very often you can t so surrounding only top-level actions with try-catch there logging the exception-handling to some log file and informing the user often is the best thing you can do

48684590
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
i have tried the following approach draw a bounding rectangle around the nonzero pixels in the image and apply condition based on its height and width my code is something like draw a rotated rectangle and and then do the same procedure for condition check using its width and height. code the problem is that in most of the cases the horizontal aligned text has a rectangle with height greater than width and vice-versa therefore incorrect structuring size is applied and hence the system fails to join the correct contours in morphological operation


48685292
children	parent
Pattern(s): 1	
originally i was using the vue.component method in my main app.js file to require numerous single file components which were only used once as children of other parent components

post	put
Pattern(s): 5	
in your current schema that means running two queries first to retrieve reported post ids from your reports collection matching the user and then running the query like if you are able to just put the reports in the user schema it s easier as it saves a query but i recognize there are cases where it s better to have them in their own collection too


48696242

48737898
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
then the trick is to make the whole svg to overflow with big width height to always cover the div and to keep the same size of the circle if you want the circle to be resized on width change you can try this and you can easily have the opacity you needed in the previous question


48748015

48748665
width	height	portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 0	
however because the thumbnail images are a set width and portrait images are different proportions they have a much greater height than the landscape ones when scaled down which obviously looks very wrong


48749278
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
what you are looking for is a layout bucket with the smallest width qualifier . a layout with a set smallest width will be active unless the smaller of the both dimensions width or height is lower than a certain value you can choose


48750435
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 10	
the set accessor is more complicated because you ll need to loop over the attribute cache for the properties and call each attribute s check method


48750713
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 10	
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case


48750713
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	0	
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git you can generate annotated tags instead of lightweight tags with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also


48750713
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

ubuntu	linux	sysv	systemd
Pattern(s): 5	
the section of that file that contains the info for __gi_raise has the following attributes that indicate where the source code might be found on ubuntu 16.04 ubuntu doesn t ship source code in the base distribution so your systemd doesn t have any glibc source in build glibc-cl5g7w glibc-2.23 so gdb looks unsuccessfully for raise.c in a few other directories according to its rules specifying source directories and eventually gives up with the error message 54 .. sysdeps unix sysv linux raise.c no such file or directory. then ddd calls sourceview full_path .. sysdeps unix sysv linux raise.c to canonicalize the pathname taking your working directory into account and displays the error dialog box in your question

children	parent
Pattern(s): 2	
in the second step i read the children match document by parent id and update with child.


48753649
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
if anyone could explain why the for-loop is faster than the direct access of the arrays that would be great. for reference the shape of matrix_n is 48 100 100 30 and the shape of matrix is 48 30 100 100 so in the second method im simply building the arrays from the 2nd dimension and in the first method the arrays is already built


48755555
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
i suggest to use idling resources to handle async ops anyway exception-handling is a checked exception-handling so it should be wrapped with try-catch or method should define that exception-handling with throws keyword. to fix your compiler error you may use runtimeexception or error


48756630
dplyr	tidyr
Pattern(s): 5	
a very generic solution can be achieved using dplyr and tidyr packages


48759492
min	max
Pattern(s): 1	
and as others posted here there also appears to be many plugins making that even simpler a few of which show up in those searches i listed above such as min max quantity please see if you try implementing those hit a wall and cant find anything after searching for a while to work around it


48760962
comparator	comparable
Pattern(s): 5	
if your linked list must be sorted using comparator then you need to make sure that the underlying data is comparable


48761669
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0


48764066
min	max	minimum	max
Pattern(s): 7	
like if max 20 than you can enter maximum 20 character. and here min is lower bound so you have to enter minimum 4 character


48768124
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
otherwise i would not be surprised if malloc free internally holds a similar array or linked list of recently used memory blocks ready to be recycled


48768469
maven	pom.xml	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 8	
since the classes may get recycled or the groovy class loader isolation magic loads it differently our environment eclipse neon 3 uses groovy 2.4.5 internally starts with a jdk 1.8.0_121 jaspersoft studio 6.3.2.final we have a 6.3.0 server but full neon support was added in 6.3.1 so we took the last patch versioning of 6.3.x we had issues before where newer studio versioning did not work with older servers so we are more careful with upgrade here may be irrelevant it was enough to just depend on the slf4j api 1.7.12 in our case in the pom.xml we have both provided jasper libraries added to the project jaspersoft server library jasperreports library dependencies we also depend on server functionality so we also have jasperreports-6.3.0.jar in the pom.xml and some not via some public maven repo available server jars as a user library to the project which we copied over from the server no groovy reference in the pom.xml


48769111
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 1	
the fix is to redirect stderr or redirect both stdout and stderr background when processes are initially created they generally always have three initial file descriptors already opened for them 0 stdin standard input a read-only stream 1 stdout standard output a write-only stream 2 stderr standard error a write-only stream there is precisely zero difference between stdout and stderr other than convention and the file descriptor number


48771440
exponent	modulo
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i can t create a a new .jks file using instructions here create new jks it gives me error java.security.invalidkeyexception exponent is larget than modulo make sure the ca files are in der format


48771825
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
you are using url with https that require ssl certificate which is secure and i think you may not have configured ssl certificate for your web page so just use only http


48775777
dplyr	tidyr
Pattern(s): 5	
this can be accomplished with dplyr and tidyr packages although it is a bit involved


48776202
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
if your conditions are true that only the lines you need are longer than 12 chars and that the lines you are interested are always of the same format no spaces between the commas second column is always quotes as the ones posted in your answer then you can parse it like this now the interesting bits are these strtol is a function that converts a number in a string to an actual int


48777275
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
google-chrome is more picky about js errors than firefox


48780283
3des	aes
Pattern(s): 10	
this seems like a step backwards as aes is the current standard while 3des is no longer recommended


48782304
versioning	upgrade	next	except

if the next versioning is published will the users of previous versioning be asked to upgrade to the latest versioning without any code for upgrade except the versioning detail


48783217
portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 0	
the values really seem to be correct in the landscape the r value is bigger than in portrait


48784645
tensorflow	cudnn
Pattern(s): 5	
according to tensorflow 1.5 installation instructions for ubuntu 16.04 you need to install cudnn 7.0 but they don t mention exactly what should be installed cudnn v7.0


48785784
cos	sin	cos	sqrt	sin	sqrt
Pattern(s): 5	
u is the free parameter but its range is limited by the third equation sin v sqrt 1 Î³ cosh u + cos Î± sin Î± sinh u this can be rewritten as sin v -sin alpha sinh u sqrt 1-y cosh u +cos alpha knowning that abs sin v 1 gives a condition for u


48785911
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
why matrix in i+1 is not defined meanwhile it works properly for matrix i simply because of your for-loop condition value of i can go upto matrix.length -1 and will always be undefined as arrays indexing starts from 0


48787211
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0


48789403
libtiff	freetype
Pattern(s): 5	
also note that and delegates will also need to be included libtiff ghostscript and freetype for example if your planing to support additional formats features


48792647
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
the idea is set the component s width to the available width the height you set do not matter so i just pass zero and get preferred height will be the height for the wrapped content


48793811
udp	rtp
Pattern(s): 5	
- + - and then set udp port 4000 to be decoded as rtp by selecting rtp under the current column


48794167
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
also in drawrect what you do with the while loops is correct but a for-loop is more common for this purpose


48794936
uwsgi	daphne
Pattern(s): 5	
the documentation mentions that the server needs to be run with daphne and daphne needs an asynchronous version of uwsgi named asgi


48795857
margin	height
Pattern(s): 10	
and then set height 50 to elements in your columns i add a margin it looks better


48797480
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
personally if i were going to use the button idea as you ve described i would probably have hidden checkbox and use client-side javascript to check uncheck them as the button or image is pressed


48797974
mdx	dax
Pattern(s): 5	
have discovered that dax is the wrong place to implement this - we are doing this in mdx

google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 10	10	
safari says enter a valid value. google-chrome says please enter a valid value


48800317
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
i think your image height is much greater than match_parent its attr. and again imageview s scale type forces image to resize width in accordance to its height and hence the blank space


48803120
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 0	
yes on most cpus sha-256 is two to three times slower than md5 though not primarily because of its longer hash


48809189

since it s not running as a listening server i can t use nginx node_cgi is not mature with apache how am i supposed to run this sample


48810588
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 7	
--a union approach seems more straight forward if you can guarantee that only status 2 records get mapped the union could be a union all to gain a bit of performance by avoiding the distinct


48813171
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 5	
this gets to be a headache because of git s default behavior that once you exclude a folder any exceptions within it will never be found directory vs directory


48815201
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
in your case writes 5 as int which has a bigger size than chars 2 4 8 depends


48817691
haskell	idris
Pattern(s): 7	
if a is false then nothing is said about b which seems right for case expressions and may mean the same as or it may have the meaning for functions given below which is means the function f maps the set x into the set y so my guess is that idris just uses for the narrow second meaning for mapping one type to another in type signatures whereas haskell uses the broader interpretation where it means the same as


48823369
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to run commands from your terminal interactively as root do it as follows sudo -i if just want to run a single command do it as sudo some-command-goes-here you will not be prompted for passwd in any of these scenario


48826347
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
in your class constructor this capacity++ will first return the capacity and then increase its value by one. because of this when you are filling your arrays in a for-loop you are going out of arrays range because your arrays size is 1 less than the capacity value


48826829
loops	while-loop
Pattern(s): 5	
while-loop syntax if we have only single statement to execute within our loops i.e in our case while-loop then we can either write form 1 or we can write it as form 2 while expression statement 1 note if we write one more statement below statement 1 in form 2 then it will not be executed within loops body

48832098
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 0	
treating numerical data as numerical data and in a dataframe is far easier than maintaining spaces delimiter string conversions imo


48833957
dependencyobject	uielement

multipart forms can t be submitted via get you ll have to use post when you use get the params just end up in the url which cannot store a file


48834818
ienumerable	iequalitycomparer
Pattern(s): 1	
you can create a custom iequalitycomparer that only compares on the column needed and use the except that takes an iequalitycomparer as an argument or you can use exceptby from morelinq or you could do your own exceptby equivalent public function check_desparity byval dtteststeps as datatable byval dtlimits as datatable as ienumerable of datarow dim dtteststepshash as new hashset of string dtteststeps.asenumerable.select function dr ctype dr dictkey string return dtlimits.asenumerable.where function dr not dtteststepshash.contains ctype dr dictkey string end function i assumed column dictkey was of type string but you can just put in the correct type

example i have one web page which displays contents which will be break into several pages for printing the first 2 part of contents will be printed in portrait and the others will be printed in landscape


48840250
octal	hex
Pattern(s): 5	
whereas the first code prints 291.0 83.0 83.0 the second code prints 4671.0 123.0 123.0 ideone demo because the f on 0x123f is considered a hex digit and the leading 0 on 0123f and 0123d doesn t cause floating point numbers to be considered in octal


48842210
data-uri	data-url
Pattern(s): 10	
if you only generate a thumbnail i would recommend moving image loading into the promise as well as that makes more sense over all since image loading is asynchronous. now you can use the call as any promise or also a small note by separating the header from the data-uri it s no longer a data-url just a base-64 encoded string - something to consider for the function name


48843829
typedef	struct
Pattern(s): 0	
before this lines there are more than 6k typedef struct like this and even that i make comments over each typedef struct to catch the mistake i couldn t figure out how


48847794
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 5	
additional benefit is that when you ve processed few millions of input data pages these gbs will be unloaded from ram and you ll never need them again so you won t pollute actual disk cache


48850848
virtualenv	conda	virtualenv	miniconda
Pattern(s): 10	
if you do not want use conda instead virtualenv select virtualenv but virtualenv from miniconda as far as miniconda is more tested and work out of the box without such errors


48852377
width	height

but i would suggest to use the following the max function so that all the points are covered in the maximum value of x and y provided x y are always less than width and height


48854160
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
i am a microsoft fan but mssql server costs much more than postgresql or mysql


48855205
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
short int is an int type so bullet #2 kicks in and causes generation of a wrapper which calls double abs double and this wrapper is a better match than int abs int


48856657
multiplying	multiplication
Pattern(s): 8	
depending on the scale a tree-fold rather than a strict left-fold can improve the performance of doing lots of multiplication because multiplying numbers of approximately the same magnitude is more efficient than multiplying one large and one small number


48857063
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
hiding dropdowns can be done with -webkit-appearance none note that these vendor prefixes are unique to their corresponding browsers so if you were to apply -webkit-appearance none like above the dropdowns will be hidden on google-chrome but still visible on firefox


48857130
for-loop	arrays	primes	modulus

max solution runs certainly faster that row_number solution because max complexity is o n while row_number complexity is at minimum o n.log n where n represent the number of records in table


48887925
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 5	5	
you can either decorate your productviewmodel with the bind attribute as follows this will of course mean all the properties in the tblproduct will be bound when submission if you do not want all of the properties to be bound on submit for tblproduct then you can decorate the tblproduct with the bind attribute as follows more reading at msdn


48893308
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 0	
as far as i know this problem occur when we paste image from explorer to drawable folder then it ask weather to copy drawable or drawable-v24 and if you have pasted images in both directory structures or have one more images with different directory structure then it will show this error make sure to copy image only in drawable directory structure


48894473

tidyverse	tidyr
Pattern(s): 5	
this can be done employing tidyr package included in tidyverse in r


48899569
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
it isn t a great solution because client-side code should generally be decoupled with server-side code and with this approach you ll have to manage your routes at both the client and the server ends but it will do what you want perhaps


48899649
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
i have two tables with same width and number of in one row with same css for both tables but as you see in snippet first column of both tables are aligned properly but other columns are shifted left from heading here i want a table with fixed headings at top and content part has scroll if content height is more than 100px


48900376
memcpy	qsort
Pattern(s): 7	
also since the whole point of this thing seems to be to have a faster sort than std stable_sort and std sort due to qsort avoidance of assignment operator btw qsort is generally slower than std sort for cheap comparers because it requires an indirect call for each compare while in std sort the functor gets inlined. and copying is often slower as well as std sort has to use memcpy which has to be called and then to determine at runtime the size and copy accordingly while an inlined assignment gets inlined so again it s way cheaper if your elements are small and pretty much the same otherwise as the synthesized assignment copy of trivially assignable types generally boils down to memcpy chat link

you can also clone to your main python site-packages the application s commands in order to have the auto-completation. if i remember nuke has already a clone for autocompletion but maya is more tricky


48903188
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
this means we will have more height than width on this page so width is decisive for a quadratic frame


48904006
pow	sqrt
Pattern(s): 0	5	
it works even better when the power is higher but might not be good with powers smaller than 1 indeed pow is a really slow function even slower than sqrt which make sense since any sqrt operation could be done with pow using a fraction as exponent there is no way to compute the power exactly more efficiently but there are pretty good way to estimate it


48905894
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
the problem is when the items count gets more than views height every item that is in the view will get a width of highest content i mean all will get wrap content of highest width


48905894
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
here is my code the xml layout for items code snippet that does the fragment replace and the mainpageframelayout the adapter and the oncreateview images edit image explanation as you can see in image 1 when items numbers gets more than views height items width gets wrap_content instead of match_parent image 2 is the correct one that it should be in image 3 as you can see after i did scroll items that get s re-instantiated gets correct width


48911802
int	chars
Pattern(s): 8	
here is a slightly more complex example with chars int instead of a and b the function lt in sortwith behaves like the second function g2fun whereas the function aux2 that you have written is more like the g1fun


48911977
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
there is always a chars at the beginning of the string but it may or may not be followed by int

it can be done through sympy which will call mpmath it s not quite clear how you plan to plot this function given that it s complex-valued


48916009
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
because the 1st example also has double i d expect all of those elements to be converted to double as well and the sum being 2.0 before being cast to 2 but the result is 0 so it seems the 1 2 is being treated as int giving a result of 0

git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 10	
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case


48925696
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	0	
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git you can generate annotated tags instead of lightweight tags with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also


48925696
git-svn	svn2git
Pattern(s): 7	
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

post	get
Pattern(s): 7	0	
a post is semantically better than get because the concept of a job is to do some processing rather than getting something for you


48947161
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want them parsed to int this will work mind you that there should be some error checking here the above example will crash if any of the chars cannot be parsed to int

oncreate	setcontentview
Pattern(s): 5	
changing app theme requires settheme method to be called before setcontentview .. in the oncreate method of the activity


48949147
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 5	
as a rule of thumb you should use the prototype scope for all beans that are stateful while the singleton scope should be used for stateless beans


48949670
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	
since the height of all children combined is greater than that of wrapper div i want the parent to be able to scroll


48953983
min	max	next	except
Pattern(s): 5	
it cannot be supplied except from the list to be analyzed. next the basis of a tail recursive function is the accumulator. the accumulator is where the last min or max value is stored and passed to the the function to compare to the next value of the list. a basic function could be the first parameter is a guess at a value higher than any in the list and is destined to fail and cannot be automated

google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
by the looks of the browser compatibility table at the bottom of the mdn documentation page array.prototype.values won t be supported until google-chrome 66 and firefox 60 - neither of which have been released yet


48965200
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
if the number is revised 1519490351963 this exceeds the greater value of an int 2147483647 so there is no conversion to whole a possible solution is to convert it to double another possible solution is to convert it to qvariant and then use tolonglong to use qlonglong which is a type of int that supports more bits


48966859
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	7	
like described in this question iterating an arrays with a for-loop is less cheaper than using a foreach


48969103
min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
so to bind step to simulationparametersconfig.param1.step you would change to naturally the same could be done to min and max as well


48969843

the basic problem is that i am using word32 to represent the package length and one of the pcap packets is shorter than 47


48970962
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
perhaps you are thinking about the initializer functions that convert between strings and int values and vice versa using an arbitrary radix but that only applies when the hex string is less than 8 chars can be represented in 64 bits


48972211
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
i have these value so what i m doing is that i m generating a random number between min and max with these rules min not less than 100 max not more than 800 i only want to have +200 from previous or -200 from previous so for the above example the random number should be between min 100 and max 370


48973798
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 5	
as this particular machine could easily buffer 20 gbytes in ram we shall do another run with to force any data that may only have been in the kernel s ram cache at the end of the run to be pushed to disk thus ensuring we record the time it took for all the data to actually reach non-volatile storage ok now the speed has dropped to about 1.9 gbytes s and we still use all a cpu but the disk in the raid device claim they had capacity to go faster


48977796
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 7	
the general feel has always been that nginx is lighter and easier to configure but on the flip side perhaps isn t as fully featured as apache because of that


48978696
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
you can assign a new arrays of true values with the same element count but interestingly assigning true values in a for-loop is much faster

firefox column floated right issue image i am using firefox quantum 58.0.2 64bit and have tried latest google-chrome edge and opera which works fine


48980889
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
you can compare two byte arrays without for-loop using zip method but it will create a new list so it will be slower than the for-loop method


48983956
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 10	8	
the recursive settimeout is a more flexible method than setinterval


48986915

Pattern(s): 5	
indexeddb data can be viewed within google-chrome firefox and opera developer tools


48990165
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0. element to be clickable elementtobeclickable by locator an expectation for checking an element is visible and enabled such that you can click it. note as per the docs element is clickable - it is displayed and enabled


48991349
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
a double for-loop would do but i found that eigen vectorxd s are faster than hand-written loops


48991457
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 5	
you can use the appropriate integer literal suffix to force the foo to be deduced as unsigned long


48993311

uistackview	uicollectionview
Pattern(s): 3	
first i would recommend using uicollectionview uistackview for this issue second changing frame width won t help every item appended should have leading constraint to the previous trailing top bottom trailing to contentview then scrollview will autoresize to show that added item


48995270
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
when int i is declared outside the for-loop it can be accessed outside the for-loop and inside but when you define it inside loops it can only be used inside loops


48995693
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
clemens already gave you a handful of options to remedy this situation in the comments section but let me quickly go over them set width and height of your ellipse to the same value - this is limiting since you have to hard-code the size of your control bind the width to the actualheight of the ellipse or the other way around - this gives you some extent of dynamic behavior but things go bad if the target dimension constraint is smaller than the source dimension constraint if you bind width to actualheight things go bad when your control is contained within a rectangle with its width smaller than its height - the ellipse is clipped put the ellipse in a square container - or more precisely within a container that would always arrange it in a square i strongly recommend the last approach since it gives you full flexibility in sizing your control


48998906
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you can see the relative sizes of them on your particular computer using this simple program if you run that you re going to notice that the chars is smaller than the int


48998906
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
if you really want your variables to be chars you need to first use scanf to store them into an int and then assign the values to your resulting chars while you re checking that they re in range since an int can hold a bigger number than a chars

swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
when ns_enum makes a difference if you are writing objective-c which will be used by swift then using ns_enum does make a difference an enum declared using ns_enum will be imported as a swift enum


49018633
ienumerable	iqueryable
Pattern(s): 10	
iqueryable is faster than ienumerable if we are dealing with huge amounts of data from database because iqueryable gets only required data from database where as ienumerable gets all the data regardless of the necessity from the database


49019403
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
i have no interest in using node.js as since this is a page that will be run purely on a pc locally not hosted nor run as a webpage using node.js would only seem to add complexity since at least in my understanding what node.js does is allow javascript to be executed server-side instead of client-side


49020065
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 5	
i have come across a strange c++ crash recently after upgrading to gcc 7.2 which can be demonstrated using the following simple complete c++11 program the program can be built using g++ -std c++11 -o2 when executed with no arguments - program takes the top branch and crashes when built with gcc6.1 or later

swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
so while cf types are not classes objects they act like objects and several are actually interchangeable with objective-c and swift objects


49028635
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 8	
to avoid these linkage errors you must inform your c++ compiler when it compiles the header file s of libeapi that the declarations therein have external c linkage so it will emit unmangled references to the symbols declared like so main.cpp btw this commandline g++ -o secotest -lpthread main.o libeapi.a will fail to link libpthread on a debian-based distro ubuntu et al more recent than debian 6 as all libraries must be linked in dependency order since then g++ -o secotest main.o libeapi.a -lpthread even better do not use the non-portable -lpthread and pass the portable option -pthread for both compilation and linkage

49044950
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 5	
so it should be hu for unsigned short int


49046049
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	
math.h defines m_log2e to the value of log e if you define _use_math_defines before inclusion of math.h even though usual approach is to do log n log 2 i would advise to use multiplication instead as division is always slower especially for floats and more so on mobile cpus


49046049
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	0	
on mobile arm cpus i would expect floating point division to be somewhere 10-100 slower than multiplication


49048619

serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
don t initialize arrays lists that are serializable as their default value will be overwritten by deserialization leading to a wasted allocation


49074097
dplyr	sqldf	dplyr	tidyr	filtering	grouping	sqldf	tidyr
Pattern(s): 5	
as far as i know there is no such single function for this in dplyr but assuming that what you are referring to is this complex join shown in sql which for any row i computes the mean demand of those rows whose time points are between and library sqldf sqldf select a.time a.demand demand avg b.demand mean_demand from bod a join bod b on b.time between a.time - 2 and a.time grouping by a.time then this could be done in dplyr and tidyr like this although it does have the significant disadvantage that it forms the full n x n cross join and then filtering it down

49075593
octal	hex
Pattern(s): 5	
another option is using only printf but then you need octal numbers so using printf twice actually that last one can be done with hex as well just use instead of x and o reverts back to x

seaborn	matplotlib
Pattern(s): 7	
using seaborn is often fine for standard plots but when some customized requirements come into play falling back to matplotlib is often easier

width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
i have also tried layout fill it maintains aspect ratio but it creates padding if the given height width is larger than original image s height width


49108936
equals	tostring
Pattern(s): 2	
instead of trying to convert database values to desired culture - convert your input to the culture database expects if you will go this route - you might notice that there might actually be no need to convert number back to string because since you now know it s a number - you can compare it with equals and not tostring .contains ... like you are doing now


49109353
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
it is pretty much possible that the line with webelement.gettext would work but the line with webelement.click won t work as follows explaination the reason for this behavior is when the client the web browser returns back the control to the webdriver instance once document.readystate equals to complete is achieved it is quite possible that the intended webelement is present element is present but does not necessarily mean that the element is interactable and visible element is visible and also has a height and width that is greater than 0


49110986
portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 5	
i am pretty sure all is clear and should work as it is expected but for some reason when i use the app and lock the auto rotation and run the app it is automatically opening in portrait mode and when i unlock the autorotation it will be in landscape and you rotate it will be rotated to portrait mode

49112221
min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
your highest temperature will be stored in max and your lowest in min


49115797
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
even though this is labeled var and not let it will still be read-only because you have only specified a getter you could have specified a setter with a set block below the get block


49121455
toolbar	tabs	width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
detect if at max width you ll probably want to check if the document s width is lesser than the screen width you can t do this with height however as the browser has reserved vertical space for tabs and toolbar and there is no way of getting the height of those


49127837
webkit	blink
Pattern(s): 7	
works on webkit and blink browsers is a better solution because it doesn t break atbitrarily but only if necessary in case of one long string not separated by spaces that exceeds the allowed width limits


49128176
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
this type should be used for server-side applications. public public access type is for client-side clients that need to perform a browser login


49128459
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


49130446
int	chars	int	double	int	boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
string#trim is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace so the following work fine but if the user enters only whitespace that s fine too various representations of true false are used to determine boolean-ness ranges of byte short and float are used to box the value in the narrowest type available default type is string but if the equation is parsable by the javascript scriptengine if will be parsed and the result will be returned if the input string has length 1 and is not boolean or byte it will be assigned the chars type possible extensions might include putting a flag for the formula evaluation or a flag which would restrict returned types to common types boolean int double string


49131704
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 1	
that an import aspect data should be easily readable with getter setter just as a regular dataframe is


49139109

you can imagine the markup looks like so the above produces the results as expected in google-chrome even without using page specifically - seems like google-chrome is better with setting default margins whereas i am struggling to find a solution in safari


49139622
std	ostream
Pattern(s): 7	
the actual thing that does the writing in the iostreams api is std ostream it s also easier to remember to use and write rather than deal with the maze of cryptically named functinos that is the streambuf api


49139834
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
max roughly close and below to virt memory max min used roughly close to res memory don t quote me on this but virt mem is roughly close to or more than max memory allocated but as long as memory being used is free available in physical memory jvm does not throw memory exception


49141197
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
see that msdn sample first option is most convenient due automatic serializable deserialization 2nd one is more flexible as not all xml schemas can be achieved by serializable attributes


49142764
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
malloc must be matched with free and new must be matched with delete


49145348
int	chars
Pattern(s): 1	
if we take another example for int type first two pointer initializations work as int without any specifier is equivalent to signed int but this is not true with chars and therefore types are compatible


49148314
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 7	
however if the folder has more folder it includes them as well but i want to only include the files in the directory that was entered by the user


49150639

Pattern(s): 7	
visibility means that the elements are not only displayed but also have a height and width that is greater than 0


49157327
identityserver3	identityserver4
Pattern(s): 0	
since i m using an older client with identityserver4 in order to enable .net 4.x webapps to authenticate through identityserver4 cannot easily use .net core with those projects - luckily identityserver4 is still compatible with the older client code the action that triggers signout has two relevant things and you ll find a ton of examples of code for that will not work for you with mvc in .net 4.x use the signout method in this sample github repo the identityserver3 mvc owin sample client you can trigger that action from a button in a view


49158550
bower	npm
Pattern(s): 5	5	
as stated by pablo morra on a comment of the simplabs post using npm libraries in ember cli third party npm modules can be imported on ember.js from version 2.15 directly without the need of addons or wrappers unfortunately documentation is still on work and it doesn t say that npm modules can be imported only bower and vendor ones i ve gotten 2 solutions to import third party npm modules directly on ember.js from the ember cli documentation about managing dependencies although it s also out-of-date and says that npm modules can t be imported only bower and vendor ones npm module as standard anonymous amd asset amd asynchronous module definition i prefer and use this way because it avoids global variables and follows the import convention of ember.js


49160438
width	height

this can be cast to int float or double


49171175
exponent	modulo
Pattern(s): 7	
at the same time we need to substract that difference to the biased exponent and check for underflow or subnormal cases and renormalize the number left shift the mantissa and decrement exponent until the firs one in the mantissa goes to the hidden bit place note i assumed the biased exponent of the modulo is lower than the one of the number to be operated on as in the other case the mask is all ones and the number is not affected by the mask


49175192
for-loop	while-loop
Pattern(s): 7	
after the interpreter entered that line the first time it is inevitable that an indexerror occurs since length - 1 the upper limit of x in your for-loop now is larger than the last index of list1 two possible solutions capture the indexerror and break the for-loop then use a while-loop like this

ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
the instagram api mentions this the one thing to keep in mind is that all requests to the api must be made over ssl https not but then their example goes on to use an http callback registered redirect uri


49180135
minimum	max	disk	ram
Pattern(s): 5	
this is kind of funny considering the worry of 1000 bytes which is 1kb system ram is likely to be in gb s and because of disk file caching everything is likely to be loaded into ram anyway. but here s a way to run through the file and find what would be the maximum number of characters on what would be considered a line once you know the max length of a line you can either do one malloc knowing the minimum value you need.


49181027
cos	sin
Pattern(s): 5	
this is to avoid using the global attribute which implies poor data design update code credits to john coleman for spotting the problem in initial idea to use 1 sin a sin a +cos a cos a that would have been actually sin time+delta f sin time delta but it fails for 50 of a full period

firstly you shouldn t use border-radius of 50 that would make an oval when the width is larger than its height you should use a fixed value such as 30px


49222342
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 1	
first of all i d like to point out that hiding what powers your web app isn t really worth the time or effort with that said if you really really want to there are a couple of things you could try changing the defaults of apache tell all behaviour with these directives assuming you are using apache not really familiar with nginx servertokens prod serversignature off php will add a x-powered-by http header if expose_php was set to on in your php.ini file


49222357

Pattern(s): 7	0	
then consider the image to be portrait if the height is greater than the width


49224628
textview	imageview
Pattern(s): 7	
set this for your imageview do not use layout_editor_absolutey and layout_editor_absolutex at all because they don t compiled into your app they are in tools namespace you should change your xml like this if you have just two textview and one imageview at all put your constraintview in a scrollview but if you have lots of textview and imageview it is a better idea to use cardview

49310455
int	double
Pattern(s): 1	
this is exactly like the decision table above except the command is the one with an interface and subclasses - you don t need to do the switch because the command action subclass already has that logic for you for example if you need to make different decisions based on which command at multiple points int your code you might even want something as fancy as double dispatch which i won t go into here

openssl	libcrypto
Pattern(s): 5	
notes most likely newer openssl-fips versions will also have sha1 disabled since it s considered weak so the invariant should be switched to one of the sha2 hash functions family sha256 or even better sha3 older openssl versions might not have it from my pov this is a little too restrictive as there might be cases when a hashing algorithm is needed for purposes that don t care about security and more complex and also time consuming allowed algorithms still have to be used since openssl_fips env var is handled at openssl executable level which will be bypassed as libcrypto will be used directly it s no use for the current situation so we have to go deeper

here is a figure i tried to draw as a better explanation here is the function i have coded to do that then from a cube object attached to the camera not to the scene it can be rendered like that as a result this is what i got with a perspective camera and now it works with microsoft edge safari and other browsers despite when attaching to the scene and updating the position of the object to keep it in front of the camera it was only workable with firefox and google-chrome as for today

i have created a method that draws an octagon and it works well as long as the size is 200 or higher well my problem is that if the size is less than 200 or if width is different from height and vice versa the figure is deformed. my goal is to create a self-adapting figure that retains its shape when the width and height is less than 200 or that width is different from height this is what happens if for example i set the size to 50x50

spannable	spanned
Pattern(s): 5	5	
3.spannablestringbuilder works in a little complex manner.we can append text to a spannablestringbuilder with one of the append methods.some part of the text a spannablestringbuilder holds can be marked as spanned and only that part gets styled with color font etc. when a new text is appended within a spannablestringbuilder object at any index if the new text will also be marked as spaned or not that is defined by the fields of the spanned interface. we call the setspan object what int start int end int flags method declared by the spannable interface and implemented by the spannablestringbuilder class. here what is a object of a class of the android.text.style.stylespan package this object defines the type of the styling we want to apply flags is one of the field defined in the spanned interface this flags parameter specifies when a new text is appended within this spannablestringbuilder object at any index if the new text will also be marked as spanned or not

49494540
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	0	
to ensure this the compiler uses the following rules if an operand is an int that is narrower than an int it undergoes integral promotion as described above to int or unsigned int. if the operands still do not match then the compiler finds the highest priority operand and implicitly converts the other operand to match. the priority of operands is as follows long double highest double float unsigned long long long long unsigned long long unsigned int int lowest in your case on of operands has type int and another one type size_t so max was promoted to type size_t and bit representation of -1 is the biggest possible size_t


49494767

i would ve expected the branch to merge with master after squash intermediate commits in the squash and merge operation as well


49498753
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type

Pattern(s): 5	
a short example would be note since strtok modifies the original string and advances the pointer it uses you must make a copy of the friends token and preserve a pointer to the starting address of the allocated token for friends pf so that it can be free after you are done with separating friends also note if your system provides strdup you can replace the two calloc strlen p + 1 1 and strcpy pf p

width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
in practice this warning can show for cases like if using ui form editor and you manually drag a widget such that resulting geometry can t fit in screen at run time or more generally when a widget geometry is smaller than the layout contents it isn t a serious issue because the widget will automatically adjust and render correctly but this issue can be solved by insuring the widget gets enough space before rendered this is done by adjusting its size to contents thus try on the other hand while the issue is not reproducible to me with but it only appeared at 200 200 100 100 it could be your geometry width height is smaller than your chart view dimensions try to adjust them to higher geometry width height to accommodate your chart

public	protected
Pattern(s): 5	
you want just this instead securitycodesended.addrange securitycodepresend.take 15 and now for some pedantry i note that your code should conform to the c# .net naming conventions method parameters and in this case local variables should be camelcase public and protected instance members should be pascalcase static fields should in my opinion be prefixed with an underscore _ instance members should always be prefixed with this

49872594
fgets	strtol	fgets	atoi	strtol	atoi
Pattern(s): 7	
the best way to convert that string 4 to 4 is to use strtol with examples here but atoi is slightly easier as an example that does semantically what your code does but is safer and compiles note the #define this is a preprocessor macro that helps keep the 60 common between the buffer size and the length passed to fgets

multiplying	multiplication	primes	palindrome
Pattern(s): 7	0	
for each primes if you multiplying it by the other primes in a descending order the first palindrome you find will be the highest possible for that primes so its not necessary to iterate the rest if the multiplication is lower than highest palindrome found checking if it is palindrome is not necessary not sure how many of these tips you can apply to your code in a functional way but here is a javascript non functional approach that makes full use of these ideas and takes less than 1 second additional tip it could be further optimized by calculating with binary search the first prime2 that will cause prime1 to have 9 digits instead of 10 that way skipping a lot of iterations over primes2


50008262
free	malloc

Pattern(s): 5	
as it is stated with the polling methode cpu must work non-stop which is really dumb because instead of working continously for an internal peripheral it could just easily do some other job like waiting for tcp reception or something that can t be done via irq or simply go to low-power mode and wait for the irq to kick in

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays	put	get
Pattern(s): 2	
reason - you are counting arrays length inside loops and every time when any value got unset from the arrays length of arrays decreased and value of changed simply decreased so logically your 5th and 6th element never goes through if condition they never get traversed by loops because of decreasing length of the arrays solution 1 - put count outside and it will work properly - output - solution 2 - that s why i prefer foreach over for-loop output -

there are several ways to do that. we find that 3 is the only primes that divides more than one modulus and the highest power of that primes that divides more than one modulus is i use the notation for exponentiation used in python and fortran for clarity since the caret also has other uses in computers. that could prevent your system of equations from having any solution at all


50081813
primes	modulus
Pattern(s): 0	
if a higher power of 3 also divided more than one modulus we would need to check those higher powers as well. for each primes that we discovered and each modulus we find the highest power of that primes that divides the modulus


50081813
primes	modulus
Pattern(s): 7	0	
we also add the new equations we get for each power of the primes that divides more than one modulus


50082556
min	max
Pattern(s): 8	
at least in this case the order by...limit may be more efficient than min max even when an index can be used


50082665
std	ostream
Pattern(s): 5	
my print line is in c++ if you want to print something you can simply std cout it given the things that you want to print have overloaded for ostream -- no need to construct a string object first and since getstatus returns a status you should make sure the status class has overloaded for the ostream


50082991
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
i understand that post is more secure than get get makes the data visible in the http url however couldn t we just use post for everything then


50084895
prop	each
Pattern(s): 5	
for this purpose you can make use of the onquerychange prop on reactivelist first specify an onquerychange prop on the reactivelist which receives the previous and current query as parameters this function will be invoked each time the query is changed so you can write a logic to fetch the hits for the current query received in the next parameter whenever required


50086857
alexa	amazon
Pattern(s): 8	
i use the inline editor all amazon pages web site etc etc etc on my windows 10 machine. i have used the raspbian machine like a unix machine only for certs process and for the aws-iot-device-sdk and for zip the file to be send to the lambda aws console. all works perfectly. now i have seen that if i need to be more interactive with alexa i must use the alexa-sdk


50087090
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
authenticationfilter authenticationprovider springbootexampleapplication when running this locally and sending a request to a endpoint that is supposed to be authenticated the try-catch in the callback-onsuccess in the filter throws the following exception-handling i ve tried researching this error online but have not found anything


50092878
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
int cannot to be converted to double implicitly but double to double is ok


50094031
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
using a for-loop is faster than a foreach in .net which loops runs faster #39


50097723
integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 7	
the decimal value needs to round up to the nearest integer it doesn t matter if the fractions part is greater or less than .5


50099616
octal	decimal
Pattern(s): 5	
your will be considered as octal base but is an decimal base


50101584
floating-point	integer
Pattern(s): 10	8	
floating-point arithmetic is often more expensive than integer arithmetic in terms of processor cycles and or the space required for it in the silicon of processors and or the energy required for it


50104632
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
since loops index is more or less useless we can use the enhanced for-loop construct to loops over the words in the arrays if you have not learned the enhanced for-loop you can stick with but understand you will not use the value i at any other point inside loops


50104730
direct3d	directx
Pattern(s): 7	
more resources on the retired legacy directx sdk directx sdk tools catalog directx sdk samples catalog directx sdks of a certain age and the zombie directx sdk more resources for learning direct3d11 getting started with direct3d 11 and directx tool kit for dx11 note you should also consider moving to vs 2017 instead of sticking with a 12+ year old toolset


50108939
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
but an ascending index can help to quickly partition the set of records into those records that have a lower value than the minimum of the range and those that have a higher value than it


50108939
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	0	
that is the number of due dates that are greater than the range s maximum is far smaller than the number of them being less than its minimum


50108939
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
in other words taking the partition of those invoices with a due date greater than the minimum of the range which we can get quickly from the index and filtering out the few where the due date is greater than the maximum isn t a too bad approach


50109166
onclick	preventdefault
Pattern(s): 5	
try to use event.preventdefault method to not trigger link default onclick event. more information can be found here preventdefault

already tried java version 8 and gradlew update . gradlew build.gradle support for running gradlew using java 7 has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in gradlew 5.0


50113786
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 7	7	
boost python is a richer library with size cost where as pybind11 is header only and it supports stl which makes life easier to pass on basic data structure without writing any code


50117829
masm	irvine32
Pattern(s): 5	
although you might be stuck with masm for irvine32


50118215
typeerror	traceback
Pattern(s): 5	
you need to return the inner function wrap in valid_user while it is perfectly valid to not return anything from an outer decorator function bear in mind that the wrapped function is passed to the wrapper at run time thus the returned value will be none traceback most recent call last file line 1 in typeerror nonetype object is not callable


50120984
cos	sin
Pattern(s): 5	
the point will be defined by cos and sin of the angle

i downloaded all required files from here and here starting with package aapt of course dpkg will tell you dependencies some can be installed via apt thanks to these sites


50125387
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
rather than start from scratch with a whole new implementation it seems there s a way to extend kinwebbrowser but i m not totally familiar with swift syntax yet or objective-c and it seems that kinwebbrowser is written in objective-c


50125892
super	implements
Pattern(s): 5	
mov mem1 mem2 - copy the contents of memory location mem1 to memory location mem2 leaving mem1 unchanged nand mem1 mem2 to mem3- perform a bitwise logical nand between the data at mem1 and mem2 and write the result to mem3 bitshiftr mem1 mem2 mem3- bitshift right the data at mem1 mem2 places and write the output to mem3 jmpcond mem1 mem2 - test the least significant bit at mem1 and if it is true 1 jump to mem2 now it won t be super fast and it will eat memory bandwidth like crazy but it can be used to implements a virtual machine with any arbitrary instruction set


50126205
outputstream	inputstream
Pattern(s): 5	
connection bluetoothdevice.createrfcommsockettoservicerecord uuid creates a socket from which data can be go through inputstream and outputstream


50133362
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 1	
i explored hash based algorithms such as md5 and bcrypt


50136734
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
so all of these are valid binary max heaps of 4 items 4 4 4 2 3 3 2 3 1 1 1 2 the key here is that in each case the largest value is at the root and children are always smaller than their parent


50140637
shim	polyfills
Pattern(s): 10	
polyfills is a more specialized type of shim that is used to provide forward compatibility in different browser level specifications


50143862
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
although loading the entire arrays may seem wasteful it is much faster than parsing the file line-by-line provided you have enough memory to do so. it turns out -- thanks to hpaulj for motivating me to test -- that a simple for-loop is much faster for example with this setup we can use ipython to benchmark the speed of using_genfromtxt vs using_readline so a simple for-loop is actually 10x faster


50146080
jobs	cron
Pattern(s): 5	
all the examples appeared to be geared towards cron jobs running every seconds 3


50150552

50151182
leaflet	openlayers
Pattern(s): 10	
i m trying to use openlayers with angular 5. i m testing different ways to implement maps i ve already tested leaflet and openlayers in simple html files and i ve choosed to use openlayers which is more efficient in my case


50152075
strncmp	strcmp
Pattern(s): 5	0	
i have 2 strings to compare and i thought using strncmp would be better than using strcmp because i know one of the strings length


50153780
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
you cannot override an extension member without exposing it to the objective-c runtime because extension members cannot currently be added to swift class vtables as swift vtables currently cannot have members dynamically added to them at runtime


50159359
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0


50161670
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
the data of both fragment are dynamically changed from server.here i have to click a textview of fragment b then its linearlayout s color be changed manually post method but due to net slow the background color of fragment a because the textview of fragment a is already selected so its color is already set. is not removed from linearlayout get method


50162640
flask	django
Pattern(s): 8	
you could put your button in a form with a hidden input and access the value with request.form.get hsname or request.post.get hsname depending on how flask implements this i m more familiar with django


50162657
coalesce	isnull
Pattern(s): 10	
if all names match if they don t then use isnull or coalesce but isnull is more efficient


50162673
hex	binary
Pattern(s): 1	
just have in mind that the best result is with negative hex and binary integer interpretations simple numbers not so much also with hex you can set up the byte size


50162907
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 1	
this unfortunately counted punctuation as words characters so hello world


50164901
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
i am setting the main window height like this i can see that the width is all fine however the height is actually smaller for some reason 680px instead of the specified 702


50166596
build.gradle	gradlew
Pattern(s): 7	
once i did i get this gradlew error more than one variant of project mymodule matches the consumer attributes - configuration mymodule debugapielements variant android-aidl - found artifacttype android-aidl but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.api.attributes.buildtypeattr debug and found compatible value debug . - found com.android.build.api.attributes.variantattr debug but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.gradle.internal.dependency.androidtypeattr aar and found compatible value aar . - required org.gradle.usage java-api and found compatible value java-api . - configuration mymodule debugapielements variant android-classes - found artifacttype android-classes but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.api.attributes.buildtypeattr debug and found compatible value debug . - found com.android.build.api.attributes.variantattr debug but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.gradle.internal.dependency.androidtypeattr aar and found compatible value aar . - required org.gradle.usage java-api and found compatible value java-api . - configuration mymodule debugapielements variant android-manifest - found artifacttype android-manifest but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.api.attributes.buildtypeattr debug and found compatible value debug . - found com.android.build.api.attributes.variantattr debug but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.gradle.internal.dependency.androidtypeattr aar and found compatible value aar . - required org.gradle.usage java-api and found compatible value java-api . - configuration mymodule debugapielements variant android-renderscript - found artifacttype android-renderscript but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.api.attributes.buildtypeattr debug and found compatible value debug . - found com.android.build.api.attributes.variantattr debug but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.gradle.internal.dependency.androidtypeattr aar and found compatible value aar . - required org.gradle.usage java-api and found compatible value java-api . - configuration mymodule debugapielements variant jar - found artifacttype jar but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.api.attributes.buildtypeattr debug and found compatible value debug . - found com.android.build.api.attributes.variantattr debug but wasn t required. - required com.android.build.gradle.internal.dependency.androidtypeattr aar and found compatible value aar . - required org.gradle.usage java-api and found compatible value java-api . here is the project s build.gradle


50167540
memset	calloc
Pattern(s): 3	
going back to the initalization though this is how you would set every element in a stack-allocated array on declaration if you dynamically allocate the array i recommend using calloc or memset to set the array elements to a default value for the same reason


50168808
zoo	xts
Pattern(s): 5	
to.daily can only be applied to xts zoo objects and can only convert to a lower frequency


50170257
equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 1	
note that the fact that your compareto is not consistent with equals may create other issues so only do this if you understand what you are doing


50170528
lan	localhost
Pattern(s): 5	
to allow connections from your lan you need to edit the following edit my.conf and find the bind-address parameter in the mysqld section this will probably be set to localhost or 127.0.0.1 you can either change this to the ip of the machine you want to connect to the database or use a wildcard and allow your whole local range e.g 192.168.0


50170952
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 5	
we have several azure search indexes that use a cosmos db collection of 25k documents as a source and each index has a large number of document properties that can be used for sorting and filtering


50172439
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 3	
the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself


50173318
minimum	max
Pattern(s): 5	
if i use only the minimum number of elements will be validated max has no effect


50173676
ng-switch	ng-show
Pattern(s): 5	
actually this can be done by ng-show or ng-if or ng-switch but if you want a clean html template view and your arrays structures are the same you may want to migrate the logic to controller like and do the logic of using which array in your controller


50173981
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i think nginx is much better than apache


50176807
put	get
Pattern(s): 10	10	
when one says that hashmap get put is o 1 it should really say that the time needed for the get put is more or less constant and does not depend on the number of elements in the hashmap so far as the hashmap can be presented on the actual computing system


50178207
fgetc	fread
Pattern(s): 5	
it looks like you might have thought that fgetc tested to see if there was another byte available and that fread then read it


50179368
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
so most likely you ll need to set the width with 2px lower than the height


50182623
lan	localhost
Pattern(s): 5	
im new to setting up apache - the site works fine on localhost but when i access it from the lan it does now display the index.html file - instead the browser says this site can t be reached localhost refused to connect


50183293
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0


50185665
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 5	
and these city specification be combined together using previously defined logical specifications so our combined specificaton would look like this following that filtering would be easy we just need to pass the specification a parameter criterion object from original question could be expressed as a specification yet we are flexible to adjust business rules in any way we want here maxfemalepopulation and minfemalepopulation need to be defined often specification uses builder pattern that allows building of the specification using fluent interfaces sorting can be done after filtering because there will be less items to sort collections.sort filtering


50186574
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
html css if you need to fix the dimensions of the parent so that the element does not define the size of the window you could do something like so with your css in this case your width will ideally be 400px wide but never exceed the viewport width and never be more that 400px high but never exceed the viewport height. if you want to get even cleverer with your height you could use calc for you max height so the that window never exceeds a specific height taking into consideration other elements on the page


50187611
http	spdy
Pattern(s): 5	
perhaps chrome used to call it quic rather than http 2 + quic but it would always have been using http 2 or its similar predecessor spdy


50190091
jruby	mri
Pattern(s): 0	
however this turns out not to be the case i ve tried many combinations of jruby jvm options but the steady state is 2x slower than mri


50191928
a-star	dijkstra
Pattern(s): 0	
i have a nasty bug that i can t solve for quite some time. i have implemented maze solving using a a-star and dijkstra in python and my a is actually slower than dijkstra


50193699
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
your navbar component is the first one to be called the parent component so to speak building up before the children are initialized


50194070
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
i don t understand the following sequence where a virtual environment in my mac os ends up with a versioning of pip that s older than the versioning it created it we ve made sure the interpreter is 2.7.15 this is just a check that the interpreter is 2.7.15 and now we generate the requirements output which is small as expected but which gives this warning which is what i don t understand we ll now leave the environment and do freeze outside it no suggestion for upgrade is given here despite the fact that we have the same versioning of python if i understand correctly as we check next why did it install a different versioning of pip


50194566
3dsmax	blender	maya	blender	maya	3dsmax
Pattern(s): 10	
if you re a student you can get free licence for maya 3dsmax and zbrush. maya 3dsmax and blender is more convenient for tech objects like robots cars etc. zbrush is more convenient for organic objects


50195359
chown	chmod
Pattern(s): 5	5	
permissions can be changed with chmod ownership can be changed with chown


50195503
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
first off this while loops should be made a for-loop like so this is simply because it is more stylistically appropriate


50196121
laravel	codeigniter
Pattern(s): 10	
side note you could research the orm approach to models laravel and a host of other frameworks use it but codeigniter has a more whatever approach to just about everything


50196167
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 1	
nano etc postgresql 9.x main pg_hba.conf change peer in this line local all postgres peer to local all postgres trust restart the server sudo service postgresql restart login into psql and set your passwd psql -u postgres alter user postgres with passwd your-pass


50201750
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
when an image is scaled it is done with respect to the top left so it will always look up if the height is smaller than the prefix or to the right if the width is smaller


50206803
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 7	
keras is a higher level library that is much easier to learn than tensorflow and you have more sample code online


50210666
cpu	affinity
Pattern(s): 10	
cpu is multicore user-space app will have affinity to one core


50211053
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
so instead of using double and allowing for invalid inputs you should be using long instead which has a greater range than int


50211566
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 10	
it was simply just gain super user privilege and then enable and start rsync process sudo su enter your passwd then digit systemctl enable rsync systemctl start rsync if you don t have a systemctl based terminal just use service instead


50212366
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
the two are often useful for when you want to seperate those two ways of looking at a vector for example if you need to have an influcence between two bodies where the influence is inversly proportional to the distance between them you can do this is the most typical use case for me i am not sure what the author of the original code meant by his as it does seem he could just use a vector difference without using the two extra calls mathf.clamp returns value of value lies between min and max returns min if its lower and max if is greater


50217852
vsts	tfs
Pattern(s): 7	0	
vsts is better than tfs because is 100 online


50219982
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
i have an image thats a particular height and width and its designed in such a way where its content is meant to be displayed at a minimum height and as the height increases more of the image is allowed to be seen meant to clip at the frame


50220375
do.call	lapply
Pattern(s): 0	
i don t think this is really what you meant by using dplyr or that this is better than a do.call rbind lapply ... approach but you could define a function like you ve described above then use your piping to group_by region to apply the function to each group definitely would need a number check though it does seem to match your output for the 500 group at least


50222787
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
the site loads more post as i get to the bottom


50225201
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
as comment said this should be handled server-side but if you had no option other than to implement it client-side it s possible that said it s generally a good idea to use async or defer regardless so as to avoid blocking document parsing while the script is executing


50226045
post	get
Pattern(s): 7	
you can use get post method or session cookie for passing data from one page to another page example get and post php code change the method for the form to post if you want to do it via post. both are equally insecure although get is easier to hack. get method can handle less amount of data. for handling higher amount of data use post methode and also check the post_max_size in php.ini file


50236121
margin	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
just add jobtitledetailedlabel height constrain to be greaterthanorequaltoconstant profileimageview height + 10 for margin because if jobtitledetailedlabel height is less than image height it will make it small cell row


50236235
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
so the width will never cover the screen because it s smaller than height


50237263
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
i am trying to map a string of chars a t c g into a 64 bit int where each letter is represented as two bits using this mapping the sequence string will not be longer than 28 chars and i intend for the int to be zero-padded at the beginning to make it 64 bits


50238123
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 5	
i think it should be used a delimiter for array of string such as a comma character beside that there is no trimming spaces for example entityarchivedevent


50238785
vtk	paraview
Pattern(s): 1	
i have vtk files from a numerical simulation that i usually visualize with paraview


50241289
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 2	
the type of your button is a submit so when you click on it is triggering the onsubmit event which is not existing in your case so you ll have to choose between submission your form or using a click event on a normal button below is a clear example on how the two approaches work approach 1 using a form submission approach 2 using a simple click event


50247626
coalesce	nvl
Pattern(s): 5	
it s worth noting that nvl is a binary function meaning only one column value can be tested however coalesce can test multiple columns values at the same time like below select coalesce column1 column2 column3 null from your_table


50247861
min	max
Pattern(s): 2	
you want to compare min with max not and that condition have two part then the code would be from what i am seeing bainarysearch


50251407
gridbaglayout	miglayout
Pattern(s): 5	
sampling your layout using pure borderlayout and gridlayout and the fully resizable output the same can be achieved using gridbaglayout which is similar to miglayout in the way of thinking about the layout and positioning and spanning components over grid cells


50255886
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
if i d use the interface client-side only i could use a response proxy like this however i can t properly use this interface for the server-side implementation since responseobject is to be used client-side only with an interface for automatic mapping from generic http-responses not as a return type on the server side


50257720
accessor	properties
Pattern(s): 5	
now the mentioned misconception is caused by the fact that vast majority of tutorials together with stock visual studio code snippets instruct you to use clr properties for regular dependency properties and get set accessor for attached ones


50259620
min	max
Pattern(s): 8	
i would think exists if you just want the entity attribute values with pairs use group by note that you could use but count distinct incurs more overhead than min and max


50265298
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 8	
innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb. index y_id x_id -- the primary key makes it efficient to go one direction


50267624
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
from out of nowhere when the link should be processed i get an exception if i put a breakpoint and use debug mode however the first link is processed properly but i get the same error when the 2nd should be processed


50269413
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 5	
from the server side on linux server you can set up the required header in web server configuration for source domain example.com in plesk go to and add the following directives in additional directives for http and additional directives for https alternatively in this case .htaccess file with the following content can be used if nginx is enabled and static content needed to be displayed use the following directive in additional nginx directives field without apache directives


50272354
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
you can just set up your edittext with font needed then call then you will get required width and height from bounds


50274228
express	node.js
Pattern(s): 1	
i have read that express 4.x is not compatible with node.js native http2 from 8.4+ and i was hoping for more progess on express 5.x than it has. but as i started thinking that express5.x will probably be released to late for my next node.js project - i came over nest.js


50276921
post	get
Pattern(s): 2	
but in honesty for rpc remote procedure calls people choose between get and post by either get for operations that don t modify anything and post for other cases


50278224
range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
when a new task is added to a queue i want to run it if the number of ongoing tasks is less than max the reason i can t use atomicinteger or longaddr is that they only allow you to compare against a specific value instead of a range of values


50279978
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
you ended up in this loops because it was a bad idea in the first place to use a while loops to process the arguments should have used a for-loop for arg


50282578
mergesort	insertion-sort
Pattern(s): 5	
since insertion-sort will break it s loops after making only n comparison and the other half will be sorted by mergesort in nlogn and you get upper-bound as nlogn


50282968
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 0	
mail.domain.com-le-ssl.conf generated by let s encrypt my apache2 virtual host config for reverse proxy mail.example.com.conf please note that my original apache2 config file is because i don t really need ssl encryption between apache and nginx the rewrite rule was added when i installed let s encrypt certificate on apache mail server for mail.example.com

50284375
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
example the data frame looks like i tried and it returns an error valueerror arrays were different lengths 2 vs 3 i wonder if there is any better solution than using for-loop to iterate the dataframe

google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
the easiest way i found to import url links list from excel or txt text document to google-chrome is open firefox no this is not a joke highlight all the cells with url inside in excel click hold on the selected cells and move to bookmark zone from firefox and release the click firefox understand what he needs to do and makes bookmarks open google-chrome three dots on top left bookmarks import bookmarks import from firefox firefox devs made this better than google-chrome clap clap

elasticsearch	kibana
Pattern(s): 5	
i have a documents in elasticsearch with the following structure i want to write some queries that allow me to count the aggregated documents for variablepart. also i would like to make sure that the result of my queries can be viewed with kibana but i do not know where to start


50295381
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
non-final variables should almost always be used with getter and setter


50295977
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
if the number is already a string one could take advantage of the fact that a string can be treated as a chars array and chars can be converted to int implicitly this can handle arbitrarily large strings as long as the total doesn t exceed int.maxvalue eg unless the number is already in string form though this isn t efficient nor does it verify that the contents are an actual number


50296908
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
all of this bodged together as it might be works in google-chrome and firefox on the networks i am constrained to using but does not do a thing in internt explorer


50297356
post	put	content-length	content-type
Pattern(s): 5	
if you want to send data of xml you can do this in both put and post it does not have to be determined content-length but you must add content-type


50298207
chunked	transfer-encoding
Pattern(s): 1	
that s only possible with chunked transfer-encoding or with content-length


50299918
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	5	
width and width multiplied by x should be classified as width key w height and height multiplied by x should be classified as height key h and so on

width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
Pattern(s): 7	
your textarea width is greater the the container 100 + 2px of border + 2px left padding + 2px right padding so used box-sizing border-box


50308777
filewriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 0	
maybe contrary to its name filewriter is also buffered though it has smaller buffer than bufferedwriter so contents are not written to disk immediately


50316247
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
in other words instead of throwing a runtimeexception your compiler converts the int that takes less size to the type that takes more size which is in your case a double


50319496
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 0	
debian 9 stable at the moment uses and older version than ubuntu 18.04 stable at the moment and debian unstable


50320618
minimum	max
Pattern(s): 0	
as such all you d need is a simple call to std max to determine the bigger value of two inputs when using the new size it will basically resize the window to match your object unless the object is smaller than your minimum size


50321636
public	protected
Pattern(s): 3	
i recommend adding protected setters to the parent class or make them public if you have external classes setting these values


50323533
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 5	
as a rule of thumb you should use the prototype scope for all beans that are stateful while the singleton scope should be used for stateless beans


50323550
elasticsearch	kibana
Pattern(s): 7	
running different major version releases of kibana and elasticsearch kibana 5.x and elasticsearch 2.x is not supported nor is running a minor version of kibana that is newer than the version of elasticsearch kibana 5.1 and elasticsearch 5.0


50323550
elasticsearch	kibana	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	0	0	
however in order to facilitate an upgrade process where elasticsearch is upgrade first you can run a minor versioning of elasticsearch that is higher than kibana kibana 5.0 and elasticsearch 5.1


50323674
elasticsearch	fluentd
Pattern(s): 5	
how can i use the logs generated by python code to be used by fluentd and publish it to elasticsearch


50323936
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 7	
thus in your code you would use the functionality or role names you whish but behind the scenes everything would be translated in ad grouping membership. i have written an authorization filtering that handles latter scenario and i am happily sharing it with you if you need it - you have tagged your question with asp.net-mvc


50325044
vsts	tfs
Pattern(s): 5	
your requirement can be achieved in tfs vsts easily

Pattern(s): 5	
the conditional operator can only be used with scalar arithmetic or pointer operands


50327136
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 7	8	
it s very easy to spend a lot of time making a reliable layer on top of udp that is both slower and less reliable than tcp


50328522
eigen	lapack
Pattern(s): 5	
however mkl will be used whenever eigen falls back to blas lapack methods


50329024
mapbox	maptiler
Pattern(s): 1	
access_token access_token maptiler tilehosting tiles in pbf format - zoom max 14 pbf format is basically same as mapbox mvt same parsers might be used to get tile just use link z x y .pbf


50329700
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	0	
in the example above it always uses 17.5 width for the menu because if max is smaller than min then max is ignored and the function is treated as min. source what i want is a menu that is 17.5 width with a max of 250px


50330999
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you can t use grid-template-columns because the minmax function computes to min anytime max is less than min


50333529
decimal	ieee
Pattern(s): 0	
note using parsefloat ieee 754 double precision floating-point means you have a maximum of 52 bits of precision which is a bit more than 15 decimal places

50338957
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the video will be 100 height of the container and centered horizontally note i chose not to write a conditional to check if the video height is greater than the width because it seems like it d be a fringe case


50339001
post	get
Pattern(s): 8	
as far as i can tell get requests are supposed to be safer not less safe than post requests because get only retrieves data while post sends data to the server


50344778
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
it should then notice that the min max difference is still greater than 0.2 and start all over again


50344778
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
below should be the first group of 11 from the above sample after the code is done 178 179 1.0 0.00277 170.3 82 83 1.0 0.00145 170.3 574 575 1.0 0.00162 170.3 97 98 1.0 0.00190 170.3 399 400 1.0 0.00172 170.4 21 22 1.0 0.00166 170.4 67 68 1.0 0.00176 170.5 103 104 1.0 0.00154 170.5 553 554 1.0 0.00169 170.5 533 534 1.0 0.00167 170.5 177 178 1.0 0.00160 170.5 and here is the result of my code as it currently stands group 0 was bad. 643 4 group 0 was bad. 642 4 group 0 was bad. 641 4 group 0 was bad. 640 4 group 0 was bad. 639 4 group 0 is good. 638 4 group 1 was bad. 638 4 group 0 is good. 637 4 group 1 was bad. 637 4 group 0 is good. 636 4 group 1 was bad. 636 4 group 0 is good. 635 4 group 1 was bad. 635 4 group 0 is good. 634 4 group 1 was bad. 634 4 group 0 is good. 633 4 group 1 is good. 633 4 634 4 635 4 636 4 637 4 638 4 639 4 group 1 is good. 639 4 640 4 group 1 is good. 640 4 641 4 group 1 is good. 641 4 642 4 group 1 is good. 642 4 643 4 group 1 is good. 643 4 643 4 notice how it keeps removing rows when it reads that group 0 has a difference between max and min that is greater than 0.2

hid	keyboard
Pattern(s): 5	
the keyboard can be shown and hid over and over and nothing is ever fired


50352165
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
i also notice that the fields inside the no param constructor can be changed using getter and setter methods so i do not see differences with a constructor that has parameters


50352806
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
even if the element has a greater width than height or the other way around it will still become a circle and not an oval


50354836
build.gradle	gradlew
Pattern(s): 5	
you can create npm and yarn task wrappers and npm is not required to be installed gradlew and dependency management takes care of that node plugin documentation execute npm tasks so just gradlew --init in the reactjs project s root folder then add the plugin and npm tasks to your new build.gradle file


50355520
vsts	tfs
Pattern(s): 5	
if you re trying to clone a regular git repo that happens to be hosted in tfs vsts you can just use regular git clone


50362929
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
notice that c is such a low-level language that coding conventions are really important in particular when you deal with pointers to heap allocated - malloc -ed or calloc -ed- data you should define and document some convention explaining who and how these pointers should be free -d and what is the size of the pointed data


50365490
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
parent will be sorted above children because their parentid is -1


50366526
mousemove	mouseleave

the reason this happens is because the mouseleave the helper plane between two mousemove events


50368006
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
for it to be adapted to int double or similar


50373474
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 5	
this is sort of a wild guess but i think the problem is here you just split the text which means that some stop words might still be glued to punctuation and thus are not filtered in the next step


50377116
int	chars
Pattern(s): 10	
here a a few issues to address the arrays do not need to have int type chars type is a more appropriate choice


50378209
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
while the third is doing something similar to the second but is saving that until runtime which is my guess as to why still a property call within a new inline method which i would have expected to get put out into its own compiler created method similar to the second version so i m guessing that part is going to happen at compile time which would explain why it s time is so ridiculously higher than the first two


50380578
free	calloc
Pattern(s): 10	
sometimes calloc is more preferable call in c as it protects on some platforms against overflow and remember to free


50383678
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
you need to give fixed width and height to the table cells so that it won t be distorted on time of adding images


50384078
multiplying	subtract
Pattern(s): 0	
multiplying all odd positions indexes 1 3 5 etc. of input by 2. if any of these multiplied entries is greater than 9 subtract 9


50387219
prepare	execute
Pattern(s): 5	
not being viable for your case is because those parameterized queries are implemented using prepare statements a statement is sent to database parsed compiled and possibly optimized without the values being known at this time primary use case intended for prepare statements is performance improvements through reuse of the compiled statement the values are then provided in second step instructing the database to perform the statement with those values another set of values then may be sent to execute the prepare statement with etc

so the common idiom for tasks like this is which would work even if folder were a complete path and more than one directory along the path needed to be added


50398305
ienumerable	iqueryable
Pattern(s): 7	0	
but if the ienumerable is much larger than the iqueryable just filter the iqueryable as much as possible on the database side and then use asenumerable to pull it into memory and join there


50398398
filehandler	logfile
Pattern(s): 10	
problem if i use logging.basicconfig filename logfile there is no more terminal output from logging module. if i add another filehandler for the logfile this is only used by main module and not by sub modules example using python 2.7 update just found but example is not working no output on terminal or file info for newer python version . since python 3.3 logging.basicconfig can take a keyword argument handlers


50399901
plot	heatmap
Pattern(s): 0	
you also need to scale flip the images so they plot together because the map is probably much finer resolution than the heatmap


50400207
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
this answer has nothing to do with why your uiscrollview doesnt work. uiscrollview will only scroll if its content size is greater than its frame size. you should first decide the size of your uiscrollview frame than for a veritical uiscrollview you should assign the content size as follow lets say you have 5 uiview s which have height of 5 dp each than you should set the uiscrollview height like so scrollview.setcontentsize width 5 5 . than if the uiscrollview frame height is greater than 25 the uiscrollview will not scroll

Pattern(s): 5	
here is the code in swift which can easily be converted to objective-c


50406279
int	chars	16-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 1	
what is required by standard chars is the smallest memory unit and has at least 8 bits - all other types have a size that is a multiple of the size of chars short has at least 16-bit int is at least as large as short and has at least 16-bit long is at least as large as int and has as least 32 bits long long is at least as large as long and has as least 64bit but for example you cannot know what is the most appropriate type to process 32 bits values


50410744
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
so what this says is that provided your subclassing doesn t have any more values than the superclass used to determine ordering implementing is reasonable


50415959
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 5	
as a rule of thumb you should use the prototype scope for all beans that are stateful while the singleton scope should be used for stateless beans


50418038
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 0	
the problem i m having with this code is that it will mark sentences shorter than 25 words if you include commas in the sentence - this might also happen with other punctuation marks but so far i ve experienced it with commas specifically


50419731
flutter	dart-sdk

the second column is minlat is tested with a range so the rest of the columns won t be used for filtering or sorting


50423386
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
while doing so i found there s a script on the page which is near identical to what you would get with the request i simply stripped the portion of the script as well as the trailing semi-colon parsed that like you would with the request and used the data the same way - the actual post data is slightly more deeply nested but it s all there

in order to resolve this issue you will need to put your node.js server live with ssl certificate or secure https


50424373
printf	strncpy
Pattern(s): 5	
and finally you can fit 3 characters into by using strncpy but the buffer cannot fit the terminating null character and therefore it cannot be printed using printf s but you can print it with specifying explicit field width that is less than or equal to the length of the array - however the printed out value would be padded and compiling running it but there is one extra space character printed after ab


50424378
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
in most cases firefox runs blazor apps much faster than google-chrome or edge which implies that browser makers still need to improve even firefox can improve

error-handling	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
2 next given there are no details about the client-side part of the mcve i may have got the scenario idea incorectly so bear with me - there are only these compatible zeromq scalable formal communication archetype sockets matches available ever since up to api v4.2.x in 2018 q2 3 there is a good engineering practice not to let unhandled exception-handling happen the more if context -instance may still bear the possession of ip port# b locked resource sometimes even beyond the python process termination many incidents with my own naive and this way deadlocked experiments in my past dark history o each step in the infrastructure setup ought be wrapped into error-handling syntax-clause best including a finally section where so far created resources will occasionally get dismantled in a graceful manner in cases when exception-handling s spring out

ethernet	wireless
Pattern(s): 0	
i have more than ten ethernet ports no wireless etc


50430191
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
the other approach is that you don t actually give the value back until all children have updated times greater than their parent or whatever inputs are in your function. if you do an insert then the child nodes won t exist until they re processed but you ll have to handle the case where you query a node that doesn t exist due to a rebuild versus the case where you query a node that just doesn t exist


50430925
qcombobox	qtreeview
Pattern(s): 5	
if you analyze your logic you can see that the data has the structure of a tree root measurements set 1 p1-p2 p3-p4 measurements set 2 p5-p6 p7-p8 so it will be used that qcombobox supports as a source of information to a model and to establish which sheet shows is used rootmodelindex in the next part i create a generic example that involves a qcombobox plus that is defined by another level in addition to observe the dependency will use a qtreeview

Pattern(s): 5	
all of your dbms_output logic is inside the cursor for-loop so will only be evaluated within loops - when there is data


50515492
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 5	
otherwise it is necessary to specify additionally i on copying multiple files or an entire directory tree to inform xcopy that the destination argument should be interpreted as folder path


50518057
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
i want to use the same ssl certificate for both so both can be accessed through https but i m not managing


50518169
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
a for-loop is much better than a while loops in this case


50522974
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
Pattern(s): 7	
next you add the typeconverters annotation to the appdatabase class so that room can use the converter that you ve defined for each entity and dao in that appdatabase appdatabase.java a side note java.util.date is considered to be badly designed and java.util.calendar is much worse


50523442
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	
actually the fix was simple by changing the event to mousedown like that at least for firefox and google-chrome this works much better


50524225
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
visibility means that the elements are not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0


50524225
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
your implementation was near perfect but the last line of code is redundant as visibilityofelementlocated returns the element once the element is visible the elements are not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0


50529157
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
i dont want to get the average because that would be to much at the moment my code has a nested for-loop and loops through 2 lists coinlist where all 100 symbols are listed like this list of indexes called a because the values and quantities are always at the same spot my code so what does this code do 1 loops through every symbol in the symbollist 2 for every found symbol i look for the available quantity 3 if my balance 10 eth is smaller than qty loops breaks 4 if not keeps searching and summarizing every qty in a sum list until there is enough


50529746
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 5	
if i call make -j no number a huge number of compilers will be started and the processors will be used fully cpu states 80.5 user 5.0 kernel cpu 0 idle 15.2 cpu 1 idle 13.2 cpu 2 idle 14.7 memory 0 total 281m avail page size 4k pid tid pri state hh mm ss cpu command 8200 2 21 rcv 0 00 17 12.02 devb-eide 43565087 1 10 rdy 0 00 00 11.38 make 43819103 1 10 rply 0 00 00 3.01 cmake 43716678 1 10 rply 0 00 00 2.80 cmake 43671611 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.87 make 43589671 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.73 make 43569184 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.73 make 43573283 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.46 make 43667514 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.28 make 43839590 1 10 send 0 00 00 1.10 cmake unfortunately when i use make -j having the huge number of concurrent builds means that my limited vm quickly runs out of memory


50530218
goto	break
Pattern(s): 0	
the reason c doesn t have it is that it s even worse than a goto you have to count the nested loops to figure out what it does and it s vulnerable to someone coming along later and adding or removing a level of nesting without noticing that the break count needs to be adjusted


50530963
pull	push
Pattern(s): 5	
given that your pull request is from branch pull-request to develop that could be just git checkout pull-request # check out files from develop they will be immediately staged git checkout develop -- file to revert other_file to revert git commit -m reverted files that should be reverted git push origin pull-request this should add the pull request to no longer include the offending files so you can simply merge it


50533293
build.gradle	gradlew
Pattern(s): 5	5	
please use task.dolast action instead. at build_3icce6xsgr7rsvstratajpe9b.run project build.gradle 138 the javacompile.setdependencycachedir method has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in gradlew 4.0. incremental java compilation is an incubating feature. the taskinputs.source object method has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in gradlew 4.0


50533463
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 5	
in the third line negative s type will be deduced as short because you are casting the type of s from unsigned short to short


50534081
super	self
Pattern(s): 5	
thus the super function should be written as super dev self .__init__ first last pay also for inheritance in python 2.7 your parent class should inherit from object


50537342
uniq	grep
Pattern(s): 5	
get only the second column using cut -d -f2 sort uniq -d to get repeated lines grep -fv 2r to exclude a value or grep -fv -e foo -e bar to exclude multiple values in other words something like this cut -d -f2 input.csv | sort | uniq -d | grep -fv 2r depending on the data it might be faster if you move grep earlier in the pipeline but you should verify that with some benchmarking


50537829
alloca	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
arrays of a size that isn t known at runtime can be allocated with alloca or malloc and then you need to access their contents with load and store


50539103
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
it is not advisable to compare two floats for equality like so it is not a good idea to try to invert the min max values in case min is greater and have a third option in case they are equal


50540971
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
this is how it can be done in objective-c here is how i achieved it in swift result


50541331
textblock	itemscontrol
Pattern(s): 7	
as item datatemplate i have contentcontrol with highlight converter so row will change color and itemspaneltemplate is virtualizingstackpanel and controltemplate of itemscontrol is scrollviewer with nested itemspresenter in background code viewmodel i have function which accepts string and search this string in observablecollection which contains all rows and textblock are made from each row


50541712
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 5	
i think it can be done with addition subtraction multiplication and bitwise operation like bit-shift


50543510
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
you can have http and https servers in the same server section for complete ssl related configuration i would recommend to use mozilla generator yes but you shouldn t


50544208
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 5	
since java does not have an explicit unsigned integer form the best you can do is apply a bitwise operation to the item in advance of displaying it force it to be considered unsigned ...or you can display it using it s hex format which is inherently unsigned


50545611
constexpr	non-type
Pattern(s): 5	
this doesn t work for constexpr values that cannot be passed as non-type template parameters but it does work for integers and pointers and function pointers


50546288
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
you have to give fixed width and height to the .navbar-brand class and then just add following css to the img inside as it will cover up the whole .navbar-brand live example


50549409
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
you can use jsonview s to specify which fields should be included during serializable deserialization


50551555
treemap	linkedhashmap
Pattern(s): 0	
hashmap order not maintains faster than linkedhashmap used for store heap of objects linkedhashmap linkedhashmap insertion order will be maintained slower than hashmap and faster than treemap if you want to maintain an insertion order use this


50551640
min	max	children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	0	7	0	
building a heap only enforces the property in case of min heap every parent is lesser than it children in case of max heap every parent is greater than its children


50556606
multiplying	division
Pattern(s): 5	
since optimized efficiency is your goal we ll speed things up very slightly by using to multiplying a small int value by eight and to perform floored division by two on a positive int solution with slightly improved efficiency we can gain further efficiency at the cost of bad design by combining all three methods into one


50558427
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	0	
as shown below the cluster s height margin is obviously less than its width margin


50559630
queue	fifo
Pattern(s): 5	
wait or queue subsequent executions and continuing to process based on fifo


50559695
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 3	
the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself


50559771
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
the rule of the thumb is cascading should be done from parent to children


50560909
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 10	
in today s modern servers with pretty fast multi-core processors it is more common for a given server request to be limited by i o than by cpu


50562195
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 0	
having said that using functions from tensorflow directly is ok as well say from import tensorflow and use those inside a custom layer might give you more functions than keras backend alone


50567938
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
i have an input type of datetime-local which is working fine in google-chrome but when i try to run the same page in firefox it shows text box instead of datepicker.i have tried using modernizer but still the problem exist can anyone tell me how could the datetime-local issue can be fixed in firefox


50571171
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	0	
i expected the for-loop to be the fastest followed very closely by the while-true loops then the trampolining loops taking 2-10x longer than the for-loop and the naive function loops to take 10-100x longer than the for-loop


50576028
subtraction	addition
Pattern(s): 5	
all we have is and or and not that s why it s hard to implement a sub circuit so now same circuit could be used for addition as well as subtraction which uses 2s complement hack in to perform subtraction by doing addition


50577155
cypher	gremlin
Pattern(s): 0	
gremlin execution time is 50 times more than cypher query. here is the cypher query


50587214

the benchmark shows dplyr is slower by more than a factors of ten microbenchmark microbenchmark myfun1 myfun2 myfun3 myfun4 myfun5 myfun6 unit microseconds expr min lq mean median uq max neval myfun1 5356.6 5739.90 6320.338 5967.45 6327.75 11177.7 100 myfun2 6208.1 6676.55 7220.770 6941.10 7172.55 10936.3 100 myfun3 8645.3 9299.30 10287.908 9676.30 10312.85 15837.1 100 myfun4 4426.1 4712.40 5405.235 4866.65 5245.20 12573.2 100 myfun5 168.6 250.05 292.472 270.70 303.15 2119.3 100 myfun6 141.7 203.15 341.079 237.00 256.45 6278.0 100 the code


50587347
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
its called webdrivermanager and it s a dependency that can be added using maven pom.xml file. this will call the driver during run time with the latest version number. all you need to write now is and you need to add this dependency in the pom.xml file for more information about this please go to github link to check all the rest of the driver like chrome ie etc


50588667
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
with haskell s do notation the above would be written as put and get work with the state being manipulated updated and passed around implicitly


50589741
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 5	
fist of all don t send passwords in the url -- it s just really bad security as the query parameters can get logged in apache or nginx logs and are often exposed along the way


50589927
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 0	
machines have same browser version as mine google-chrome safari browser


50591102
ubuntu	linux	folder	directory
Pattern(s): 5	
solution 1 use virtualbox if you think it s not good idea see solution 2 below open virtualbox you have it already installed along with the docker tools create virtual machine this is optional you can skip it and forward ports from the vm create second ethernet card - bridged this way it will receive ip address from your network it will have ip like docker machine install ubuntu lts which is older than 1 year install docker add shared directory to the virtual machine and automount your project directory this way you have access to the project directory from ubuntu but still can work in windows done bonus everything is working the same way as on linux pause unpause the dockerized environment whenever you want solution 2 use virtualbox this is very similar to the solution 1 but it shows also the thinking process which might be usefull when solving similar issues read that somebody move the folder to c users public and that works try it realize that it doesn t have much sense in your case


50593138
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
Pattern(s): 5	
with html css this would normally be done via mousedown mouseup and mousemove events adjusting the width dynamically


50594836
pull	push
Pattern(s): 10	
having a local git clone that you have to git add commit push then go to the server and git pull is even more dumb


50599682
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	0	
the way functions without prototypes are called is the arguments are promoted lesser than int int types to int and float s to double s and passed to the function in an implementation-defined way


50599798
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 5	5	
we re using one _mm_add_epi16 two _mm_unpackxx_epi16 and two _mm_sub_ps for 8 values the _mm_castsi128_ps are no-ops and the _mm_set would be cached in registers usage demonstration if your input would have been unsigned short the _mm_add_epi16 would not be necessary and the in the _mm_sub_ps would need to be removed of course


50606520
hive	hdfs
Pattern(s): 7	0	
as spark-sql uses hive serdes to read the data from hdfs it is much slower than reading hdfs directly


50608881
subtract	add
Pattern(s): 5	
exim can be made to add argument addresses instead of subtract them by setting the option extract_addresses_remove_arguments false


50615024
clang	llvm	libstdc++	libc++
Pattern(s): 5	
in this instance libjsoncpp.a had symbols like json value std __1 basic_string a constructor that takes a string because it was build with clang and expecting to be linked with llvm s libc++ but i was ultimately attempting to link the final executable with gnu s libstdc++ and the symbol json value std basic_string was unresolved


50615607
width	margin
Pattern(s): 5	
and then set the margin of .outer .inner nth-child 3 .outer .inner nth-child 4 by making the child 3 and 4 to have set its margin and width that will still not exceeds to width of the .outer so that they will still be inline to each other and the other child will occupy the whole row because their margin and width is equal to the width of the .outer


50616264
gson	jackson
Pattern(s): 5	
firstly i tried to manually create instance of jsonobject class provided by gson but it has not implemented getters and can t be serialized by jackson


50616448
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the chars y will be converted to int 121 try this system.out.println int y


50616894
cpu	processors
Pattern(s): 0	
in the case that the associated store eventually does become globally visible you have an interesting time-travel type effect the load on the local cpu has potentially seen the store much earlier than other processors and in particular perhaps it sees it out of order with respect to other stores on the system


50620094
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
your code is wrong because n cannot be converted to int as it is not a numerical chars


50620098
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
i had php versioning 5.5 and i needed to upgrade to 5.6


50620293

versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
there seems to be a couple of issues which you ned to address as follows selenium versioning logs in node depicts selenium versioning 3.12.0 revision 7c6e0b3 time 2018-05-08t15 15 08.936z logs in console depicts selenium versioning 3.6.0 revision 6fbf3ec767 time 2017-09-27t15 28 36.4z jdk versioning logs in node depicts java.version 1.8.0_144 logs in console depicts java.version 1.8.0_77 node startup command the command which you have used to register the node looks error-pront as follows it should have been solution upgrade jdk in selenium grid hub and selenium grid node to recent levels jdk 8u171


50623236
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
in your example if you pass any argument the default value will be ignored and if you do not uncaught referenceerror will be thrown as width and height does not exist provided not defined globally or in the function scope


50623236
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	5	
here the first value in the array will be assigned to width and the second value will be assigned to height


50623791
gif	png
Pattern(s): 5	
you could have saved as png too then use imagepng instead of image gif


50624979
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 7	0	
obviously your checkrate will not measure thefunciwanttomeasure correctly so just to show that a settimeout fn 0 loop will fire at higher rate now even if a nested settimeout loop is better than setinterval what you are doing is a visual animation


50625790
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
i m having jsf application and have upgrade the mojarra versioning from 2.2.15 to 2.3.0 and found that restore view is taking more time than 2.2.15 versioning attached the image


50626648
min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
i thought that for a min-priority heap the elements should be ordered from min to max heapq.heapify li should be the same as li.sort could someone help me understand


50629112
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 0	
in your specific case all the delimiter are more than one spaces whereas the spaces in the names are just single spaces


50643229
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 5	
first change apache listen port 80 to 8080 apache in etc apache2 ports.conf include listen 1.2.3.4 80 to 1.2.3.4 8080 sudo service apache2 restart or sudo service httpd restart in case of centos then add nginx as reverse proxy server that will listen apache port after changes restart nginx server sudo service nginx restart now all traffic will be handled by nginx server and send all dynamic request to apache and static conten is served by nginx server


50644447
gdal	proj
Pattern(s): 5	
the orginal uav image s metadata can not be recognized by gdal so i have to extract them out and then rearrange them to proj the array

any hdfs user account you create should exist as an os or pam or ldap user on the namenode at the very least for any permissions to successfully get acknowledged by hdfs clients


50650624
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
if you read the red line you ll see an error likely around state being an abstract class that expects one or more methods to be defined instance getter and setter methods can be abstract defining an interface but leaving its implementation up to other classes in this case i believe state expects the build method


50650728
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
a max-heap works the same way except the root is the largest node rather than the smallest and parent are larger than their children


50653465
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
meaning the same route name can be used for post and get and other methods which usually lead to different controller methods or even controllers


50657336

i have a checkbox and then i have an anchor tag that displays some text and then will have chevron button to toggle either up or down


50661538
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
probably easier to use a nested map instead achieving the same thing with a for-loop is much more verbose and confusing and shouldn t be done in most cases arrays methods have better abstraction and don t require manual iteration but if necessary


50663140
jar	war
Pattern(s): 5	
no it s not mandatory to deployed war file microservices can also be deployed as jar or war file on the server


50664872
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 5	
simple event timing can be achieved with settimeout and setinterval they work the same as in browser side javascript


50668158

result summary numeric 5 million loops int 1.08 sec 20 faster than variant long 1.09 sec single 1.29 sec variant 1.34 sec double 1.37 sec numeric 25 million loops variant 6.16 sec variant is 9 faster than string string 6.76 sec numbers stored as text 5 million loops int 5.45 sec variant is 32 faster than int variant 7.99 sec therefore it it true arrays of non-variant data types are handled up to 20 faster than an array of variants


50677672
implements	extends
Pattern(s): 5	
when it comes to interfaces the keyword extends can be seen as implements for classes


50681024
median	minimum
Pattern(s): 5	
similarly a 4-level assignment can be made using minimum 1st quartile median 3rd quartile and the maximum


50684115
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
edit regarding parent-child relation our solution for root of diagram was to extend anchor pane as he gives most control to its children every node on this anchor pane had to be umlelement which further down spreads to umlnode and umledge then umlnode has sub-types parentumlnode and childumlnode child can be put inside parent and their position is bound to parent position it doesn t care about outside because of that once parent moves his children follow him respectively


50685951
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
that s why a 32-bit client code should be built as x86 and 64bit as x64


50686468
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
it is because in last iteration of your loops you are accessing the element which is not in the arrays index is higher than size of arrays so try this when length of the string is even you need to keep an edge case check explicitly after your for-loop

inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
this is also a situation where aggregation one class has other classes makes more sense than inherited a subclassing is a superclass


50692457
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 5	
for efficiency in common case of simple case of normal non virtual single inherited the semantics of the vptr of the base class that we then call a primary base class will be augmented with new properties so the vtable for x will be augmented the layout and semantics of the vtable for d will be augmented any properties of a vtable for d is also a properties of the vtable for x the semantic will be inherited there s an inherited of the vtables in parallel with the inherited inside the classes


50692499
octal	decimal

Pattern(s): 5	
yep after a lot of search i found there are three databases approach to build a saas product separate databases for each tenant separate schemas tables and common one database for all tenants shared tables and one database for all tenants finally i decided to use option 2 and i moved to postgresql instead of mysql because postgresql has schema based approach


50708128
lapply	tapply
Pattern(s): 5	
your basic operation can be computed using for row 1 of a the list can be done using lapply - the other options don t give options for the right input output tapply requires a vector input apply only allows a matrix output


50710444
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 10	
in the given question the superclass is the one that has a more general object as the parameter while the subclassing is more specific


50710444
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 10	
in my question the subclassing is less specific than the superclass meaning the subclassing is always able to handle whatever the superclass requires


50710808

octal	decimal	atoi	strtok	strtol	atoi	strtol	strtok	base	fractions
Pattern(s): 5	
strtok modifies its input - so a temporary buffer is used for safety it checks for invalid characters - and will return a non-zero return code if found strtol has been used instead of atoi - as it can detect non-numeric characters in the input scanf has not been used to slurp the input - due to rounding issues with floating point numbers the base for strtol has been explicitly set to 10 to avoid problems with leading zeros otherwise a leading zero will cause the number to be interpreted as octal it uses a num_simple_fraction helper not shown - which in turn uses a gcd helper also not shown - to convert the result to a simple fractions log10 of the numerator is determined by calculating the length of the token after the decimal point

the issue with children referring to their parent is more complex


51140556
mouseover	mouseup
Pattern(s): 5	
your question is a little ambiguous but i believe your activation would be on mouseover or hover and your click would be completed on mouseup or click perhaps you are talking about mouse capture which is not an event at all but a behavior as michaeltracy has stated

51145298
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
if those are smaller than dbl_max_10_exp the range of double is greater than the range of int and we can cast int_max and int_min to double


51145298
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
if this operation overflows it means the range of double is smaller than the range of int and we can use dbl_max -dbl_max as max_double_to_int and min_double_to_int respectively

nsurlconnection	nsurlsession
Pattern(s): 8	
a bit of history before nsurlsession came out a third party library afnetworking became the de facto standard for doing networking in objective c as it provided an easier and more convenient api than nsurlconnection which it was a wrapper around - i think these days it wraps nsurlsession instead


51150873
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 1	
i have configured jar.version as dynamic input to pom.xml i tried to configure maven goal in eclipse s run configuration as i also tried to add jar.version 1.0.1 in parameter section of maven run configuration. but this parameter is not accessible by maven build process

51154321
uilabel	uitextview	uilabel	uibutton
Pattern(s): 7	
in my situation using the uibutton was the best solution because i had a simple single line text i didn t want to use uiview as a container for uilabel i wanted to simplify math calculations for autolayout in my cell i didn t want to use nsparagraphstyle because tailindent works incorrect with autolayout width of uilabel is smaller than expected i didn t want to use uitextview because of possible side effects i didn t want to subclass uilabel less code fewer bugs that s why using the contentedgeinsets from uibutton in my situation become the easiest way to add text margins

51175232
multiplying	division
Pattern(s): 5	
52429 is the closest integer to 2 19 10 so division by 10 can be achieved by multiplying by 52429 and then dividing by 2 19 where the latter is a trivial bit shift operation instead of requiring a full division


51177382
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
to permit broadcasting with boolean arrays you can use numpy.ix_ the magic ix_ performs is noted in the docs boolean sequences will be interpreted as boolean masks for the corresponding dimension equivalent to passing in np.nonzero boolean_sequence . as a side note you can use a more direct approach if you have int indices see also related question on why this method does not work with boolean arrays

51229306
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
this question doesn t make much sense as it excludes sed and awk which would be the obvious answers and also restricts the solution to a for-loop whereas a while loops is the more usual choise


51229808
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
if your compiler supports c++11 you can just use range-based for-loop which is much easier to read than this normal loops

serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
auto access setting which means that visibility rules are to be used to automatically determine read- and or write-access of this property. read_only access setting that means that the property may only be read for serializable but not written set during deserialization. read_write access setting that means that the property will be accessed for both serializable writing out values as external representation and deserialization reading values from external representation regardless of visibility rules. write_only access setting that means that the property may only be written set for deserialization but will not be read get on serializable that is the value of the property is not included in serializable

51259736
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays	int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
i wonder if there is any way to do what the for-loop does any faster you have the chars arrays indata 4 0x30 0x30 0x3f 0x3f you want an int time 255 output indeed you can unroll loops to at the same time using potentially less expensive shift operations rather than pow


51261269
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
without parentheses is evaluated as because the multiplication has a higher precedence than the addition +

51290893
do.call	lapply
Pattern(s): 7	
the easiest way to create that is using lapply as follows then if you want to create a single data.frame out of those you could use dplyr bind_rows migr2010 data.table rbindlist migr2010 or do.call rbind migr2010 although do.call is much slower than the other two

nullpointerexception	illegalstateexception
Pattern(s): 5	
parameters clientid - the client identifier with which this message is associated if any message - the message to be appended throws illegalstateexception - if this method is called after this instance has been released nullpointerexception - if message is null which of course raises the question what a non-associated message could mean is it displayed or not or queued somewhere - association is just a word with zero explanatory force in this context

Pattern(s): 7	
a typical reader can figure out what a getattr means more easily than figuring out a setattr plus a descriptor __get__ call to manually bind a method obviously. and it still won t help many static tools understand your type s methods


51388112
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 5	
if the layout ends up being taller than what can fit on the screens there are performance gains to be had by switching to a collectionview

a faster convert function multiplication is always slower that sum and shift therefore change multiplying with shift


51393834
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
as ulrich eckhardt pointed out a better way to implement this is to use a for-loop it s more clear this way and the scope of ptr is limited to loops which is good because we don t need it later


51398760
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 5	
yet another way to do it without the primary key would be using the json functions or pre 5.7.22 ordering or filtering can be done before grouping .

51450502
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
pl_strtab silently get touched in children on any attempt to use hashes. problem even worse because huge percentage of modules we preload are cpan modules - there is no way to know which of them overuse hashes resulting in increased memory footprint of parent process


51451578
nsnull	nsstring
Pattern(s): 5	
of type nsnull cannot be converted to nsstring below is my code where it s breaking i ve console logged user so i know it s an object but i keep getting this error the else block runs

Pattern(s): 10	
you have to replace the touchesbegan with a tapgesture or replace the uilongpressgesturerecognizer with touchesended but is more precise the first option


51491867
sorting	filtering	put	get
Pattern(s): 3	
angular doesn t offer such pipes because they perform poorly and prevent aggressive minification ... the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself this means you should get rid of your pipe and put the logic directly inside your component


51492457
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 7	
but building a network and debugging it in tensorflow is more time consuming than keras


51493349
width	height

versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
it is a reported bug on npm which versioning above 6.0.0 do not support node versioning under node 6.0.0. if you run node -v there is a strong suspicion that your node versioning is older than node 6.0.0 i ran in the same difficulties by innocently upgrading npm from versioning 2.14.20 to the latest stable versioning with nodejs on v4.4.0. problem is that you cannot just upgrade node since as you mentionned npm is totally blocked


51500390
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
i m not 100 certain but i m fairly sure this has to do with the fact that your variable operater is an int but you re assigning a chars to it this works - chars can be assigned to int and then comparing it back to the int eg doing so to fix it either use the chars in your switch or assign the int 1 2 3 4 rather than the chars 1 2 3 4

51507022
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 5	
this issue is particularly problematic in situations where a linq query is used such as points.distinct as the resulting points may be considered equals if comparing directly such as personally i believe the best option would be to change equals as follows such that it s behaviour is consistent with gethashcode however as this is already heavily utilised within an application this would be a significant breaking change


51507022
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 5	
i believe it is the wrong thing to do but i m considering changing gethashcode to my understanding is that the above would force the equals method to be utilised which would result in a performance hit but also allow for points within a tolerance to be considered equals within linq queries

hive	hdfs	namenode	hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	
first check out this hortonworks guide some personal notes bare minimum depending on replication factor of 3 you need about 50tb 10x3 30tb 80 rule 40tb usable this give you 8tb to work with - so 5 nodes at 10tb a piece for hdfs hdfs can only use a maximum of 80 of total cluster space more nodes faster yarn jobs hive pig can read compressed data as if it was uncompressed i d personally start with 5 nodes 3 for a zookeeper quorum and 2 can be assigned namenode all of them can be set to datanodes don t forget about an ambari server and make this a vm...you ll need backups and snapshots daily upgrades updates can blow stuff up always have a plan if a job fails sometimes the most basic install doesn t go as planned


51602586
apache	nginx	ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
items you will need an ssl certificate for your domain available for free from letsencrypt.org a web server on the pi since motion doesn t use any installed webserver but instead has its own inbuilt one - i d recommend nginx or apache certbot to generate install the certificate on the pi configure the web server to be a reverse proxy and serve the http motion website as https using your ssl certificate secure the website both apache and nginx support http basic authentication which if the reverse proxy is configured correctly will be served over https so encrypted which is better than unencrypted base64 encoded and easily decoded credential info transmitted in the clear for all to see intercept

multiplying	transpose
Pattern(s): 5	
this corresponds to multiplying a column vector to the transpose matrix from the right thus multiplying a vector from the left to a matrix corresponds to multiplying it from the right to the transpose matrix this means if a matrix is defined like this and the matrix uniform mat4 transformation is set like this see gluniformmatrix4fv then that the vector has to be multiplied to the matrix from the right but of course the matrix can be set up transpose or can be transposet when set to the uniform variable then that the vector has to be multiplied to the matrix from the left note that the glm api documentation refers to the opengl shading language specification 4.20

i know about the one where the width is set and you use top bottom padding to maintain a certain aspect ratio like so but in my case i need the height to be set and width to be variable


51641581
seaborn	matplotlib
Pattern(s): 5	
i m using matplotlib version of violinplot instead of seaborn s because the former returns a dictionary with the various artists that were produced although the same could be done with seaborn with a bit more effort to locate the proper collection object

post	put	post	get	put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
the main difference between the two is restlets can be used with get post put delete requests this makes it ideal if you are building and api which you can use in another application


51642050
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
suitelets can be used with get post


51643429
division	modulo

51656070
min	max	division	modulo
Pattern(s): 7	7	
so if you really want to remove the values one by one like in your current algorithm you should store the current bounds but of course you do not need to work by increments and you could directly set the right min max bounds using integer division and of course but i don t know what is the context of your question you do not need to define a new constraint you can just use the predefined modulo expressions in the model that is posting at the concert level


51656917
namedtuple	dictionary
Pattern(s): 10	
however in some cases where i m writing tests i do keyword packing unpacking and in these cases dictionary is much more maintainable as i don t need to change to a 1 b 2 it also helps in some circumstances where i think i might want to turn it into a namedtuple or class instance at a later time


51656942
bokeh	plotly	bokeh	seaborn	neo4j	arangodb	plotly	vis.js	plotly	seaborn
Pattern(s): 5	
similar stuff can be done with vis.js node.js neo4j arangodb but as i see python libraries for that like seaborn plotly bokeh their graphs are not interactive


51661731
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
chars can be represented with int in consequence you would be able to concatenate those int and generate an int that represents the whole string


51662523
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
you need to change height and add change layout_gravity to gravity like the code bellow it probably will solve your problems if you want to improve your code i suggest you not to set fixed width and height it cand bring you problems in some devices


51662759
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
for example multiplication is of higher precedence than addition so 2 + 3 x 4 is equivalent to 2 + 3 x 4 not 2 + 3 x 4

width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero


51666938
x86	y86
Pattern(s): 7	
so you can also access them through array0 as single array of 10 values mainarray .long array0 array1 array2 array3 now if you want value 2 3 the value 8 you can t simply multiply row value 2 by column size like in the matrix16x16 example because rows don t have fixed length so you will instead calculate offset into mainarray first like i will use x86 at t syntax because i don t know y86 but you should be able to get the idea as they are basically the same instructions just y86 has more limited instruction set and you have more verbose and cryptic syntax with more prefix suffix parts of instruction name sorry for not using y86 but as i said i don t know it.


51672962
qtableview	qtablewidget
Pattern(s): 5

if you wonder why this kind of vectorization is useful it is because a loop written by a compiled-language is faster than a loop written in an interpreted-language


51683080
pull	push
Pattern(s): 5	
a better architecture might be when there is work to be done push it to an amazon sqs queue or store details in amazon s3 and push a message that points to amazon s3 create a cloudwatch alarm that triggers when the size of the queue is greater than zero the alarm can trigger a lambda function that starts the gpu node the gpu instance has software running that pull work from the sqs queue when there is no work remaining the gpu instance calls shutdown on the operating system


51690997
folder	dir
Pattern(s): 5	
a problem that i m having is with command import this is all the commands are stored in a folder called lib in the root folder of prosser and inside it can have folder and files if a folder is in the lib dir it can t be named as folder anymore its name now is package but this doesn t care for now

51712611
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
by default dragging the table from the data sources window onto the designer surface generates a datagridviewcheckboxcolumn for isnegative like so an ordinary checkbox has the appearance property which can be set to button to make it look like a toggle button but a datagridviewcheckboxcolumn doesn t seem to have an equivalent property


51712907
division	subtraction
Pattern(s): 0	
unsigned division of 64-bit division by 32-bit divisor by repeated subtraction of divisor from dividend with remainder may be faster than regular division if the dividend is not expected to be much bigger than the divisor

it s real unfortunate that the json you retrieve via get can t be inserted via put without stripping all of this out first though


51719655
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
to make the imageview always scale to fit the screen in my case the key solution was to set the constraint for the width the longest size you might want to set it for height if your image is height is bigger than width of the imageview equal to 1 superview width


51721626
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
i would like to set up a subdomain on my virtual server with debian 9 and apache 2 which points to a directory at var www html test. ssl and let s encrypt is also enabled so the subdomain should be reached with https too

51742901
verilog	vhdl	rtl	vhdl	rtl	verilog
Pattern(s): 2	
with verilog being closer to c syntax it might be easier to start there and i also prefer it over vhdl but let s not get into religious discussions i know that emacs and sigasi editors provide auto-format options for rtl languages but their format options are strict and i don t like the outcome hence i intend to make the formatting style configurable i ran into this work it might be useful to build on it if possible

swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 10	
also i m looking forward if there any better ways to do orm in swift currently the code does working with dynamic object creation but when comes with orm relation it really drove me nuts here just looking for ways to manage it in a easier and more manageable ways where currently it looks like there are not much functionalities to do meta programming a lot of other orm libs still using objective-c which is much more easier but boilerplate on dynamic instance creation or class inspection

51776094
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 7	
although i would recommend against using inherited to hide properties in your dtos dtos are declarative models used to define your service contracts hiding their properties behind inherited makes it harder for anyone reading it to know exactly what each service accepts and returns


51777913
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 5	
union can be replaced with union all in my suggestion as the second query already produces a distinct result and the result from the first query is also free of duplicates in the result of the second query because the o is always different

another way would be to replace each for-loop with an sapply which is faster than for loops and doesn t require the use of expand.grid


51836755
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	0	
and i ve found that you use input.mouseposition as the index to seek pixel in texture.you also should note that once they donnot match if the pixel coordinates are out of bounds larger than width height or small than 0 they will be clamped or repeated based on the texture s wrap mode


51852942
.when	each
Pattern(s): 5	
so you will get more information about scaling horizontal here in elasticsearch terms when you start two or more instances on es in same network with same cluster configs then they will connect to each other and create a distributed network.so if you add one more computer or node and started one es instance there and keep the cluster config same that node will automatically will get attached to the previous cluster and the data and the request load will be shared .when you make any request to es may be its a read or write request each request can be processed parallel and you get the speed according to the no of node and shards in them of each index

51871968
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
you can set the width and height of an iframe to configure how much of the website will be visible at one time but making the width and height smaller than the width and height of the embedded website will just cause scrollbars to appear so the user can scroll to see the whole website


51885475
multiplying	division
Pattern(s): 7	
there could be a few minor enhancements to be made such as multiplying by 0.5 instead of dividing by 2.0 as division is slower but the basic premise should hopefully help


51894355
next	except
Pattern(s): 5	
implementation consider this 6x3 dataset example in which each row represents an input example and each column represents a feature for the example first we need to create a covariance matrix of the features of each input and that s why we set the parameter rowvar to false in the numpy.cov function so each column represents a variable then we find the inverse of the covariance matrix but before proceeding we should check -as mentioned above- if the matrix and its inverse are symmetric and positive definite we use for this cholesky decomposition algorithm fortunately it s already implemented in numpy.linalg.cholesky def is_pos_def a if np.allclose a a.t try np.linalg.cholesky a return true except np.linalg.linalgerror return false else return false next we find the mean m of the variables on each feature shall i say dimension and save them in an array like this note that i repeated each row just to avail of matrix subtraction as will be shown next

google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
i have to access through excel vba to a web that is only compatible with google-chrome or firefox not ie


52173824
chef	inspec
Pattern(s): 7	
generally serverspec is used with chef via the test kitchen integration testing framework though these days inspec is more popular


52174683
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 1	
two of the sub-selects were too slow as client-side queries in access so i created them as server-side views which worked better but still had room for improvement


52179204
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
Pattern(s): 5	
in your case you have given flex-basis 300px and padding 10px so each box width will be since you didn t set box-sizing border-box padding will be included in width


52179373
post	put
Pattern(s): 5	
i tried sending encoding in http request s content encoding field but it doesn t seem to have any effect also in post request content encoding to be used for post put patch and file


52180348
eventlet	gevent
Pattern(s): 2	
if you want to use threads as your execution pool you can choose between eventlet an gevent


52185740
interpolation	splines
Pattern(s): 0	
i am quite free in terms of the type of the interpolation but it shouldn t be too fancy nothing crazier than a splines or a low order polynomial


52187601
imperative	declarative
Pattern(s): 10	
typically declarative code is better then imperative code


52188903
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 5	
what you want is called proxying and can be achieved via nginx or apache


52192405
terraform	packer
Pattern(s): 3	
for code changes i recommend using packer to build ami s as a part of your ci pipeline it can definitely be cumbersome to manage launch config changes with terraform and asg s given how buggy it can be but i think the result is much cleaner and safer than updating code with ansible


52192411
hide	show
Pattern(s): 5	
both of them can be used to show hide columns on device size


52192411
hide	show
Pattern(s): 5	
same concept can be used to hide show columns


52194229
super	self
Pattern(s): 5	
however a better way to deal with that is arguably to use -format strings in the log calls for example logging.debug starting s self.name finally the line super .__init__ could be changed to super device self .__init__ all other things being equal your code looks cross-compat now


52194456
printwriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 1	
i m somewhat familiar with printwriter and bufferedwriter etc but i m not sure what to do when i want to print out results that exist on the console such as below where the questions are system.out.print and the digits 3 18 19 are user input


52194954
prop	each
Pattern(s): 5	
if it is rejected with a redux-form submissionerror containing errors in the form field1 error field2 error then the submission errors will be added to each field to the error prop just like async validation errors are


52196231
opencv	skimage	scipy	skimage
Pattern(s): 5	
i know that there are similar algorithms like floodfill watershed and distancetransform implemented in opencv scipy and skimage that are really fast but don t give me the path i want


52197164
strstr	substr
Pattern(s): 0	
so you can effectively use or but a really fast way in you case could be as strpos is stated to be less consuming and more faster than strstr and also because you use all the same substr


52197196
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 7	
change working directory to folder which contains zip_this_folder first cd desktop zip -r zip_this_folder zip_this_folder

strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 7	
i know strncpy is a safer version of strcpy as said here


52208560
xslt	xquery
Pattern(s): 5	
so an alternative is to simply convert to from json object before and after transformation - and of course this could be done in xquery which might be preferable before running the xslt


52209825
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
have tried returning boolean int string values and adapting - nothing with each variant


52209847
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
this appears because chars evaluation like that you have above is done by comparing the code points which also is why chars types can be treated as int


52211587
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 10	
in general if you want something to occur at a set interval setinterval is a better alternative to settimeout


52211737
flask	django
Pattern(s): 5	
this is for django but i m sure it could be adapted for flask


52214018
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
5 tries of 100 mill ops 1st try may be considered warm-up put is 100 collisions get is 50 hits


52214018

Pattern(s): 0	
note that synchronized-hashmap is slower than hashtable puts 2x slower gets 50 slower the code used for the test as a junit


52215307
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
appreciate if somebody guide me through simple example which can be run on google-chrome firefox browser


52215565
oncreate	onnewintent
Pattern(s): 5	
if you are passing extras to an intent from activity a and they are not received at the receiving activity b oncreate then activity b already exists in android backstack and the extras are not caught in oncreate but they can be found in onnewintent pls try below code hope this will work for sure


52216472
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
the compiler isn t allowed by the standard to do the conversion to for you the ellipsis notation in the declaration of printf means that default argument promotions occur but that affects only the float type and int types smaller than int short chars etc


52222915
webkit	gecko
Pattern(s): 1	
i m facing weirdly inconsistent rendering between webkit and gecko


52226084
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
well in other programming languages like c the int would be converted into chars or chars and would undergo operation 2.


52226988
bottle	flask
Pattern(s): 7	10	0	
as of sep18 also have a look on quart apistar as of mar19 add fastapi looks very promising nota bottle is lighter faster than flask but with less bells whistles falcon is fast


52227114
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
well in other programming languages like c the int would be converted into chars or chars and would undergo operation 2.


52228566
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
ch must have type int instead of chars for the test to behave correctly


52230314
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i need to create a very simple design a card image + title + some text a button simple button that is fixed in the bottom of any screen now requirement is to make sure it renders great on most popular modern devices iphone ipad androids but also if opened on pc this is what i did so far it sort of works but a i can not resolve the following on mobile devices where width is smaller than height - the card is too small i need it to be spreaded around a bit more so that it tried to occupy most of the space but was still always centered both vertically and horizontally


52234124
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
this is the same situation for a linked list or for any data structure where there is a notion of next but not a notion of size instead there is some sentinel value that marks the end nul -terminated strings in c or a way to check whether there is a next element iterator in java there are also situations that can be handled with a for-loop but a while loops is more elegant


52234124
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
a for-loop for this will then typically look like this in order to skip the iterations from the actual number of iterations up to the upper bound which would much better be expressed as while not terminationconditionreached dosomethinginteresting end using the for-loop could make sense in this situation if the value of i is of interest a last situation i can think of where a while loops is more appropriate than a for-loop even though the number of iterations is bounded by a known constant is if that constant is not semantically interesting for loops


52234124
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
however i would still like to find an example for that which is not also an example of a semantically un-interesting termination condition. so we have two classes of situations here one where a for-loop simply cannot be used when the bound is unknown non-existant or infinite and one where a for-loop can be used but a while loops is more intention-revealing


52234935
pandas	seaborn	seaborn	matplotlib
Pattern(s): 5	
most of them will be created with matplotlib within a loop but i would need also to include pandas plots and dataframes the whole view and seaborn plots


52235218
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
since int are wider than chars an int containing the value a typically contains one byte with the value a and one or more bytes with the value zero


52236432
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
recently i installed ssl cetificates through certbot on apache2 server and my website can be accessed through https


52237695
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 0	
the results were as follows data.list.sort 0.171s mergesort 1.092s 6x slower than data.list.sort quicksort 1.152s 7x slower than data.list.sort


52244943
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 2	
go to src folder and choose mark as directory then choose the option called source root that would fix your problem


52247848
teamcity	jenkins
Pattern(s): 1	
as an example i freely use newman with teamcity ci it s paid tool accordingly people less use paid tool and more a free tool so an explanation as an example given for jenkins as for the most usable ci


52248708
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
the chars are large enough to require a full int value - and there may be more than one chars per cell. the video attributes and color are stored in separate fields of the structure. each cell row and column in a window is stored as a cchar_t. for the video attributes pay attention to the portability section of the attributes manual page


52249744
express	node.js
Pattern(s): 1	
i m pretty new with node.js and i m trying to implement simple user registration and login form using node.js express bcrypt express-session and mongoose


52250100
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 5	
my generator looks like the x_generate is then passed into the discriminator which is still written in tensorflow and yet to be converted to keras


52250143
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
the outer div does not have width height restrictions example outerdiv does not have set width or height


52250228
cocoapods	carthage
Pattern(s): 0	
carthage is my favourite manager so i can speak to that more than cocoapods


52255222
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
sample code below was written in xamarin.ios but i believe it can be transfered to swift objective-c easily


52257323
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 0	
in python 2 -1 string compares greater than 0 int - it raises a typeerror in python 3.x - and in both cases a non-empty string evals to true in a boolean context


52257333
ng-switch	ng-show
Pattern(s): 5	
i know this question is three years old and probably irrelevant but there s the following solution in angular 1.2+ the -start and -end postfixes can be used with ng-show ng-if ng-switch ng-repeat and your own directives if multielement true is set


52259284
pubnub	pusher
Pattern(s): 1	
and there are multiple other things to consider such as considerations for real-time api s what events to send to the client how to send each client only the events they need how to handle authorization for events where to keep state on the event subscriptions for stateless services how to recover from missed events due to lost connections and service crashes producing events for search- or pagination queries how to scale publish subscribe solutions there are multiple pub sub solutions out there such as pusher pubnub socketcluster etc


52260248
int	double
Pattern(s): 2	
in my code i can work around the problem by using double or explicitely casting int to the template type t but when i try to work with i get into trouble for the methods which compare against int literals like the _div method above


52262050
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
the below json data has employeenumber with tbd and number i would need only tbd count form the json and to be attached the parent from the above json i would like to have total count of tbd and add the count to parent name sam 4tbd 0fte and the children tbd count to ravi 3tbd 3fte and if is manager is true expected output i tried with below one thanks in advance for all the help


52262839
multiplying	add
Pattern(s): 7	
skl runs addps on the fma unit as well dropping the dedicated fp multiplying unit so add latency is higher but throughput is higher


52262857
hide	show
Pattern(s): 5	
the hidden attribute must not be used to hide content that could legitimately be show in another presentation


52262891
margin	height
Pattern(s): 5	
height cannot be set using margin


52267421
chisel	hdl
Pattern(s): 1	
i am not familiar enough with chisel or dsels but i do know its not just a compilation step to hdl


52270320
primes	modulus
Pattern(s): 7	
in particular original ntt required to find primes n as the working modulus that is larger than so that the result never overflows


52273492
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
so the height is supposed to be bigger than the width as per requested designs


52273652
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 5	
any properties of the ui classes that you do not see defined are inherited from their base data clases


52275912
rtp	sip
Pattern(s): 5	
my question is whether it will supprt secured sip and rtp protocols as i have not seen any methods described for the same.also whether it has provision for client server authentication


52275980
tensorflow	bazel
Pattern(s): 5	
when using the tensorflow tools with bazel should be installed by tensorflow source code with bazel


52276163
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 1	
i would not try to sort first then binary search as filtering is a o n operation and sorting a o nlog n on top of which you have to add a binary search


52278484
vim	atom-editor
Pattern(s): 5	
that is to say change to that would be great if it can be implemented via vim or atom-editor


52285395
addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 1	
the code is equivalent to i ve added the parentheses for clarity but they are not necessary as multiplication has precedence over addition


52289965
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
then i decided to change the if statement to to change the layout of the page elements when the viewport width is greater than the height and vice versa


52290811
post	put
Pattern(s): 10	
so the put api are fair and clean and when you encounter a post it s better you dig a little bit more


52291391
draggable	droppable
Pattern(s): 7	
however i only want 1 of the droppable elements to be triggered even if the draggable item is touching more than 1


52293163
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
be aware that the structure might collapse if you haven t specified a height and width of the elements


52294885
qlist	qvector
Pattern(s): 10	
edit if you dont need it to interact with other api alot you can use qvector to replace qlist which is faster according to qt official


52295722
packets	pcap
Pattern(s): 1	
if you are not familiar with pcap library then you could write a simple bash script which redirects the all packets captured data into a file and then use awk sed filtering techniques to find out the tcp sequence and ack numbers


52298842
g++	gcc	rpm	yum
Pattern(s): 5	
and made a link ln -sf usr bin gcc-8.2 gcc . i did the same for g++ and gfortran. i wanted to reinstall gcc-8.2.0 and went ahead to make clean in the gcc-8.2 directory. when i try . configure i get that c compiler cannot create executables the links i made are broken. the system gcc-4.4.7 cannot be found which gcc gives no gcc sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ gives gcc is already installed. i tried to install an rpm which fails because of dependencies. i have pg compilers installed in opt pgi when i configure with i still get c compiler cannot create executables i tried the following c++ programm with the command opt pgi linux_86_64 12.08 bin pgcpp hello.cpp -o hello it gives compilation error that float.h not found


52301409
couchbase	couchdb
Pattern(s): 8	
as of couchbase lite 2.0 it is no longer compatible with couchdb


52304183
fadein	fadeout
Pattern(s): 10	10	
using setinterval we could rewrite your function as the first parameter of your fadein fadeout is time more info


52305193
squash	merge
Pattern(s): 10	
squash is no longer and option because git rebase-i head 2 i ve done a merge at some point and can t do that - because in the middle of a rebase my changes couldn t be applied because i some how got behind remote by squash - i must have done it wrong


52306521
noexcept	throw
Pattern(s): 5	
edit i just want to clarify given the noexcept specification that throw should terminate the program regardless

post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
i am following this question listview get multiple entry values to validate and send i need now to serialize data to send it to the server i ve got this far please help me get all the data correctly to be sent via post


52322978
serializable	deserialization	getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	5	
recently i had the same issue using jackson-annotation 2.9.0 and lombok 1.18.2 this is what worked for me so basically adding the annotation means that the property may only be written for deserialization using setter but will not be read on serializable using getter


52324038
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	10	
first of all using a for-loop is better than using a while loops here now to answer your question you can use random.choice to exclude range j - 5 j + 5 if you only want to use randint an alternative is to use a while loops to keep rerolling value k until it does not fall in the j +- 5 range as shadowranger points out the while loops strategy is less computational demanding and is easier to read so you might want to go for that


52326949
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 0	
as ekscrypto in swift 4 or later all functions need objective-c if you use less versiÃ³n than swift 4 is enoguh objective-c in class


52327032
subtraction	add
Pattern(s): 5	
you have to add the extra data with name and value indexes where name holds the name of the variable to be posted and value is the value of the variable you want to append but before i suggest the actual code you have a few things to look after you cannot name a variable containing - like you have declared hyphens can be mistaken as subtraction attempts


52327847
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
the query should be converted from int to boolean here is the code


52327987
shapefile	geojson
Pattern(s): 7	0	
geojson is much simpler than shapefile kml or gml and it used widely on webgis.we can easily conveter shapefile to it with geotools


52334302
sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 0	
will work as long as all your users are on the planet after making all the calculations use an array sorting method to find the x closest nodes to each node and there you have it you may or may not want to prevent a user being grouping on more than one grouping but that s just business logic actual code would be a little too much to provide at this time without seeing some of your progress first but this is basically what you need to do algoritmically


52336116
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
this should set the default type for all columns as chars while time would be parsed as int


52337238
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
then you can use dynamodb streams with a lambda that looks at each update and checks if latest is less than min or greater than max


52338362
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
prints 9 this is because d means print int value and any int with size less than int like a chars is promoted aka converted to int when calling printf


52338691
uistackview	uicollectionview
Pattern(s): 3	
for your current problem i recommend using uistackview horizontal with distribution set to fillequally and if items exceed screen width embed it inside a uiscrollview or use a uicollectionview instead


52340081
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 5	
in your second you also have three other characters which will be treated as delimiter so the words are humans cats and dogs if you really wanted to process a spaces delimiter list of quoted strings then tell scan to use blank as the delimiter and add the q modifier to allow quoted strings

52343326
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
we have two problems here some of the udp packages are being dropped at some network hops because they are bigger than their mtu when a service get a number of commands to announce bigger than the max datagram size it will not be able to work with the rest isolated forever... because of what i have wrote above i am going to port the network layer of swim-js to use tcp which allows reliable communication


52345041
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 1	
to give some further clarification i ve included the diagram presented in the node.js documentation these phases can be read about in much more detail at in short summary timers scheduled callbacks and anything set on timers will execute here such as setinterval or settimeout

stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 5	
the normal output will be found in stdout and all errors in stderr


52353743
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
the tricky part is the parent active mode and passive mode can be shuffled so the active mode would be after passive mode the children local eu and international ww can also be shuffled a parent might be missing or a child might be missing so there is a chance that there is no active mode which means i should get something like none one possible solution i thought of was to somehow convert the flat string into a multi-layer dictionary list or json but i don t know how am i suppose to do it


52356571
post	put
Pattern(s): 5	
put another way everything we do in http could be done with post - what the other methods do is allow us to unlock optimizations in generic consumers observers of the messages

these are the stackoverflow links - is custom kibana plugin installation in aws elasticsearch possible kibana read only dashboard how to block selected kibana subpages using nginx kibana dashboard only mode another approach is given at this link applying read only permission to kibana dashboard but this would lock the .kibana index and it would be a problem for other users using it


52387073
stdout	fflush
Pattern(s): 0	
i m pretty sure you guys aren t experiencing any errors the adding of n does nothing more than fflush your printing buffer and make it in fact a visible indication within your stdout or a terminal for this matter


52387276
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 7	
you re probably loading all of the data in your ram thus allocating all memory available forcing your system to rely on swap memory writing temporary data to the disk which is much slower


52389781
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
i might be late to the party but easy and fast solution without or minimal downtime could be aws database-migration-service which can be used to upgrade your database to a different versioning as well as to some other server or rds

in other words just like is treated as because multiplication has higher precedence than addition the precedence of that example code works like this so f# processes this as which becomes


52394907
hash	salt
Pattern(s): 10	
after all you could do this insert into accounts user salt password values myuser 1234 sha2 concat xyzzy 1234 256 but now you the password xyzzy appears in plain-text in your query logs and binary logs even if it is stored in hash form in the table itself


52395646
alarmmanager	wakelock
Pattern(s): 5	
i believe the issue at hand is my bad implementation of one of the 3 resources which either cause the foregroundservice to get killed the alarmmanager to get cleared or the wakelock to not aquire

swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
let s assume we have the following objective-c class now if no nullability annotations are specified either explicitly or via ns_assume_nonnull_begin ns_assume_nonnull_end then the name property will be imported in swift as string


52401625

maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
2 but if i open a multi-module maven project the debugger cannot start because of java.lang.classnotfoundexception org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.springbootservletinitializer 3 the project can be built with maven and running the jar is all right i guess the problem is because of the classpath settings however to my understanding the .classpath file should be derived from the pom.xml file which should be correct otherwise maven would have not been able to build the project


52405640
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
finally your while loops really only counts and so a for-loop is more appropriate


52410600
mouseleave	mouseenter
Pattern(s): 3	
i would recommend using mouseenter and mouseleave instead


52410905
interpolation	splines
Pattern(s): 0	
that is you could use to give but for the more interesting case of images like you mention at the end of your question then the axes probably won t be integer multiples and you ll be better served by a splines or other type interpolation


52415447
int	chars	tinyint	nvarchar	tinyint	varchar
Pattern(s): 0	
case sql server uses the following precedence order for data types user-defined data types highest sql_variant xml datetimeoffset datetime2 datetime smalldatetime date time float real decimal money smallmoney bigint int smallint tinyint bit ntext text image timestamp uniqueidentifier nvarchar including nvarchar max nchar varchar including varchar max chars varbinary including varbinary max binary lowest data type precedence so this expression has data type of datetime since datetime has a higher precedence than int


52416114
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
it has to be created with loops such as a for-loop and if statements


52416550

52421025
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
but height is smaller for 300px width image and larger for 600px width images


52429893
lisp	smalltalk
Pattern(s): 10	
as it is commonly implemented smalltalk is focused on messages being sent to methods making decisions at runtime and common lisp is more focused on macros calling non-generic functions making many but not all decisions at compile-time. these are fundamental design and implementation decisions but there s no reason you couldn t create a lisp that had a more smalltalky feel by utilizing clos and deferring more decisions to runtime


52430122
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
for instance if wanted to write something like bivariategraphics iris_data petalwidth sepalwidth the second and third arguments would be construed as height and width not x and y


52434587
min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
if you have specific time frames you want people to insert this can be added by min and max


52435195
ienumerable	idictionary
Pattern(s): 5	
i would have preferred to have injected an idictionary but because of the limitation with injecting ienumerable into the constructor this limitation is unity specific i came up with a little workaround


52435605
xlib	cairo
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i m guessing png type cairo takes longer than xlib because it produces antialiased output


52437686
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
the for-loop does not execute the command goto if the user entered string consists only of digits as in this case nothing can be assigned to loops variable i


52439697
white-box	assertions
Pattern(s): 7	
that would extremely white-box and expects far more than the functional spec. question currently my conclusion is that i can not utilize the .received instead i must install callbacks for all the 4 overloads and set a variable inside them and in the assertions part i examine that variable


52442040
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
to check a checkbox radio button value you can use checkbox.checked where checkbox is your dom object selected by queryselector


52443439
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
so as per the recommendation it should not be returned in the response of put request and a subsequent get call should be made to get the status of the emails


52443827
prop	each	stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 5	
which also allows to simplify the component and make it a stateless function one thing to keep in mind alertplace function prop will be recreated each time state.geography.place changes so if the connected stateful component was something complex you would like to avoid re-rendering too often not in this case with a simple button further changes are needed


52445821
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	blink

just use apiversion v1 kind endpoints metadata name external-server subsets - addresses - ip aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd - ip aaa.bbb.ccc.eee - ip aaa.bbb.ccc.fff ports - name metrics port 9100 protocol tcp and a new target with several endpoints will be added to prometheus targets .


52449504
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
this was an earlier versioning of node that i didn t want to use so the solution for me was to either remove the local node.exe so the one listed in would be used or upgrade the local node.exe file if the node.exe.config is really needed


52450074
getattr	setattr
Pattern(s): 5	
the property can be accessed via name using getattr the property can be set using setattr


52451664
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 0	
filtering and concat since you don t care about the order other than these two grouping and you know the larger array has all the elements from the smaller rather than sorting you could just filtering all critarray items out of array than concatenate critarray and array this assumes _id is a unique identifier


52451838
hk2	guice
Pattern(s): 10	
i know that jersey uses hk2 as default di and because hk2 is performance loss the alternative di is guice which is better we need to configure jersey to use guice using guice-hk2-bridge


52453489
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	7	
the width is fine but one of them is shaped like a square and the height is longer while the other is rectangle and the height is shorter and i know its because of the way video was taken one was taken vertically and the other horizontally


52454347
int	double
Pattern(s): 10	10	
it is highly probable that representing small maps by an array of pairs of int double is more efficient both in terms of memory and in terms of cpu time


52455473
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
if i have not misunderstood since my nodes depend on my message assemblies when i upgrade one node i also have to upgrade their dependencies to the same major versioning so that i ll be forced to upgrade my message assemblies too


52457528
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
to check by doing would require you to implement your arrays as below and it will look for keys that are identical to your search or if you want to search for a word in the keys of an associative arrays or with a foreach however doing it with a for-loop is faster and more optimized


52457878
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
go to an android v7.0 tablet acer b3-a40 and the same changes can be realized on firefox but google-chrome fails


52459054
comparator	icomparer
Pattern(s): 0	
i tried both using comparison and custom icomparer with comparison with custome icomparer both custom comparator and comparison have same logic code but i was suprised that the performance of sorting by comparison is better than comparator

min	max
Pattern(s): 2	
how can i make the program randomly choose difficulty between min and max difficulty


52463760
stdout	fflush
Pattern(s): 5	
in fact it s probably not being sent at all and instead buffered inside of stdout but that could be fixed with fflush stdout after printf


52470127
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
that leaves the objective-c interface unchanged but the function can be called from swift as oclass.classinit if no modification of the objective-c header file is possible then you can still call the function from swift as my3rdpartyclass.init as void the void return type resolves the ambiguity


52470259
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
you get an even more efficient query this query adds a convenient hyperlink to the user id. note that just the top 10 users have more than 50k post


52470387
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
i can have a post on auth that needs to be redirected to get login


52473011
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
i don t want this enum to be considered during serializable or deserialization


52474076
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
Pattern(s): 5	
to parse a string i used this but during compilation this error appears caused by the lexer.lex above error this expression has type sedlexing.lexbuf - parser.token but an expression was expected of type lexing.lexbuf - parser.token type sedlexing.lexbuf is not compatible with type lexing.lexbuf from my understanding this error appears because ocamlyacc expects the lexer to be generated by ocamllex and not by sedlex


52475927
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	5	
-webkit- - would be support browsers such as safari or google-chrome -moz- - would be supported by firefox -o- - would be supported by opera -ms- - would be supported by internet explorer browsers


52476811
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	
i m making a webextension for google-chrome and firefox that adds more information to github


52478359
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 7	
an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of it though it may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screen. the default value for this actually varies between some versions so it s better if you explicitly declare this attribute at all times


52479079
curry	first-class
Pattern(s): 7	
scala curry also makes it easier to pass around a function as a first-class


52481429
range	min	range	max	min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
a workaround for now would be to choose a range max - min that is a power of two but is larger than the range you want and then modify your component to either add a large penalty for a minimization problem to the objective value f when you are outside the desired range or raise an analysiserror can be imported from openmndao.api when you are outside the desired range


52482065
gulp-sass	node-sass
Pattern(s): 5	
i was also facing the same issue the possible solution is to install the gulp-sass module but if you will run the below command npm install -g gulp-sass or npm install --save gulp-sass this is not going to be updated on node-sass project s end


52482691
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 1	
you can check it in this answer in my scenario i am checking the error code if it is -999 then i just return from a function like following note unlike nserror of objective-c code property is not available with swift error


52484878
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
since some items may be deleted from listbox1 the counter1 needs to step from the max to min to avoid any array index issues from the counter becoming greater than the max index


52485008
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 0	
note while it would be nice to allow all screens sizes for this application it is not currently possible for devices smaller than a tablet to have a usable experience


52488016
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
http_build_query params if the request is using get but the accesstoken api must be requested as post request not get so make sure your curl call sends a post request see the second error is related to the first one because the access token is empty you get a http 400 error bad request


52489012
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
this is a shorthand rule that breaks down to flex-grow 1 flex-shrink 1 flex-basis 0 source 2019 update since the posting of this answer in 2018 it appears that google-chrome s behavior has changed and is now uniform with firefox and edge


52489527
integer	unsigned	min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
or on x86 with sse4.1 for 16-bit integer elements phminposuw _mm_minpos_epu16 can be used for min or max signed or unsigned with appropriate tweaks to the input


52491373
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
as mantissa for the double in such a case has less bits than the int then double is able to represent less digits and a loss of precision happens


52494502
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 5	
if we re talking about a safari app extension and not a legacy safari extension deprecated in safari v12 then my understanding is that the background script needs to be rewritten in swift. regarding the content scripts they are still in js but all the messaging written with google-chrome api calls must be rewritten using safari app apis


52498777
matplotlib	colormap
Pattern(s): 7	
matplotlib has many more color maps but it is not straightforward to apply these colormap to given opencv images


52500183
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
however imagesrc is not an arrays so it does not have element 0 you need to have an else statement if not so the code after the if is always executed moreover image1 imagesrc is overriding image1 whole content anyway this code should work if you want a default value for imgsrc instead you need to get it before loops array_column is not intended to be used in for-loop here you can check the manual an example using array_column edit obviously if you have more than one variants and you want them all you need a foreach on variants

update i am a little bit closer after trying out this code i get the correct data for the first day but for the second day i get all zeros the third day the max is lower than the min and so on


52522853
hive	hdfs
Pattern(s): 5	5	
you could use an hadoop platform to build a data warehouse by using mapreduce to process data and load it into orc files that will be stored in hdfs and that can be queried by hive

spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 5	
if you define your column as char 8 then it will always be padded with spaces whether the value in the file has spaces or not if i make the file have a mix with varchar2 the column value will only have spaces if the file has trailing spaces so with the same file with a mix you get varying lengths in the table if you want the column values to not have trailing spaces even if the file values do you need to trim them off if they exist create table arranger_check matriid varchar2 8 organization external type oracle_loader default directory ext_tab_data access parameters records delimiter by newline fields matriid char 8 rtrim location file.csv reject limit unlimited

super	self
Pattern(s): 5	
as patrick haugh pointed out in the comments section you could explicitly set all of the attributes of enemy at construction if you update your method to be titled __init__ self name hp skills attack defense loot expget flvrtxt alternately if you intend to instantiate specific types of bush es and imp s you might want to create them as their own classes that sub-class the enemy class but have their own default implementations for their associated fields class bush enemy def __init__ self super bush self .__init__ bush 10 none 0 5 a stick 50 just a bush it cannot attack class imp enemy def __init__ self super imp self .__init__ imp 50 none 10 10 gold 150 cliche rpg enemy this way would allow you to write code like the following to instantiate a bush that would come pre-poulated with all of the fields that you define for a bush in its class

min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
using this would result in the following - notes as is used to rename the output columns without renaming the columns they would be named max sum_score and min sum_score respectively. sql as understood by sqlite - aggregate functions this utilises the sqlite aggregate functions max and min and the group by clause to aggregate the columns according to the _id column


52574432
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 0	7	
for example using your logic with a slight change in variable names to make it clear whether you are operating on the least or most significant bits in an element you could do the following note you need to look carefully at your logic for determining cont_idx and test whether the number of bits you are replacing will span more than sizeof unsigned bytes effecting more than two elements or whether the bits to be replaced all fall within a single element -- that is left to you putting that in a short example using your test case you could do example use output

min	max	subtract	add
Pattern(s): 0	
this is a lot simpler how it works strips off the minutes and seconds from the time reducing every date to just the date and the hour finds the max consumption in that hour finds the max consumption value whose id is less than the min id in the hour the max consumption value from the previous hour subtract the max consumption this hour from the max consumption last hour to give the consumption for this hour there are other ways to skin this cat this works by join the data to itself on id id-1 gets you a this table and a previous table work out the change in consumption between successive records this.value - previous.value and then group them up by the hour same technique as above reduce the datetime to a date and add on the hour s and sum them edit modified the first query to work with your revised sample data the significant change is added a where clause to restrict the rows to just the subset day and device

google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	0	7	
threads -- threads shares a memory space it is an abstraction of the cpu it is lightweight. processes -- processes have their own memory space it is an abstraction of a computer. to parallelise task you need to abstract a cpu. however the advantages of using a process over a thread is security stability while a thread uses lesser memory than process and offers lesser latency. an example in terms of web would be google-chrome and firefox. in case of google-chrome each tab is a new process hence memory usage of google-chrome is higher than firefox while the security and stability provided is better than firefox. the security here provided by google-chrome is better since each tab is a new process different tab cannot snoop into the memory space of a given process

53140021
range	minimum	range	max	minimum	max
Pattern(s): 0	
for the case where answer is neither 1 nor max of the range +1 for this case we will need a segment tree that will give smallest missing positive value that is greater than minimum value of the range and less than maximum value of the range . we will use value 0 to represent there is no missing value for this range . for leaf node we will set missing value to 0


53142349
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
this means a for-loop over a list that is being extended within loops will iterate over the extra elements too in other cases you could use a while loops that tests a counter against the length each time while does re-evaluate the expression each iteration a while loops is more cumbersome for this task as now you have to manually maintain the counter index into your self.racks list each time and it s easy to forget or miss the at the end

for example would return 1 9 i am trying to use only recursion and want to perform this task without using other things that would make this very easy such as min max sort sorted loop..etc so far i have been able to create function that find maximum which returns 9 and a function that find minimum which is not too different which returns 1 is there a way to put this two separate functions into one using only recursion so that it would return a desired result of 1 9 any help would really be appreciated


53184132
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 7	
if your response is really big i would recommend switching to md5hex assertion tick save response as md5 hash box at the advanced tab of the http request sampler calculate md5 checksum of the file the approaches differ depending on the operating system and software you have as the majority of the world is on windows i d suggest winmd5free check out how to use jmeter assertions in three easy steps for other options and more detailed information replace response assertion with md5hex assertion and use the checksum from step 2 instead of full response the idea is that equal strings have equal hash and comparing 2 short hash is faster operation than comparing 2 big strings


53184935
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
so if you specify the text font number of lines you don t need to set fixed width and height

Pattern(s): 0	
with both boxes floated right the second box is placed on the left of first box +------------------------------------------------+ | +-----++-------+| | | red || black || | +-----++-------+| | | with widths added on the boxes the second box is pushed on a new line +------------------------------------------------+ |+----------------------------------------------+| || black || |+----------------------------------------------+| | +----------------------+| | | red || | +----------------------+| | | with negative left margin width added on second box the second box is placed next to first box +------------------------------------------------+ +----------------------++----------------------------------------------+| | red || black || +----------------------++----------------------------------------------+| | | | | | | | | a rough explanation of this behavior is that when you add a negative margin equal to greater than the width of the element it apparent width becomes 0 and browser will fit it on the same line


53186096
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
however this introduces manual memory management and this can become tricky in more complex code memory leaks double deallocations dangling pointers so a more c++ like solution would be assuming the pointers point to something more interesting than an int because now there seems to be no need for pointers


53186390
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
for instance this exception-handling won t get caught by try-catch and you will see something like this in the console log it happens because java.lang.error extends java.lang.throwable and it is not a child class of java.lang.exception

width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
simply use a base 64 encoded string to convert to from string and data so now you can construct a dictionary like then create json data on the other side once you receive json data you need to convert it back to dictionary and get the values i hope this fixes your issue but the thing is you may actually need more data than just width and height


53229691
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	5	
the empty list is inside the for-loop meaning that a new empty list is created every iteration the return is also inside the for-loop which is less than ideal you want it to be returned after loops has been exhausted and all suitable elements have been appended

free	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
another way is doing is the same. if you already know the dimension of the two arrays maybe is better to take the arguments as pointers it will look like and you will have to allocate memory this coul be done with malloc at the end of your program you will want to free that allocated memory doing free wsk

53319864
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
as stated in those answers i can not use scipy.integrate.quad to vectorize the integrals over the arrays because it employs an adaptive algorithm which is why i use numpy.trapz below i could also have used scipy.integrate.simps or scipy.integrate.romb this works fine for a single dimension but now i d like to perform a double integral replacing the c2 constant by a variable for what i could gather the only available function is scipy.integrate.dblquad bu that means i could no longer apply the integral to an entire arrays in a single pass and i would have to use a for-loop which is considerably slower

128bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 7	10	
imo you have 3 options for implementing equals hashcode use an application generated identity a uuid implement it based on a business key implement it based on the primary key using an application generated identity is the easiest approach but comes with a few downsides joins are slower when using it as pk because 128bit is simply bigger than 32 or 64bit debugging is harder because checking with your own eyes wether some data is correct is pretty hard if you can work with these downsides just use this approach

free	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
instead of this another common practice when you need a string return value instead of returning a string allocated with malloc -that would need to be released with free - you pass a local buffer that will hold the result as a parameter like this i think your code would benefit greatly if you can transform it to using this style where applicable

the frame of one cell is wider than higher kind of landscape and the other cell is higher than wider portrait


53454160
ready	each
Pattern(s): 5	
alternate design another design might consist of a more complex arrangement create a dedicated blockingcollection for each id encountered create a single dedicated long-running consumer thread for each blockingcollection each thread that processes a request acts as a producer by enqueing the request to the relevant blockingcollection the producing thread then waits in async style until a response is ready to be collected each consumer thread processes items from its blockingcollection queue in a serialised manner and signals the thread that is awaiting a response once the response is ready a disadvantage of this design is complexity a second disadvantage is that there will be overhead due to switching data between threads at least twice per request however i think that on a reasonably busy system where lots of requests are coming in this might be better at reducing the number of blocking threads

Pattern(s): 1	
i d rather not refactor the layout to not use screens have a single screens and just switching out the widgets that are not common between screens when changing nor do i want to add if this_widget_on_current_screen style logic to every property s on_change handler


53465387
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
you used here don t use because when number is greater than 0 min and max value will be set to the input number so the if and else if statement below it will not work


53467249
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 5	
the empty string is used as a delimiter between individual joined letters so they will be joined without spaces or other symbols. and i deleted all superfluous useless statements


53468509
hazelcast	terracotta
Pattern(s): 0	
in terms of implementation terracotta ehcache may be based on top of jgroups services and provides a specific set of apis specific of a caching system and so less generic than hazelcast


53468927
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
Pattern(s): 5	
and it has a parent can be retrieved using qabstractitemmodel parent qmodelindex qabstractitemmodel parent const qmodelindex index const returns the parent of the model item with the given index

int	chars
Pattern(s): 1	
i ve also tried providing different types instead of chars sticking to the ones that std hash should be able to handle automatically such as int and std string


53475655
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 5	
to compute these gradients a symbolic definition of the model is needed which requires the model to be defined using tensorflow either directly or through a high-level abstraction like keras


53478605
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 10	
see the blog post all new sites on netlify are https by default and this issue on github issue #158 disabling forced ssl even for old sites the option to turn off https or to turn off the redirect to https is no longer available


53481491
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	0	
am creating method for library with two int parameters min max method can accept only the parameters if max value is bigger than the min value on the run time means while the person is writing down the code if the parameter is not valid it shows warning before running the code because i need to get random number between both values


53484107
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 1	
the aurora it is completely different database than mysql but when it comes to the compability with mysql or postgresql amazon team did a lot so that there would not be a lot of differences


53484314

Pattern(s): 0	
use pypy as interpreter it is up 6 times quicker than cpython if it is not enough use a quicker language than python


53485326
pdfsharp	migradoc
Pattern(s): 0	
i am using migradoc because its at a higher level than pdfsharp


53485990
virtualenv	conda
Pattern(s): 10	
you can use some commands like this the caveat is that you will need to use this conda installation whenever you need to use the aws cli but its easier than messing with system-wide installations or pip configs imo and conda is more robust than a python virtualenv


53486522
ggplot2	cowplot
Pattern(s): 5	
that is this should suffice tested with ggplot2 version 3.1.0 alternatively as i mentioned in annotate outside plot area once in ggplot with facets you can make use of cowplot draw_label


53486716
backslash	double-quotes
Pattern(s): 5	
the output is a string and as such double-quotes need to be escaped with backslash


53488438
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 8	
my issue is a duplicate and the answer to my question was given by stefan-peshikj in turns out google-chrome and safari are more permissive than firefox which doesn t accept an turn url with username not accepted accepted this solves my issue


53488508
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
int is a 16-bit signed int type that can easily fit into a double which is much larger than 16 bits


53488961
fgets	fread
Pattern(s): 0	
in cases where that is practical however it will often allow better performance than using many separate calls to fread and may be nicer than using fgets


53489376
tidyverse	plyr	tidyverse	dplyr
Pattern(s): 7	
here s another approach using the tidyverse packages since dplyr has more or less supplanted plyr


53489405
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
parent params can be consumed in children but not vice versa


53489689
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
this is faster than a for-loop by creating a correlation matrix with np.newaxis in the index and then np.argwhere mask to get the mapping from the old arrays to the new


53493664
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
there are three main problems should be sum can not be used before be initialized so int division so cast either sum or numofints to be a double


53497808
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
i recently read in so that even vs2017 still seems not to support them. so for a portable solution this has to be fiddled with malloc and free btw. malloc and free are more stack-friendly than vlas because allocating on heap and i realized that a lot of people in this community are very critical concerning extensive stack usage


53499669
hide	show
Pattern(s): 5	
i know that pack and pack_forget can be used to show or hide widgets


53501759
range	max
Pattern(s): 0

53502940
pull	push	children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
what i do locally is i add in each company repository e.g product_x_company_a except for origin that has its own repo url also parent pointing to product_x repo git remote add parent if you type git remote -v you will see a list like that in this specific folder origin fetch origin push parent fetch parent push then changes being pushed to the product can be pulled from children repos locally like that git pull parent master and if everything works as expected locally - they can be pushed to specific clients repo like that git push origin master you don t usually need to commit something as you are passing commits from one repo to the other basically


53503442
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
i ve got a problem with my program a bit here is the the code the problem is in the file i ve got parent who have more than 1 children example mary- patricia mary- lisa but when i call children_and_parents mary .child i get only lisa but i should get patricia and lisa also i would like them to be different entities so i can call and use them later on

versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
after that the oracle patch 19692824 dbcontrol is not coming up on oel 7 must be installed to upgrade the versioning of oem agent


53505174
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 1	
if you read the advanced integrations section they suggest doing this adds an event listener for the load event on the script element that loads stripe and sets the state when it is available so no continuous polling with setinterval settimeout is needed


53506100
ubuntu	debian
Pattern(s): 7	
can anyone help me to clear my doubts - why debian os takes less time for context switching although ubuntu is based on debian kernel


53507662
lxml	elementtree
Pattern(s): 7	
updated to be well-formed python output if you re able to use lxml it has much better xpath support than elementtree


53507862
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
proceed with caution consider using the rectify function running the rectify function throws the following error error in .intersectextent x y validate true objects do not intersect in addition warning messages 1 in .local x ... min y larger than max y 2 in .local x ... min y larger than max y and when rectifying just one layer in the raster stack like so generates the following error error in validitymethod object invalid extent ymin ymax i can t tell what s wrong


53509409
hide	show
Pattern(s): 5	
instead handle it in one event handler only like this edit additional logic will be needed to show hide the text below but that should be simple enough


53515062
memcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 5	
this happens as a result of that std is_trivial which is used in stl to determine if a class can be copied via memmove memcpy or resort to a loop

versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
the previously installed packages will be downgraded upgrade to the new versioning


53520228
sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 1	
for me logging in was as simple as sudo mysql -u root don t forget the sudo i really hope there should have been a message stating that ubuntu no longer used passwd when attempting to run mysql


53521035
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
included name you might not need to pad the id or salary so much come of the casts to chars on flag columns can be dropped if the flag column is 100 guaranteed to always be 1 chars long if salary max value in table is larger than an int can hold consider a cast to something else by padding the salary with leading zeroes the sort will work out


53521638
soundjs	preloadjs
Pattern(s): 5	
preloadjs is really only designed to load webaudio sounds to be played with soundjs


53521638
createjs	preloadjs	createjs	soundjs	soundjs	preloadjs
Pattern(s): 7	
as a maintainer of the createjs libraries i am certainly biased but if you want to preload audio with preloadjs then soundjs is a better option than howler


53522625
pexpect	subprocess
Pattern(s): 5	
it seemed it was way to tricky to be handled with subprocess and hence i had to pexpect to solve this and it worked in first go


53522806
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the long contour is considered a line if its width is much longer than its height or its aspect ratio is large such as 8 and you need also to optimize this value finally you should get something like that


53523668
dplyr	tidyr
Pattern(s): 1	
a very inelegant solution with dplyr and tidyr which someone can probably build on update


53525328
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 7	
if you read the travis log you can see project name missing project description missing project url missing license information missing scm url missing developer information missing invalid pom.xml io reactivex rxjava2 rxjavafx 2.11.0-rc31 rxjavafx-2.11.0-rc31.pom project name missing project description missing project url missing license information missing scm url missing developer information missing missing no javadoc jar found in folder maven central has many more requirements than bintray i suggest you look through the minimum requirements here


53526459
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
chars has size of 1 byte and int has bigger size depending on platform 4 bytes most of the times


53526459
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
int is in your case probably 4 times bigger than chars resulting in looping over whole of your data structure of type chars 4 times quicker as you expected


53526523
inline-functions	inlining
Pattern(s): 5	
note the intent is that an inline-functions that is the subject of an explicit instantiation declaration will still be implicitly instantiated when odr-used 3.2 so that the body can be considered for inlining but that no out-of-line copy of the inline-functions would be generated in the translation unit. end note 14.7.3 a declaration of a function template class template or variable template being explicitly specialized shall precede the declaration of the explicit specialization


53530625
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	0	
in a max-heap the parent is greater than the children


53530625
children	parent

we can have a new type of heap where the parent is in the middle of the children - the left child is smaller than the parent and the right child is greater than the parent


53531380
mouseup	mousedown
Pattern(s): 7	
the zoom is ignored if the elapse time between mousedown and mouseup is less than the double click time


53535290
textview	imageview	width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
imageview will automatically resize based on height of the textview and wrap of the width


53536743
apache	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 7	
you would then ensure that apache or maybe lighttpd which is lighter weight is running on your rpi


53539983
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
and the artwork image it self can not be bigger than height or width 100 of the grid-item max-width 100


53541705
min	max
Pattern(s): 1	
i started by using a bootstrap template and could quite easily generate fields with min max values etc now i would like to setup input elements that could hold only numbers and also would persist to use a certain variable amount of decimals


53545862
sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 7	
the first solution likely will be faster with smaller list of dicts since the sorting is easier but you would need to test that. it is not required in the solution that i gave that the keys be grouping it is required for groupby to work


53546300
seaborn	matplotlib
Pattern(s): 0	
so i would recommend either using matplotlib 1.5 together with seaborn 0.7 or matplotlib 2.2.3 or higher together with seaborn 0.9


53549363
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
for example it can be done using loops consider the last dictionary since dataframe is expected to be pretty large and it may have many columns to select on i am looking for the efficient way to solve the problem without using for-loop to iterate the dataframe


53554954
textview	imageview	width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
the textview with id recomm_prdct_itemdesc cannot have the height set to matchconstraint as it does not have a reference view to match its constraint like the width which can be matched to imageview with id recomm_prdct_img


53557232
react-native-router-flux	react-navigation
Pattern(s): 0	
react-native-router-flux is a wrapper over react-navigation it is really simple to use and allows you to write a lot less code than with react-navigation however if you want to implement complex features it might not be the best choice


53557308
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
in your case it s int because chars can be implicitly be converted to int easily but not always the other way around


53559173
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 5	
i did it to support the postgresql jsonb datatype something similar could be made for mysql


53560991
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	
this works perfectly well in firefox but google-chrome never downloads more than 10 files


53561543
equals	tostring	tostring	getter	getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
i would argue that every bit of code should be covered including getter and setter tostring equals and hash code


53564454
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
Pattern(s): 7	0	
imagemagick has many more features than graphicsmagick but may be slightly slower


53565160
fgets	fgetc
Pattern(s): 5	
to read a whole file into an array of pointers to char which represent the lines you can do using only a fixed-size two-dimensional array and fgetc could be done with fgets too


53565564
mayavi	matplotlib
Pattern(s): 10	
if you want to stick to python then you can use mayavi which is faster compared to matplotlib


53565858
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
there is also a page called data type precedence transact-sql documenting what type would be implicitly converted to what type when the implicit conversion is a result of a calculation - for example - 1 + 2 would result with 3 since int has a higher precedence than chars result implicitconversiondemo 3


53569224
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
it will be called server-side once on the first request to the nuxt app and client-side when navigating to further routes

biginteger cannot be converted to int error incompatible types stringbuilder cannot be converted to chars c sb.append c


53571019
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 5	
i know what i could save the variable value to a temp file but i am trying to do this without creating intermediary files i still have two stream that could be used stderr and stdout


53571533
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 0	
however it s my experience that gradle is not slower or faster than either maven or ant


53572537
glfw	glew
Pattern(s): 5	
glew must be included before glfw


53572570
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 5	
use something that ll always cover every other option like or as swordfish commented you can flip the bits of an unsigned integer literal to answer your comment you can explicitly tell the compiler what type you want your enum to have enum eventtype unsigned int


53574519
std	ostream
Pattern(s): 1	
the downside is that the only place it prints its output is standard output you may send an std ostream object and use it instead of std cout converting an int to an std string is very conveniently possible with std to_string


53578538
oncreate	ondestroy
Pattern(s): 5	5	
since we have multiple schemas for various data objects i want to make my code cleaner by using something like this activities and fragments can inherit from realmowner and implement the mandatory realmcontainer using lifecyclerealmcontainer and passing their lifecycle into it then - the initrealm would be called with oncreate and closerealm would be called with ondestroy


53579067
memcpy	strcpy
Pattern(s): 10	
note that i deliberately did not use strcpy because if length is known memcpy is more efficient and if not known strcpy is unsafe risking undefined behaviour due to writing beyond target array bounds


53579516
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
a hacky solution that worked for me if m2e is complaining that the following jar is not found in the maven cache you can find the bad path in the error log for the pom.xml file or in the java build path maven dependencies list then try the following command fill in java_version_here for an installed jdk jdk1.8.0_191-amd64 then use the two path sections after .m2 repository above to determine the correct groupid and replace 1.6 with whatever version m2e is complaining about -- it may or may not matter if the jdk you have installed matches the version m2e is complaining about this command copies tools.jar from your jdk and puts it into the maven cache also creating a pom.xml file for it so that it can be used by maven


53582185
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i am guessing that count distinct is a better approach than union in the subquery but you could test that


53582346
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	7	
there are applications where maintaining the necessary data integrity using an external database sqlite mysql postgresql makes more sense


53583647

i am trying to create a python script where the user can type in their fasta file and that file will then be parsed using biopython


53585376
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 0	
limited ram where your working set is significantly bigger than ram and slow disk can contribute to slow queries


53586061
oncreate	findviewbyid
Pattern(s): 5	
edit and inside your toolbar xml node add the id attribute with value toolbar as called in oncreate callback since the view with toolbar as id could not be found findviewbyid returns null and setsupportactionbar will get a null value that means no toolbar to cast as actionbar


53586260
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
try this one - problems with your query - you are trying to insert more than 10 chars in course increase the size to 20 you are using int for timeofupdate and inserting a string value - change the type to datetime username should be a string

53597155
verilog	vhdl
Pattern(s): 7	
vhdl needs more code to describe a program but it often catches errors missed by verilog emphasizes unambiguous semantics and is portable just to name a few


53599166
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 0	
to make it easier than a for-loop you could use .map to create a new arrays from the old one by transforming each object


53599235
subtract	add
Pattern(s): 0	
to achieve expected result use below option do another check for end date checking if greater than 28 add and subtract days based on that condition codepen -


53604929
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 3	
i prefer having setter getter


53605347
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
since you have initialize a git repo using git init in a parent folder automatically all the subfolders children will be added to the repository and can be controlled from parent folder


53606328
int	chars
Pattern(s): 8	
500-599 for errors rejections i prefer this to simple int and while it can be less descriptive than chars it can also be less ambiguous


53606554
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
as you mentioned in your question geckodriver firefox combination is faster then chromedriver google-chrome at this point it is worth to mention that diferent browsers render the html dom in a different way


53607942
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if you try to start a thread when the number of active threads is less than max and greater than min you ll see a 2 second delay. so i ve prepared a sample code to test it threadpool.getminthreads returns 8 for my machine and i run the code on my local machine


53607942
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if you try to start a thread when the number of active threads is less than max and greater than min you ll see a 2 second delay


53608827
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
but the height of cells is bigger than their width


53613333
median	minimum
Pattern(s): 10	
that is because we have the same amount of elements at both side but the median value is closer to the minimum thus there should be elements with smaller difference between them


53614027
width	height	portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 0	0	0	
with regard to aspect ratio the general accepted terms are landscape an element with a width greater than height portrait an element with a height greater than width square an element with equal height and width react native implements aspectratio as a non-standard property of nodes not of viewport defined as a number allowing locking the ratio between width and height in place


53614027
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	0	
an aspectratio value of 2 will attempt to size the node with having a height two times smaller than the width and a value of .2 will result in a node having a height 5 times bigger than the width


53614137
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
which i see you re already doing but you can do it a little cleaner using an istream_iterator as far as evaluating out of range you can easily evaluate if there are any elements less than minimum using any_of and either a lambda or a bind statement for example live example


53616511
ssl	https
Pattern(s): 5	
i m doing a web application where i need to use websockets and for that i use the socket.io library in local everything works correctly but when it comes to uploading to my vps with windows server 2012 it does not work i got the following error so i opened port 8082 from the windows firewall but this port is for protocol communication http and according to the socket.io library i need the communication to be done through https protocol since if i try to access through this port i get the following error my server is from godaddy and i already have ssl certificate i would like to know how i can open a port that communicates by https protocol since before i tried my application on a test server called www.c9.io and it works correctly because on this server the ports are already configured to be accessed by the url with the http protocol and https protocol both i appreciate your help i do not really know much about ports and servers it s my first vps thank you very much


53618332
int	double
Pattern(s): 10	8	
int is more specific than double because there s an implicit conversion from int to double but no conversion from double to int


53620339
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 5	
so your second example represents this data obs id name value 1 1 blah 100 2 2 has spaces 200 3 3 ends with quotes 300 4 4 surrounded with quotes 300 if you want to represent it as a delimiter file where none of the values are allowed to contain the delimiter in other words not as a standard csv file than it would look like id name value 1 blah 100 2 has spaces 200 3 ends with quotes 300 4 surrounded with quotes 300 but if you want to allow the values to contain the delimiter then you need some way to distinguish embedded delimiter from real delimiter


53620629
width	height

sudo	passwd
Pattern(s): 7	
and of course add the username and passwd that you already created on postgres if you don t have an user you can create one like this sudo -u postgres createuser -s dev sudo -u postgres psql passwd dev #here you can type the passwd you want for this user q in this example we are creating a user named dev so you add dev to the username part and change the passwd for the one you typed


53622569

the command always produces the following output which i would like to suppress generating a 2048 bit rsa private key ............................................. .............................................................+++ ........................................+++ writing new private key to . private.key i already tried to redirect the output with any variants of but his doesn t work in this scenario because of these reasons the openssl command is executed within a powershell session like this again the redirection of the powershell streams doesn t work either. this wouldn t be a problem at all but if your run the command in a non interactive mode the openssl output will be send to stderr and not to stdout


54041247
crypt	hash
Pattern(s): 5	
you can assign the result of crypt 3 to a and reference the hash from the pointer since crypt 3 has its own static data space it will rewrite on every call to it you may want to copy the hash to your program s space using a char array and strcpy 3 or more tersely in this way hash won t be overwritten when crypt 3 is called again

54063403
orchestration	microservices	stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 7	
advantages 1.decentralized and decoupled architecture using choreography rather than orchestration makes services publish-subscribe based and as a result fully decentralized 2.do one thing and do it well unix philosophy more focused and singular with very narrow functionality 3.easy to have parallelism and load balancing because of being more fine-grained from the business process point of view 4.statelessness however having a stateful microservices is valid but it is not the ideal 5.individual data storage makes services relaxed to keep tracing the data-flow 6.easy and automated deployment and discovery due to use of container engine-based technologies such as docker 7.more interoperability which makes services able to have more flexibility in accepting dropping a new current service or protocol 8.fully compatible with representational state transfer rest which allows creating stateless services 9.suitable for discrete systems for example for batch automation process disadvantages 1.service synchronization keeping services synchronized in a cooperative way 2.difficult to find systematic problems for example finding a problem in a chain of business activities when there is a logical error in the process is more difficult and it requires to combine several log files into one piece 3.automated deployment and discovery is a must when the number of microservices is more than a few 4.difficult to find the right service granularity which can lead the entire system into instability due to overwhelmed network communication and error rations 5.challenging when the business system is not discrete enough like continues process control 6.developing an automated test is significant difficult than monolithic systems following are a set of articles that published about microservices in code-project you can read and comment on your questions if you like


54064036
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
the problem appears only if the height is bigger then the width this increases the number of limits for the width from 2 to 3 width must be less or equal than 1280 don t exceed width width must be less or equal than initial width don t upscale width must be less or equal than 1280 width height don t exceed height to test for all cases you would use creating a filter of edit in some versions of ffmpeg the line above will not work citing self-referencing issues


54064036
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	0	
in this case we can create an alternative line of thought if the width is bigger than or equal to the height we scale by width using min iw 1280 if the height is bigger than the width we scale by height using min ih 1280 the expression would then be don t forget that you might run this through some shell parsing mechanism which would additionally create the need to escape the commas


54066935
division	subtraction
Pattern(s): 10	
if you re on an embedded cpu where division is more expensive you can accomplish exactly the same thing like this the total amount added to accum here is just like the first example but the division is replaced with an incremental repeated subtraction

54095072
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	5	
i would drop the idea of absolute content if its not necesarry and try something similiar to where you basically make every container a flex and the non scalable part of its content will have fix width height and the other part get flex 1 which is shorthand for taking rest of the space


54096266
queue	fifo
Pattern(s): 5	
even if b1 was picked up immediately after a1 failed you d have to wait to consume a2 until a1 was consumed in order to preserve order and since the queue must be consumed fifo that would block the consumption of c1 and any of the other messages behind it

and for what it s worth when you re iterating over an arrays a for-loop is a better fit because it allows you to define the iteration variable the condition and the increment all in one place


54209428
temp	junction
Pattern(s): 10	
it was explicitly typed as an integer in the code i saw so presumably it s central to ensuring the algorithm works. didn t change. became didn t change. became this time the condition containing the junction reads in english as if temp is less than or equal to both acu and acu times value


54209853
distance	altitude
Pattern(s): 7	10	
however if i put all the flight records together the dataset contains many airlines so the flight distance vary from each other the fuel cost positively changed with the altitude because usually the longer the flight distance is the higher a plane would fly and a longer flight distance always means more fuel cost

Pattern(s): 5	
float therefore to initialize a float variable use the suffix f or f as in the following example double however if you want an int number to be treated as double use the suffix d or d for example decimal if you want a numeric real literal to be treated as decimal use the suffix m or m for example my advice you should really determine which type you ll actually be needing to use prior to using it


54221213
prop	each
Pattern(s): 5

54234835
pandas	dask
Pattern(s): 1	
looking through dask documentation it says there that generally speaking dask.dataframe groupby-aggregations are roughly same performance as pandas groupby-aggregations. so unless you re using a dask distributed client to manage workers threads etc. the benefit from using it over vanilla pandas isn t always there


54238613
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 0

Pattern(s): 5	
a for-loop has three parts an initialization a condition and a block to be executed after loops


54247418
width	height
Pattern(s): 7

54262141
super	self
Pattern(s): 5	
i can t really figure out why either. if the concern is double-initialization the swift compiler knows if when and where i call designated super or self initializers so it knows whether i m done initializing this instance. if the concern is that i haven t yet called a designated initializer then it should be fine because i d just be making this instance a reference to the other one 2 vars 1 pointer . if the concern is that concurrent access might have caused self to already be initialized.


54263324
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
i couldn t figure out on how to pass variables with type string in swift controller files and pass it to object written in objective-c


54265214
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
i have also checked to see the contents of the _post array in the 2nd file to see if i am receiving data in a format other than a post request like a string that might have to be exploded to get the contents but the _post array comes up empty. this is the output i get when it redirects to the 2nd page array array the _post and _get for testing purpose arrays come up empty

multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	division	division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	10	
this seems a better solution as multiplication is much faster than division better accuracy as multiplying with a power-of-2 number is exact so i d like to create a small utility function which has a logic like this by i mean exponentiation this function should return a normalized scaler scalerreciprocal both are power-of-2 numbers where scaler is near to value and scalerreciprocal is the reciprocal of scaler


54299908
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
just like properties can have explicit getter and setter events can have explicit add and remove handlers there s no way an outside class can directly access the underlying onaction3 field through the onaction3 event just as you cannot directly access the onaction2 field through the onaction2 property

54320786
raft	paxos
Pattern(s): 0	
this behavior is why tcp exists because each individual packet can go through separate routes between servers and there is a high chance of out-of-order messages and most applications prefer the ease-of-mind of a strict ordering. other protocols such as plain old paxos can work with out-of-order messages but are typically much slower than raft


54321577
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
however i know this can be solved by try-catch ing the exception-handling and moderating what to throw in that matter but that would involve a lot of code

i tried mew for markeredgewidth keyword to remove them as it would be used in matplotlib but that is an unknown property for seaborn


54342051
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
when the height of element is smaller we can align but when the height is bigger and reach the minimum defined by the parent there is nothing to align and the overal height of the parent may increase if we keep increasing the height of childs you may also note that you are applying width 100 on the a which will have no effect on inline element but will apply to inline-block making each element to be placed on a different line


54344306
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
the instance created in parent component can be shared with children component


54349191

this can be achieved with show and hide events where we can validate the tooltip text and show or hide the tooltip as below and works for me


54397812
ready	each
Pattern(s): 5	
you got the whole categories combined together because your output array is defined out of the loop and it will be filled during each loop iteration. to fill it with only single category create it inside the loop so at the next iteration it will be empty array ready to be filled with new data the json output will be something like this


54399126
rank	percentile

54400198
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
getting the width is doable by subtracting the scrollbar width from the available screen width getting the height is slightly more complicated because we need to take into account the browser ui tabs address bar bookmarks so far this seems to work until .


54402814
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
chars 0 s binary representation occupies 16 bit 0000 0000 0011 0000 while int 0 s binary representation occupies 32 bit 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 when you sum a chars and an int the chars will be promoted to int first


54402814
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
chars 5 s unicode is 0035 in binary 0000 0000 0011 0101 it will be promoted to int by inserting 16 zeros at head 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 0101 and the int represents 53 in decimal


54405300

the only solution i found edit similar to this one was to import in my framework s umbrella header every objective-c header that should be exposed to swift and then make these headers public


54405607
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
if the browser s width is bigger than the image s original width the image s width and height should be enlarged proportionally together with its container - thus pushing downwards the page s contents that appear under the image


54408111
min	max
Pattern(s): 7	
this is a pretty straight forward piece of code so you need to find what logic get the max in that which is this logic now how can you make it the min well is greater and is less so would do the trick kind of there is a bug but is confusing because you call the var max personally i would re-write like this


54410251
division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
in follow-up to phuclv comment i checked the code generated by jit 1 the results are as follows for variable 5000 division by constant for variable variable because division always takes longer than multiplication the last code snippet is less performant


54410675

public	protected
Pattern(s): 1	
i would like to present you with some arguments protecting protected fields in java you may favor accessing base class members using protected fields over public accessors in situation where you need to avoid value validation . however if this is not the case then private fields with public accessors should be used to compliment hermetization


54423623

54429513
width	height	width	border-color	border-color	height	border-color	background-color
Pattern(s): 5	
most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be unless the jquery.color plugin is used and also considering that the shorthand css properties font background border are not fully supported. you need a plugin to make the border color transition the border-color property is ignored by .animate method. for example try this 2.7kb minified


54434904
persistent	transient
Pattern(s): 5	
specification says variables may be marked transient to indicate that they are not part of the persistent state of an object so if you really want to go by the book you should not write them

54446590
printf	strcpy	strcpy	malloc
Pattern(s): 5	
the value of output is unchanged by concatena so you print an uninitialized char crash or any other undefined behavior you need to make output an output var so etc like that i also fixed your malloc you missed 1 char for the null terminator warning if output is not set and you still print it not initialized you need to set it to null and test that case before to printf it or more probably to replace by else this is what i did above note also dim_input1 and dim_input2 have the same value it is useless to distinguishes them and the first call of copy_string can be replaced by strcpy and the second by strcat except that copy_string miss to add a final null character

you can get the image name from its src attribute which can be obtained using attr


54530689
jruby	mri
Pattern(s): 5	
this is mostly a concern when processing requests is computationally heavy - which is something to avoid - if a request needs to perform some heavy computation it s a good idea to move it a background job using a library like can t be used on jruby since it does not support forking threads the configured amount of threads will be run for each worker process - meaning if you have workers x and threads y then you are getting a total of request processing threads share memory so they have smaller memory footprint even though there are gotchas here as well on mri which is the default ruby implementation threads do not allow for executing ruby code in parallel due to the gil - this should not be a big concern as the gil is not locked during waiting on io which is where a lot of the execution time will be spent - accessing the database communicating with apis etc

Pattern(s): 7	
whereas in python a for-loop is more of a for each loops - you give it an iterable object and it runs the code for every item in that iterable object


54544226
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
the conda documentation explicitly mentions this issue in their troubleshooting documentation conda upgrade error cause downgrading conda from 4.6.1 to 4.5.x and then trying to conda install conda or conda upgrade conda will produce a solving and upgrade error similar to the following solving environment failed condaupgradeerror this environment has previously been operated on by a conda versioning that s newer than the conda currently being used

however i still not satisfied with the workaround approach and invite more simple and straight approach to solve the proble m consisting txt file with comma spaces and semicolons while semicolon is to be treated as delimiter try this is the result input output


54547173
waitpid	fork
Pattern(s): 5	
finally as you do a waitpid it is not necessary to retain the child pid and call waitpid you can simply call wait 2 as you only create a single child and you can trust that wait 2 will give an error if the child finally could not be created the fork call didn t succeed also returnstatus is composed of more info than just the exit 2 value from the child process so comparing it with 0 is not the proper way to check how did it go in the child


54548439
stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 10	
an architecture that makes sense in flutter is as follows a top-level stateful widget stateful works better for hot reload a stateless one can cause issues something like myapp but change my to the name of the actual app


54548601
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
it s because you bind ellipse width to the actualheight and since your window isn t square but wide rectangle height value is bigger than width so is not enough wide place to fit square


54549072
division	multiplication	division	addition	addition	multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition


54551715
instances	transient
Pattern(s): 5	
in a case you need different instances for different cases - you can create a singleton wrapper which will contain all required instances with correspondent name irepository will be registered as transient but wrapper as singleton whenever you need one of those instances you will inject a wrapper as a dependency and use required instances through well-named property because di need to know how to instantiate different instances of same class we need to create some workaround


54552512
rspec	minitest
Pattern(s): 7	
i find rspec s syntax and support for all the different tests model view controller feature helper services etc very clear and easy to implement also mocking and stubbing is relatively trivial compared to minitest and also rspec has a large fanbase from the rails community.but when building a gem i advice using minitest since it s the official test suite but in testing large and complex codes rspec makes it easier imo


54552560

get put are of o 1 concurrentskiplistmap more operations than just get put like sorted top bottom n items by key get last entry fetch traverse whole map sorted by key etc


54555242
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 5	
as an addition if the output would have gone to stderr whats not the case here you would still see it in the terminal because the pipe | only redirects stdout if you don t specify otherwise the rest goes unfiltered to the terminal


54555545
jobs	cron	pull	push
Pattern(s): 0	
the ugly the simplest way to do it for the schedule is to put the following in your jenkinsfile in blueocean every branch and every pull request counts as its own job -- so if you follow standard git workflow the above code will create no less than three cron jobs the feature branch you push even though it hasn t been merged the pull request branch whether or not you merge it the master branch if when you merge the feature branch there is no way to undo this damage unless you push more commits to the feature branch and keep the pull request open under the same number -- otherwise you will be configuring a different job than the one with the cron script


54556481
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
you need to have a variable max and for every word inputted check if it s greater than the max then change the max to the new word and same for the min don t forget to check if min is still then change it to first word also you need a counter to count the length of all words inputted and a counter for the number of words that has been inputted to calculate average word length in the end and to output them as string 1 hey string 2 hello world etc.. you need to do like this

maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 5	
maven expects every dependency to be listed with maven coordinates groupid artifactid version in the pom.xml


54557453
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
after further testing i realized any double that i cast to an int that is greater than integer.max_value just makes the int equal to integer.max_value. for example after further testing i realized if you try to cast a long to an int it seems to assign the int to a seemingly random number


54560853

Pattern(s): 5	
since your dictionary key is a string string.gethashcode is o n depending on the length of the string and dictionary perf can be hurt by hash-collision


54579732
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
there is never never any reason whatsoever to square-bracket an int literal it s nothing more than a rather roundabout way to turn an int literal into a double since worksheet numeric values are variant double which is much better off done with an explicit conversion debug.print typename cdbl 42 double ...or even with a gasp type hint debug.print typename 42# double


54582293

centos	linux	installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
b. the virtualbox versioning runs on osx as well with virtualbox installed there whereas there was never an official ise versioning for osx macos - but you need to run the installation after download on a windows machine first - and then transfer the virtualdisk to osx - c. the virtualbox ise for win10 is made for spartan6 only - it looks like there are spartan3 files too but if you start making a project then you will see lots of files are missing for spartan3 - but you can create a tar file from ise_ds ise spartan3 from the native package and restore it in the virtualbox - and xilinx said that the virtualbox has some spartan6 files which the native package doesn t have - same here - use tar to transfer between environments - d. unfortunately oracle linux 6 has some older tools such as gcc binutils etc - in most cases that does not matter - but some fpga projects like walter s pdp11 70 require uptodate tools - in this case check out the oracle linux rhel centos 6 to 7 inplace upgrade path - the xilinx license which comes with the virtualbox is tied to the ethernet address - whereas for the native versioning we need to get a license at xilinx website with your personal log in e. some people have problems on win10 with the programming devices driver not working depending on your hardware digilent adept might be an alternative f. the virtual box has host-only network after install - but you can easily change settings to share host s network connection and reach the internet to clone from github or get updates i hope this helps a bit for orientation - after transferring the missing spartan3 files from the native package into my virtual box i run 97 of my projects on win10 or osx using the virtualbox ise - which i upgrade to ol 7.6 ymmv


54602094
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


54602094
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	7	0	
it s complex but basically long has a higher rank than int and int has a higher rank than chars


54602095
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 0	
the integer promotions are if a type is wider 1 than unsigned int it is not changed


54603124
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 5	
this is too big for a 16 bit int but not a 16 bit unsigned int so each is multiplied by 1u to force the values to be converted to unsigned int as per the usual arithmetic conversions specified in section 6.3.1.8 the integer promotions are performed on both operands


54603124
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


54608344
inherited	subclassing
Pattern(s): 5	
because it s impossible to analyze all the subclassing the base class is fragile in the sense that any change in it may lead to unexpected changes of behavior in subclasses. to protect against this problem effective java by joshua bloch addison-wesley 2008 one of the best-known books on good java programming style recommends that you design and document for inherited or else prohibit it. this means all classes and methods that aren t specifically intended to be overridden in subclassing need to be explicitly marked as final . kotlin follows the same philosophy

you might get better results with dateadd datepart number date


54611944
min	max	minimum	max
Pattern(s): 7	
here is one of the correct ways for calculating the bounding box based on his answer this way you ensure the minimum is always lower than the maximum you can also change things when you re querying based on min and max but i figured this is simpler


54612789
hash	md5

54615876
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
well this while loops is slower because more happens you check two conditions every time you iterate and inside the while block you index a list you do the same check as in the for-loop and you add 1 to i


54617629
google-chrome	firefox

width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
personally i d go for area size now that you ve defined your comparer your linq is easy give me the name of the smallest paper that is larger than this width and height when concatening linq statements always make sure that only the last statement is the one that does not return ienumerable


54633748
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
and there is no need for your range loops there is a more elegant way to do this in python use a for-loop over all elements of the list


54637328
min	max

int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
it appears null can be used for int data types but not double


54639858
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
the apply functions are generally faster than loops and i think you want to use a for-loop not a while loops here anyway


54640007
pull	push
Pattern(s): 10	
with pull it is less repetitive to use the saved remote and the remote can be tracked by your git client to check if pull or push is needed


54640291
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	5	
if as indicated in your comment to this answer this needs to be modified server-side input#destinations needs to be filled out server-side than simply include that input in the partial-view and read it from there and ignore the code that modifies it client-side


54642021

Pattern(s): 0	
anything more than 2 chars alphabets and i start getting confused by turning it into an int then converting that into a hex value


54642546

or you can add a few dummy items.so they can be view with width and height of your normal items.that should do it


54699764
super	self
Pattern(s): 5	
but since you defined __init__ in child you have to call parent __init__ method as well for that else parent constructor isn t called prints moritz mustermann to call the parent __init__ method we used parent.__init__ self we could also have used super like this super child self .__init__ which amounts to the same thing here single inheritance so even like super .__init__

54713837
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
i ve attempted to change the field to a string input but i have so many calls to those entered fields that would need to be cast to int that it would seem to me to be far easier if i was able to change the maximum allowable chars in that field to 13

54734661
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
similarly casting it to int32_t or uint32_t will result in a sign-extension from signed chars to the 32-bit wide value 0xffffffff if you cast to unsigned chars like in instead then the unsigned chars 0xff will be promoted to int using zero extension 4 therefore the result will be exactly the same as in summary when in doubt consult the standard


54736546
spaces	delimiter
Pattern(s): 0	
first i thought i may use delim_whitespace true in read_csv method this helps when you have more than one spaces as delimiter


54738780
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
in a recent project with drf v3.9.1 and django 2.1 i needed to recursively expose all the children of an object by having only a direct connection to the parent which could have had multiple children


54741951
g++	gcc
Pattern(s): 5	
i assume the error you get looks something like this and so on. c++ programs which use the standard library so most of them need to be linked using g++ not gcc


54745878
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
if your gerrit versioning is older than 2.11.11 you will need to upgrade it to make replication to github work again


54747421
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
the difference between array.map and a for-loop is that the for-loop does nothing more than iterating over the values of the arrays


54748001
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
i have the following app delegate in objective-c .h file where the app controller is written in swift objective-c xyapplicationcontroller class applicationcontroller nsobject if i try to use this in an extension in swift have no idea why and how to fix it but it seems to be related to swift objective-c swift

google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
are there good reasons why the request can t be processed by google-chrome and firefox


54759740
prometheus	metrics
Pattern(s): 5	
the right way to look at pushgateway imho is like yet another scraping endpoint . this means that it will not aggregate the metrics you pushing and will just hold them as-is . but you actually do not need it to be aggregated - prometheus will scrape the data from pushgateway and all your data will be available in the prometheus


54762223
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
should be declare in for-loop and adapter is outside of loops


54766075
lxml	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 2	
i normally prefer beautifulsoup with lxml parser for parsing xml. sample code below output you can then use the methods provided by beautifulsoup like find and find_all to find the corresponding node or subnodes


54768472
disk	ram
Pattern(s): 5	
queries that hit tables that have not been read before will cause data to be read from disk while tables that are already pre-loaded to page cache will be much faster as they are fetched from ram


54769435
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 7	
a simple query which i can t get my head around sample dataset ach_date code 1 31oct2018 a81001 2 31jan2019 a81001 3 31oct2018 a81002 4 31jan2019 a81002 5 31oct2018 a81003 6 31jan2019 a81004 i want to group_by on the code variable and filtering on ach_date whereby if a grouping has more than one row remove the row where

post	put
Pattern(s): 10	8	
this infosec answer says that for updates post is more correct than put but from a security point of view it doesn t matter because the call will be called in https


54770231
super	self
Pattern(s): 5	
so in e.foo super .foo can be read as super e self .foo


54774742
children	parent

54777729
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 5	
if your union share a common property with distinct values you can use discriminated union like mateuszkocz suggests


54781481
post	put	post	get	put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
from what i can see there are 2 problems with your app.api.call you got the first argument wrong it should never be get but instead it should be read for get requests update for put requests delete for delete requests and create for post requests


54788957
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the function could be defined as int calculate int a chars op int b with your calculation a op1 b op2 c you would first have to check the precedence of the operators op1 and op2 to decide if you calculate a op1 b op2 c or a op1 b op2 c


54788957
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
the function could be defined as int precedence chars op then you could do something like this in the program from the question you might want to use instead of return calculate .


54790541
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
Pattern(s): 0	
well the answer is that if you are going to load the sortedlist up-front the insertions will be slower but because array indexing is faster than following object links lookups are marginally faster than a sorteddictionary

Pattern(s): 5	
if your dependency properties can be set by inherited and you care about that you can check


54802304
countif	sumifs
Pattern(s): 0	
if column a is sorted then you could also use copied down this would be faster than using countif within the same formula referring to error 1004 s answer countif and sumifs all need to look at the range so having two of these in the same formula will consume twice as much resources but it has the advantage that it doesn t require column a to be sorted


54806520

54808749
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 1	
this is my script this gives me an error error in function classes fdef mtable unable to find an inherited method for function extract for signature matrix data.frame if i replace with it gives me the error error in for i in x invalid for-loop sequence if i write and change the start of loops to it gives me the error error in z i invalid subscript type s4 i m not very familiar with loops function so i m not sure why it s giving me these errors

54814177
post	put
Pattern(s): 5	
userrepository.save user the update user operation is almost the same i m surprised that the user s openid attribute will be changed after post and then put the returned user object will have the changed value. user.getopenid 2 it looks like readonlyproperty not working i m using the release version of spring-boot-starter-data-jpa


54816340
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 10	
the abstract_class properties is more or less a way to subclassing models without invoking sti single table inherited


54817847
tensorflow	tensorboard
Pattern(s): 10	
in general i think tensorboard is much more suited for monitoring rather than analysis as the primary goal of tensorboard is to make it easier to understand debug and optimize tensorflow programs


54820262
mp3	flac
Pattern(s): 5	
gstreamer instead of the function used for simulating the mic-phone audio for this program i have created pipelines which are the audio file can be changed to flac or mp3 with changing appropriate elemnets in pipeline the process of taking payloads from rtp stream and writing it on file is done in another thread than sending the data to google and reading the response


54827168
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
however i read insomniac games style guide that int should be preferred for-loop counters you should rather be using size_t whenever iterating over an arrays


54827376
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
i just started to learn dart and came across the below code it produces the below output true true false i am not sure why the above output is generated. the above output suggests that all int can be treated as double


54834666

virtualenv	conda
Pattern(s): 5	
this is what i do activate your conda virutal env use pip to install into your virtualenv if you face any compatibility issues use conda i recently ran into this when numpy matplotlib freaked out and i used the conda build to resolve the issue


54837048
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
arrays however are special in that they essentially compile into a range-based for-loop which is much faster than using an ienumerable


54837065
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 10	
ffmpeg being built as a command line tool that can take it s input from stdin and output to stdout stderr it is more simple to use these capabilities than to try to have ffmpeg handle the http reading writing


54837695
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type


54839707
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 1	
as others have mentioned in the comments try selenium you ll need google-chrome or firefox driver installed here s example with google-chrome to get you started for more instructions see documentation


54841720
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
4 technically the argument should have type int and printf converts it to unsigned chars and prints the chars with that code


54844865
mp3	ogg
Pattern(s): 0	
for sound quality webm and ogg should be better than mp3


54845678
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 10	
you will find postgresql is much more enterprise-oriented than other products such as mysql


54846693
simctl	xcrun
Pattern(s): 5	
you wrote but you should have put xcrun in front of simctl like you did earlier in the script


54846989
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
taken from wikipedia in computer programming an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of digits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value


54848516
dplyr	lubridate
Pattern(s): 5	
first for reference here s the data i used we can use used dplyr syntax not mandatory but looks very legible and simple with lubridate functions and perform this operation very simply mdy converts the values to date objects


54855175
setinterval	clearinterval
Pattern(s): 5	
you can define the function that will be passed to setinterval define a variable to reference setinterval call clearinterval reference if c is equal to 0


54855619
hash	md5
Pattern(s): 5	
it should also be noted that md5 is a very weak hash function also collisions have been found two different plaintext values result in the same hash just use a random value for plaintext


54856008
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
int can only be combined with int of the same class or scalar double


54856445
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
in this case it doesn t need to do the conversion into an objective-c block because swift closures can be passed into objective-c and used as objective-c objects directly


54856547
comparator	comparable
Pattern(s): 5	
a priorityqueue needs to be populated with comparable elements or else be supplied with a comparator when constructed


54859700
rbenv	homebrew
Pattern(s): 5	
rbenv - can be installed with homebrew rvm to check that you re now using the non-system version of ruby you can run the following commands which ruby it should be something other than usr bin ruby ruby -v it should be something other than 2.3.7


54863695
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	
so to call the method in objective c above in first time we got a pointer to navigationcontroller. using that we are calling the poptorootviewcontrolleranimated method inside the uinavigationcontroller class with parameter value yes in objective-c yes is for true and no is for false the same thing above can be written in swift as similar to scenario in objective-c the above written syntax is in swift


54863848
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
desired output iphone xs max problematic output iphone 8 plus the height of the uiimageview is more than the height of the uiview which is not desirable current constraints i know i can t have a fixed 0.9 width

i could perhaps have used sudo -s or similar but the second problem was that i had to enter my root passwd for every package that was built


54873757
16-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
although depending how your inputs were written using 32-bit xor could be better than 16-bit xor maybe avoiding partial-register stalls if something later reads the full 32 or 64bit registers


54873878
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
i made some changes to let it work removed second for-loop used condition instead of reversing the arrays looping only to the half of the arrays if the half match the full match too here is the snippet


54873916
rbenv	homebrew
Pattern(s): 5	
rbenv - can be installed with homebrew rvm to check that you re now using the non-system version of ruby you can run the following commands which ruby it should be something other than usr bin ruby ruby -v it should be something other than 2.3.7

grafana	metrics	prometheus	grafana	prometheus	metrics
Pattern(s): 5	
prometheus will scrap the metrics which can be used by grafana for displaying as graphs. this might be useful


54878075
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
serializedname should be the name of the field itself not the complete path try changing your object class to this expose is used to decide whether the variable will be exposed for serializable and deserialization or not


54879911
put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
it s because whatever you put inside assets folder will be served via get requests

for exemple run your docker image with a volume maaping between you host folder and a temp folder docker run -v host empty dir some-temp-folder -it myimage copy your container folder with code files content into some-temp-folder to fill you host folder with you container folder run you container with a volum mapping on host empty dir but now this folder is no longer empty run -v host empty dir container folder with code files -it myimage note that steps 1 2 may be replaced by copying files from docker container to host


54895171
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 10	
all in all there is a reason why pytorch keras is more readable and sanity-preserving than tensorflow


54897792

or if you are not familiar with perl tk have more familiarity with actual tcl tk syntax or familiar with wrappers for languages tkinter for python a better option might be tkx


54903833
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
and it seems to be the case here the type returned by uint8_c possibly unsigned chars in disguise has smaller rank than int and so you end up having a signed type


54905061
daemons	systemd
Pattern(s): 0	
systemd if there is better solution than writing daemons please let me know


54905215
int	chars
Pattern(s): 2	
use unsigned chars for buffer you can also for header to avoid problem if your chars are signed and give a negative value you compare with int like 0x89 where the bit 7 is set you also have a problem for png because the values for png are 0x89 0x50 0x4e 0x47 0x0d 0x0a 0x1a 0x0a there are not ended by 0 like in all the other cases this is needed because your algorithm need to find 0 to indicate you found just add a column to also have 0 also for png


54906332
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
if you really insist you can use np.isclose to get a boolean array indicating whether each float element is close enough to it s floored int counterpart and those might be castable without too big loss in precision would give you meaning second and third element could be casted


54913513
installation	upgrade
Pattern(s): 5	
after the installation there are around 2800 scripts that should be run to upgrade the database


54914275
margin	height

54915718
strstr	strtok
Pattern(s): 5	
strcspn can be used like strtok with the set of delimiters to provide the length of the current token found to ensure strstr didn t match your search term as a lesser-included-substring of a longer word like tree in trees then it becomes a simple matter of looping with strstr and validating the length of the token with strcspn and then just applying one of the three cases above


54916425
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
set a parent container width that can be no larger than the width of the viewport center all header content try not to set explicit height on elements


54916505

ffmpeg	libavformat
Pattern(s): 5	
the 501 packet seems to be generated by libavformat rtsp.c ff_rtsp_read_reply when ffmpeg receive a malformed rtsp packet with method null status_code 0. i don t know why such packets arrive at random timing and who is wrong maybe the camera maybe any of network switches or routers in the middle of the network path from the camera to the server machine . but anyway i don t want the recording to be stopped due to those malformed packets


54921012
prometheus	metrics
Pattern(s): 5	
if your script runs once a second with the same parameters configuration then you ll probably lose some of the metrics because multiple scripts may terminate within the same second all push their metrics and only the last one s metrics will get collected by prometheus as i believe you can t set a collection interval lower than 1 second in prometheus

55008977
x86	64bit
Pattern(s): 5	
even more strange but still not a real compiler bug if you pass the -32 value as 7th or later variadic argument it may be expanded to 64bit and the output on x64 linux is 0xffffffffffffffe0 -32 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0xffffffffffffffe0 -32 0xffffffffffffffe0 -32 however the output on x64 windows is something like 0xffffffffffffffe0 -32 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00040800ffffffe0 1134700294832096 0x178bfbffffffffe0 1696726761565323232 0x00007ff6ffffffe0 140698833649632 0x00007ff6ffffffe0 140698833649632 the reason here is that in the 64bit x86 calling conventions a number of leading arguments 6 in system v amd64 abi 4 in microsoft x64 is passed via cpu registers and only subsequent arguments are passed via the stack


55009814
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
since printf is variadic it can t check the types of its arguments so a chars passed to printf will get promoted to int when the function is called


55009905

i d also like the output to be redirected to stdout instead of stderr because the logging framework we use treats all stderr content as high-priority errors


55010039
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
dividing an unsigned chars by another unsigned chars is faster than divisions involving unsigned int


55010172
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
c if no l length modifier is present the int argument is converted to an unsigned chars and the resulting chars is written. if an l length modifier is present the wint_t argument is converted as if by an ls conversion specification with no precision and an argument that points to the initial element of a two-element array of wchar_t the first element containing the wint_t argument to the lc conversion specification and the second a null wide character. c 2011 online draft so f printf expects the argument corresponding to the c conversion specifier to have type int and will convert it to unsigned chars before formatting and displaying


55017232
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 3	
both functions need the index of the element to be replaced and because of this i would recommend using for-loop instead of foreach using lset would be another way you could do it is to find the index of the element that you need to change using lsearch in which case you won t need a loops

55033483
post	put
Pattern(s): 5	
the relevant difference between put and post here is that clients should use put when they know the url where a resource should be user starred owner repo and clients should use post when they do not or should not know where the resource should be created post users which should return a link to users 138 to quote from rfc 2616 which defines http 1.1 the put method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied request-uri.

keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 1	
in ubuntu 18.04 and later you could install scipy and keras for python 3 with sudo apt install python3-scipy python3-keras and you d be good to go however you are using ubuntu 16.04 and you installed scipy for python 2 which is not compatible with tensorflow for python 3.4 3.5 and 3.6 so install the default scipy package for python 3 instead with this command sudo apt install python3-scipy for further instructions on installing tensorflow in ubuntu read this answer


55050926

json can take a while to serialize especially if you are using the r or python api because it is a separate process and needs to go back and forth between the native jvm executors on the worker nodes to serialize deserialize objects if you performed any wide transformations like aggregation or join prior to df.collect you most likely triggered a shuffle which will result in 200 default partitions being written to disk hence when you call collect it has to retrieve that data from disk which is slower than retrieving from ram although your data set is small you may need to increase the default executor ram executor cores slots # of executors and re-config the # of partitions to get more parallelism check number of partitions df.rdd.getnumpartitions check shuffle partitions spark.conf.get spark.sql.shuffle.partitions check other configs like executor ram cores and instances spark.sparkcontext.getconf .getall spark is a tough beast to tackle .

division	modulo
Pattern(s): 5	
other than the added complexity page segmentation has one other problem to work around unlike the one huge array sieve where start indexes are calculated easily once and then used for the entire array segmented sieves require either that the start addresses be calculated by modulo division operations per prime per page computationally expensive or additional memory needs to be used to store the index reached per base prime per page so the start index doesn t have to be recalculated but this last technique precludes multi-threading as these arrays get out of sync

you still have one list. the following statement just causes _btctx to point to the same list instance as btctx so actually the main list was modified in the remove and or add . one way to remove add the items is to perform a regular for-loop with an index from last to first and then you will be able to remove add items with no problem. another way would be to keep the foreach loops but store the indices to be removed and the items to be added inside loops and then perform the actual adding removal after loops removing should be done from the last index to the first

first of all please make sure that the dependency that you ve added indeed accessible by maven even without ide just run something like mvn package to see that maven downloads the dependency now if the project was imported into idea by opening the pom.xml intellij is supposed to build its internal data based on the information that was found in pom.xml so the following might help maven - reimport all maven projects - this will trigger the synchronization process settings - build execution deployment - build tools - maven maven home directory - intellij might be configured with a different maven than you think you use has something bundled with ide

goto	break
Pattern(s): 5	
there is no reason at all to use goto in your console application. the first goto parsefile is just a break in a switch case a switch case would be much more readable since you can get multiple break condition and know they are all in the same if clause the goto start is just a simple while in the beginning of your application again a while would be much more readable since you will be able to tell in one second what block of code will repeat itself also you will be able to know why it should be repeated with goto you will not be able to tell why repeat that code block until you read every line of it and know when you will not reach that goto

maven	pom.xml

after a few days of struggling i managed to do this caching later using intermediate contrainer and i d like to summarize my findings here as this topic is so useful and being frequently shown in google search frontpage kim s answer is only working to a certain condition pom.xml cannot be changed plus maven do a regular update daily basis by default mvn dependency go-offline -b --fail-never has a similar drawback so if you need to pull fresh code from repo high chances are maven will trigger a full checkout every time mount volume is not working as well because we need to resolve the dependencies during image being built finally i have a workable solution combined may be not working to others build an image to resolve all the dependencies first not intermediate image create another dockerfile with intermediate image sample dockerfiles like this #docker build -t dependencies . from ubuntu copy pom.xml pom.xml run mvn dependency go-offline -b --fail-never from dependencies as intermediate from tomcat run git pull repo.git whatsoever run mvn package the idea is to keep all the dependencies in a different image that maven can use immediately it could be other scenarios i haven t encountered yet but this solution relief me a bit from download 3gb rubbish every time i cannot imagine why java became such a fat whale in today s lean world

Pattern(s): 5	
both of them require a bit of work as fgets also stores the line-break which has to be disposed otherwise strstr would look for something like words n presumably in vain while memmove moves memory so the size has to be told explicitly and it has to include the null terminator the space-trick is still applied in the test i ve put _dunyali into the second line of input just with a space - here the formatter apparently ate that space that is why it is marked with an underscore now but in real-life you would have to take care about spaces one of which can usually removed and punctuation which may or may not be needed afterwards surrounding the words

so i just detected a problem on my fpdf when i m writing the description to the multicell i press enter to break line and this happens image with problem but my multicell code is programmed to calculate the string size and when the size is bigger than the width of the cell it ads one break line and the height size gets bigger but when i press enter it just add the same height example my name is joÃ£o - height 6.5 my name is joÃ£o line break i m using fpdf - height 6.5 + 6.5 instead of height 6.5 + 1 this is my pdf without pressing enter image this is my pdf with multicell on action image i will leave the code that it s calculating all the multicell stuff

post	get
Pattern(s): 1	
post response i receive a token but when i try to do something as simple as get limits get the response is the strange thing is that when i change all my credentials to a free developer account created with a different email address everything works fine


56118994
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 5	
i know it can be done by for-loop but i am not able to make list_name using a loops


56121279
udp	rtp
Pattern(s): 5	
according to 3 udp packets can be converted into rtp packets


56123417
division	modulo	division	subtract
Pattern(s): 5	
this can be done using modulo remainder after division the next thing is to figure out the opposite where given an encrypted character you have to find the unencrypted character by subtract 10


56124270
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 5	
you can use arrays instead of using variable so it will store all values which will be looped in for-loop


56125473
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
another case you will encounter this issue is that when you set up redirection from http to https automatically the post request will be redirected as get request if this redirection setup is at work


56128370
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
in the arrays the first element is always zero convention but i didn t zero the variables insinde the pixel loops when switching to the next pixel which gave me wrong times for a senseful computation since the number of iteration of the inner for-loop is greater then


56134329
post	get
Pattern(s): 1	
hence with right logging practices get api is as secure as post api


56134866
portrait	landscape
Pattern(s): 5	
this file needs to be printed in portrait orientation but by default it is in landscape - and i can t find any way to change orientation by script


56141684
virtualenv	conda
Pattern(s): 7	
also conda can has larger control over the environment and can for example have a different version of python installed inside of it virtualenv - only the python available in the system


56143714
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 0	
using numpy with r_ cumsum and hsplit is about 60x faster than normal loops in case col_list has 3000 lists numpy for-loop validation


56144191
flask	django
Pattern(s): 2	
flask is very similar to django but i d recommend django over flask if you plan on building this out as a larger project


56146474
int	chars
Pattern(s): 5	
i m trying to solve some problem and i need to split repeated chars and all int i tried this one but it separate and not repeated chars and not repeated int i need only chars i have a string fff86c6 i need an array fff 86 c 6


56147871
union	distinct
Pattern(s): 1	
as you didn t wanted duplicates theres no point using union all and use of distinct is simply unnecessary as union gives distinct data can create a view would be best choice as view is a virtual representation of the table


56149692
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 5	
i deploy my website and i have a bug on my upload image this image can t saved at directory my directory is in public_html on folder named files

Pattern(s): 7	7	
if any of the width height is larger then on pasting the copied image to writer document small portion of the image is grayed out


56152374
int	double
Pattern(s): 5	
i made a class for the frames assuming they are stored as an int array can easily be modified for double or any other type you want stored


56152976
post	get
Pattern(s): 5	
but in fact a search form should be submitted by get not post since it is not making changes in the backend and could conceivably be cached


56154464
post	put	post	get	put	get
Pattern(s): 5	
as http only supports post and get such a change could be requested via post other media types might support other http methods such as put which according to its specification last paragraph page 27 is allowed to have side-effects or patch which needs to be applied atomically - either fully or not at all


56154464
post	put
Pattern(s): 10	
post should work in all cases put is probably more intuitive to typical updates done in web forms while patching would require your client to actually calculate the steps needed to transform the current resource representation to the desired one if you use application json-patch+json in particular


56154646
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	0	
printf is showing you a -1 since the format of d is a signed integer which is smaller than unsigned usually by 1 bit


56154744
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
inside that if statement is another for statement which is throwing me the error - int cannot be converted to boolean

i m trying to make a multi-part form data put request with an image and it does not seem to be as easy as post requests are


56168877
sorting	filtering
Pattern(s): 7	
prepare some helper to create combined filtering function mix of filtering and searching sorting is far easier


56171017
128bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
decodes to a pure load uop on intel cpus no alu uop needed so it has 2 per clock throughput instead of 1. old cpus like merom and k8 have slow shuffle units that are only 64bit wide so shufps is pretty slow because it s a full 128bit shuffle with granularity smaller than 64bit


56175925
build.gradle	gradlew
Pattern(s): 5	
if not is there settings that can be specified in build.gradle to tell gradlew not to modify files but just to run tests

Pattern(s): 7	
i have a parent component contains header footer and a conditional rendering children component which is rendering different children component depends on the state of parent component and its state is controlled by another useeffect like the coded stated below


56182562
uilabel	uitextview
Pattern(s): 5	
i m currently building an chatbot application for a client. the chat is implemented using a uitableview with custom cells. a text message from the bot is build as a custom uitableviewcell with a uitextview because it needs to be clickable for links otherwise i would have used a uilabel wrapped inside a uiview container to draw a bubble around it

width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
setting the width to be fixed and height auto so that the image aspect ratio is maintained and visually rows look uniform


56192078
folder	directory	prop	each
Pattern(s): 5	
things i have tried using the index as key prop -- i don t think this is a good idea since i want the user to be able to rearrange the folder however they want which makes index unstable assigning each folder file with a uuid as it is read from the folder structure -- this also doesn t seem like the best idea since if i enter a different directory then return to the first directory the id s will be assigned each time


56193573
min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
the info column has to be evaluated for min max width and word-wrapping and the heading column has to be evaluated for word-wrapping based on the info columns variable width.


56193886
namedtuple	dictionary
Pattern(s): 0	
a namedtuple gets to be way more memory-efficient than a dictionary because as far as memory layout goes it s just a tuple


56196239
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 5	
as of may 2019 according to the compatibility tables of mozilla and google-chrome stale-while-revalidate is supported in the beta releases of firefox 68 tracking due to be supported in google-chrome 75 tracking these will be the main releases of those browsers on 2019-07-09 and 2019-06-09 respectively

summary i m trying to align multiple wxpython widgets horizontally at the bottom of a boxsizer but they are off by just a pixel as seen in the following screenshot as you can see the bitmaptogglebutton is positioned one pixel higher than the textctrl widget


56199743
qlikview	qliksense
Pattern(s): 5	
hi yes you need to use extension for this for example you can check also other from there is no native function for that it is in qlikview so maybe someday it will be implemented in qliksense too extension which url i shared add trigger on entersheet so you need to set that this trigger set variable for example target vsheetname expression sheet1


56199789
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
i m developing a tool to let users upload various images it resizes them if their width is higher than 1191px or the height is higher than 1684px


56201733
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
however either width or height is getting larger then browser height width


56203162
ceil	floor
Pattern(s): 1	
5 so you have to print 1 as floor and 10 as ceil then array becomes 2 so print 1 as floor and 5 as ceil and array becomes like this m queries are given


56203457
seaborn	matplotlib
Pattern(s): 1	
another option if you re not happy with seaborn but don t want to go too deep in matplotlib api is to create the errorbars with seaborn then tweak them at your convenience as i said they are just matplotlib objects if you provide a more concrete example i might be able to help more


56207077
cos	sin
Pattern(s): 5	
the points can be calculated by sin and cos distributed around a full circle two_pi draw the sides of the pyramid by triangular primitives see beginshape and draw the base of the pyramid by an closed shape see the following example which uses the function to draw pyramids with a different number of sides


56208496
post	get
Pattern(s): 1	
i tried to use format nested json but not relevant with post http because my api must send api key for get response value


56210331
cout	cin
Pattern(s): 7	7	
to have it more equivalent to the java version change your c++ main to note that by default c++ s console i o iostream cin cout is even slower than it could be because syncronization with c s console i o stdio scanf printf is enabled to let a program not do weird things if both cout and printf are used. here you can read about cout s performance when synchronization is turned off


56214163
dplyr	tidyr
Pattern(s): 7	
still the tidyr dplyr solution looks better


56214792
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	0	
i add second label called content2 if i set grow 0 content2 will not fill extra vertical space if i set grow 1 content2 will fill extra vertical space shrink property plays a role when the wrap property is set to nowrap and the aggregate width of a row of children is greater than the width of the flexlayout or the aggregate height of a single column of children is greater than the height of the flexlayout


56216097

Pattern(s): 5	
for the third case z will be promoted to int with value 1 then converted to double for the comparison


56218813
qstring	qbytearray

i now have 2 separate but related optimization functions i want to implement given a max number of videos c and a minimum total number of views v find the set of videos that maximize the average score


56232763
vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 10	
i would prefer to disable it completely on the desktop since there s a vsto add-in that does much more then the js api is even capable of but since i have not found a way to do that so my only option now seems to be make the js version work globally


56233663
elasticsearch	kibana
Pattern(s): 5	
from logstash i want to send data to elasticsearch to be visualized by kibana


56236139
scylla	cassandra
Pattern(s): 5	
the problem does not seem to be related to cassandra or scylla. you do need access to docker hub to download the relevant image for the first time for example when running docker run hello-world once you solve that you can move to run cassandra or scylla with for example with docker run --name some-scylla -d scylladb scylla


56238877
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	
my question is this udp is way faster than tcp and a delayed packet has no more value than a lost packet in most cases so udp seemed like the best choice


56246330
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
the normal way of doing this would be to use two nested loops - if you re iterating over a known number of items rather than unboundedly until some condition holds then for-loop is easier for x in 0


56246832
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
i m sorry to say this and maybe i m not solving your problem exactly but postgresql is 10 years older than mysql and is extremely advanced compared to mysql and there s many ways to achieve this easily

56249728
ceil	floor
Pattern(s): 0	0	
to stop the confusion on this page actually this is the best answer which is fast and works for both positive and negative values of x i ran speed tests of 10 million computations on php 7.2.15 and even though both solutions give the same results fmod is slower than floor ceil


56253671
serializable	deserialization
Pattern(s): 5	
optionally serializable names properties need to be reconciled with deserialization names here constructor parameters via jsonproperty attributes


56258932
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	5	
except it is theoretically possible that int is wider than uint64_t in which case the arithmetic would be done with int but that is still satisfactory performing a cast guarantees the arithmetic will be done with at least that width. for real numbers the usual arithmetic conversions are largely if either operand is long double the other is converted to long double


56258957
cpu	affinity
Pattern(s): 7	
further more in deadline scheduling kernel rejects setting when cpu affinity mask is smaller than the entire root_domain in what case would cpu affinity mask become smaller than the root_domain span


56261680
hash-collision	key
Pattern(s): 0	
exactly what ratio depends on how hash-collision will be handled - namely either alternative buckets will be found open addressing aka closed hashing with a good hash function 20-50 more buckets than key is a generally sane range each bucket contains some chain of elements that hashed there separate chaining with a good hash function it doesn t matter as much so you could have half as many buckets as key or twice as many and things will rock along without any great drama that said when the hash function isn t good and the key being hashed aren t random enough to help the hash function perform adequately it helps to have a tablecapacity that reduces collisions try any prime number around the value derived from the number-of-keys-being-hashed and the ratios listed above


56261712
ionic	angular
Pattern(s): 10	
there is a more updated fork of this plugin available at you could probably use ionic native for angular which gives a more angular like api otherwise you should be able to work with filechooser directly as this is the js object that is added to the global scope make sure to wait for the deviceready event before trying to access it


56262907
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	
opening a tcp socket is more costly that opening a udp socket because opening and closing a tcp socket creates a tcp session whereas opening and closing a udp socket is a local action only

56283399
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	7	0	
step away from concrete numbers and for example check that a both elements width and height are positive integral numbers b check that the width is larger than the height which should be the case for a text like abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz c test that for the height is larger than the width

Pattern(s): 5	
implementing a module which has both setter and getter functionality is fundamentally at odds with objects do not get mutated a setter as commonly understood is always a mutation


56296876
lisp	scheme
Pattern(s): 10	10	
i have heard that common lisp is more broadly featured while scheme is more conservative and austere but in my casual use i haven t been able to find any feature of common lisp that was not also in scheme

try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
can we handle checked exception-handling inside the module using try-catch block


56303590
distance	polygons
Pattern(s): 0	
use intersection area minus non-common area as a metric of similarity shapely can be used for that non-common area is union - intersection or simply symmetric difference final metric intersection.area - symmetric_difference.area intersection area this approach might be better than processing distance in some situations for example you want to prefer fewer points covering whole area over huge amount of very close points that cover only half of the area it s more obvious way to compare candidates with different number of points but it has it s disadvantages too just draw some examples on paper and experiment to find them other ideas instead of using polygons or concave hull you can build a linear ring from your points and then use contour.buffer some_distance

56316915
timeit	itertools
Pattern(s): 10	
some remarks for improvements do not use global variables use timeit for meaningful measurements use python 3 i think you can use permutations from itertools which is faster in generating but also produces less data make everything possible constant


56318100
fread	memcmp
Pattern(s): 2	
tom karzes compare non-strings with memcmp unnecessary code is not need to detect the end use the fread return value


56319145
mvp	presenter
Pattern(s): 10	
as for your existing architecture mvp it is better to put the logic in the presenter actually there should not be any logic on the view in your case custom view aside from taking input eg click of a button and providing output


56322162
try-catch	exception-handling
Pattern(s): 5	
however because c# does not have checked exception-handling the only way i can think of anticipating exception-handling s is to surround all sections of my top-calling code with try-catch es


56324573
qscrollarea	qframe
Pattern(s): 7	
if the following is added you get the following pyqt5.qtcore.qsize 38 22 pyqt5.qtcore.qsize 20 20 where we see that the qscrollarea has a greater width in the sizehint than the qframe and that explains why the observed behavior


56325139

int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
in s is a wrong format because you write a chars not a string out of that the natural type for an index is size_t not int use size_t for both i and len and in that case change the loop to use index without supposing it can be negative if the input string has more than 19 chars scanf will write out of word with an undefined behavior limit the size using the format 19s 19 rather than 20 to have the place for the ending null chars word is an array do not use a to give its address in scanf check the result of scanf if you want to detect eof flush the output writing a newline after the loop so a possible way is

for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 1	
just make the virtual function return a reference to the data directly you need to change to vector then - not possible with arrays or c style arrays types with different sizes or if pointers are the only feasible option as a pointer range iterators range adapter would be preferred though if possible - more on that to make this last method work with range-based for-loop one way is to make a small range view type that has the functions begin end - essential a pair with begin end example then construct it with it is easy to make it non-template if a template is not desired

56672107
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 7	
a correct answer will depend on what type the key and value parts are if one of them is a for example the equals comparison is trickier but in general assuming that all the keys and values have their equals and gethashcode methods implemented correctly we can use the system.linq extension methods any and except to get the result

56689895
int	double	min	max
Pattern(s): 7	7	
a proposal can be compilation and execution as you can see i name the variable from their behavior making the code more clear contrarily to a b and c the right type for an index is size_t i do not use a literal int but i use sizeof in the for to follow the size of the array even if it is changed i use infinity to initialize min because any valid double is lower that it and -infinity to initialize max because any valid double is greater that it in case of an invalid input on scanf i flush all the line before to redo you can also just read a word if you prefer in the printf you do not need the l because printf cannot receive a float whose are transformed to double but the l is necessary in scanf to read a double

domxpath	domdocument
Pattern(s): 5	
to check an imei here first you have to enable cookie handling in curl that can be done with curlopt_cookiefile also utf-8 is not a valid transfer-encoding and makes no sense instead do next you have to fetch the page with a normal get request this will give curl the cookie needed to check an imei and give curl the csrf token needed to check an imei after you got the cookie which is handled automatically by curl and the csrf token in the html you need to extract the token from the html that can be done with domdocument and domxpath and finally now that you have both the session cookie and the csrf token you can do the imei lookup request and to get the response from the html one can again use domdocument which yields because 999999999999999 was not a valid imei code

range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
better compression with range constraints adding a self-imposed constraint partitions are sorted from largest to lowest part we can deduce for p in parts num size max constraints 2 3 can be applied recursively to all by noting that is in therefore we can compute better imin imax and inject them in the previous implementation live demo todo sanity checks the provided implementations can go into undefined behaviour if the partition is not sorted or the partition index is not valid


56759546
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 7	
solving int constraints is significantly harder than solving pure boolean constraints and when you use int to model boolean like this the underlying solver simply explores the search space that s just unreachable

56830622
realloc	calloc	free	calloc	free	realloc
Pattern(s): 7	
this is evidently what happened in your example since your realloc call asks for less memory than was allocated by calloc and we can see that it didn t do that here since the address of ptr when free is called is the same as the block allocated by calloc


56833365
scikit-learn	lda	mallet	lda
Pattern(s): 5	
ng20 perplexity i have experimented with scikit-learn gensim and the gensim mallet wrapper and all packages do show different perplexity values which can be expected since lda is randomly initalized + different inference algorithms but the common pattern is that the perplexity does increase for every package which contradicts many papers from the literature


56837425
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 1	
you can also use glue client to do the same thing with batch_create_partition or create_partition methods but this would require different inputs then athena client update 2019-07-03 if your data has structure like s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 27 00 00001.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 27 00 00002.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 27 01 00001.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 27 01 00002.json ... s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 28 00 00001.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 28 00 00002.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 28 01 00001.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 28 01 00002.json but you only want to have only 3 partitions year month day then definition of your table should take that into account then ddl statements for adding partitions should be remember that in s3 there is not such thing as folder or directory

56851212
submit	submission
Pattern(s): 5	
in my e-commerce project in admin panel there are forms used to edit information about categories products users etc. i m using context api for my global state. so in my categoryedit component i m using to give fields initial values fetched from database. but then when i m trying to change values in field using common obviously nothing happens because values are not bound from the categoryedit component state . also putting setstate to componentdidmount doesn t work because data in provider is fetched in async way so at first value is empty. i do not want to bind this form value changes to global state because this changes can be canceled and they should be refetched after submission form. so what i want is - to initially fill form using values from provider - then pass them to categoryedit state once - then handle changes of the component state - submit data to database using asyncronous fetch inside categoryedit component - tell provider via action that it can update is this the right pattern to do such things or there s a better way to handle forms in react using context

-- numa control -- myisam is deprecated and mostly less desirable than innodb -- local_infile on is a potential security issue -- size of qc -- too small not of much use


56878347
width	height
Pattern(s): 5	
there are a number of things things that need addressing in your code to get the issues sorted 1 the height and width of your images and iframe should not be defined as width 1179x1179 height 480x480

56891659
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
if it would return a point outside the bounds of the control either negative x y or x y value being greater than width and height of the control i could easily decide that it was not just left for a control being a visual child but a control in another part of the visual tree


56891672
children	parent
Pattern(s): 5	
you don t have to start your route with in your nested routes because routes starting from will be considered parent route try this in your children and then example.com comparator id will route you to correct component

Pattern(s): 0	
they first find the best solution with fractions values for the variables number of steps then successively divide the allowed region into smaller sections with integer edges and eventually stop when they find the best solution at an edge


56894689
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
since you are using a component with all your property fields can only be read via getter and written via setter


56894887
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 7	7	
how about this from a programming perspective this isn t as good a solution as the one that uses an object because an object map dictionary is easier to extend to other values


56896816
button	checkbox
Pattern(s): 5	
it can be done with checkbox as well but based on your requirement it will always be feasible and more efficient to use the radio button since it by default provides you the functionality of choosing only one option whereas in case of checkbox you will have to write down more code explicitly to provide it the same functionality which in turn increases your codebase and does no good


56897091
ant	maven
Pattern(s): 1	
unless you are using netbeans 11.1 which is currently in beta i would not use this option as gradle support in older versions is not as good as ant or maven support


56900344
min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
first the check for greater than 1 can be replaced by min since contentoffset.y could also be negative you might want to prevent negative values using max now if you want to flip the direction simply subtract that value from 1 alternatively do it in one line finally set the color

next	except
Pattern(s): 7	
this is my current approach while true try next it except stopiteration logging.info no more results to process. return except socket.timeout logging.warning encountered timeout. if i retry the same item enough times by rerunning the script manually the timeout will resolve itself so i d like to be able to retry the problematic item programmatically instead of just repeating the search multiple times


56909608
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
the rules for inserting into a min heap add new item to the end of the array while the new item is larger than its parent swap the new item with its parent the rules for removing the top item in the heap the smallest save the top item move the last item in the array to the first position while the item is larger than either of its children swap the item with its smallest child

dplyr	rlang
Pattern(s): 1	7	
for simple equations that take a single input it s sufficient to supply the function itself or when using an equation rather than a simple function via a formula when using equations that access more than a single variable you need to use rlang quosures instead here quo creates a quosure a quoted representation of your equation same as your use of strings except unlike strings this one is properly scoped is directly usable by dplyr and is conceptually cleaner it is like any other r expression except not yet evaluated

my current algorithm is very inefficient and not pretty eg the number is 940 800 generate an array of random single digits excluding 0 that multiplying up to 940 800 if the size is less than 8 add the rest of the space with 1 if the size is greater than 8 try removing the 1s if the size is greater than 8 try to reduce it down by removing double 2 or double 3 if the size is greater than 8 this set of random digits is not possible

we still loop through days but we do all 100 simulations at once by generating an array of random numbers and making use of numpy s element-wise multiplication which is much faster than using a loop you will need to add the following import import numpy as np and then replace your nested loop with this single loop edit to add because you are using a very simple formula which only involves basic multiplication you actually can get rid of both loops by generating a random matrix of numbers using numpy s cumulative product function column-wise and multiplying it by a dataframe where each value begins at 100

postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 0	
when i rewrite left join by subquery it took only 111ms attached plans while googling i have found this blog post in most cases joins are also a better solution than subqueries postgresql will even internally rewrite a subquery creating a join whenever possible but this of course increases the time it takes to come up with the query plan many so question like this a left outer join can be faster than an equivalent subquery because the server might be able to optimize it better a fact that is not specific to mysql server alone

i want to change the column type from object to int in the following way this method worked for other columns but for this one column it does not work because a few percent of rows have a value that can not be converted to int which is exactly the scores column in which several percent of rows have something like this 1050 1500 it should be just 1050 i used regex to find these rows in the following way now i just need to delete the 5 chars from these rows and save the columns but i don t know how to do it without specifying in which specific row i want to do it

57186768
scipy	mpmath
Pattern(s): 1	
if that still doesn t give you enough accuracy you can try to increase the precision. however the main issue with doing this in numpy is that the lapack functions under the hood are compiled for float64. thus even if the numpy function allows inputs of higher precision float128 it will round them before calling the lapack functions. it might be possible to recompile those functions for higher precision but that may not be worth the effort for your particular problem. as a side note i m not very familiar with scipy so it may be the case that they have eigensolvers written in python which support all different types but you need to be careful that they are actually doing every step in the higher precision and not silently rounding to float64 somewhere. for your problem i would suggest using the package mpmath which supports arbitrary precision linear algebra. it is a bit slower since everything is done in software but for 14x14 matrices it should still be pretty quick

dplyr	purrr
Pattern(s): 0	
i am more familiar with dplyr and purrr and used them to implement it below


57382266
stdout	stderr
Pattern(s): 5	
but you should use proc_open instead so you can inspect both stdout and stderr the other answers here only allows you to inspect stdout which is not very helpful in detecting errors if an error occurs the error will most likely be printed in stderr php prints errors to stderr by default not stdout.


57385551
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 5	
i ve been looking for good examples of how to implement binary classification in tensorflow in a similar manner to the way it would be done in keras


57386013
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
your image component is actual vertically bottom set backgroundcolor and you ll see it but as the actual image not image component will resize to fit the image componenti. in this case because of width is bigger height so the image will verticaly center inside image component you need either set resizemode cover or change abosolute property top bottom

subtract	add
Pattern(s): 10	
attempt 1 check whether adding or subtract is better with one bit of information start x1 add x+1 0 divide x+1 2 operations subtract x0 divide x 2 operations we reach an impass if x or x+1 were even the optimal move would be to divide


57386889
subtract	add
Pattern(s): 10	
attempt 2 check whether adding or subtract is better with two bits of information start x01 add x10 divide x1 add x+1 0 divide x+1 4 operations subtract x0 divide x 4 operations subtract x00 divide x0 divide x 3 operations add x+1 possibly not optimal 4 operations conclusion for x01 subtract will result in at least as few operations as adding 3 and 4 operations versus 4 and 4 operations to reach x and x+1


57389385
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 5	5	
you can use only enums witch can be represented in objective-c enums without nested enums enums without parameters enums raw types should be integer therefore you can only create another enum witch can be represented in objective-c and just add method to convert to it and create somewhere swift method to another side


57391475

behat	mink
Pattern(s): 5	
this is how it can be done in behat with mink #behat #mink


57432817
min	max
Pattern(s): 5	
therefore i think if internally there are some calculation corresponding to range.data.input it needs to be set as min max for each row but the setting for this is actually not min and max for each row


57433736
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 0	0	
this is better than malloc free at least because new will automatically call a constructor and delete will call a destructor


57434945
inputmismatchexception	arithmeticexception
Pattern(s): 5	
i ve set two exceptions to be handled inputmismatchexception and arithmeticexception for division by zero

57500076
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	subtraction	subtraction	multiplication
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you re getting that error because you re trying to multiplying a timestamp by 1440 rather than the difference between the date and timestamp - multiplication has higher precedence than subtraction


57500723
children	parent

prepare	execute
Pattern(s): 5	
you can even put your build dependencies into devdependencies and they will be installed before prepare is execute


57505222
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
i continued using comparisons to get the correct solution and adjusted the exceptions to take the mid to be a value which is either repeated three times or twice if it s not less than max or greater than min


57506607
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
as long as you don t need it s width to ever be shorter than the width of a single space -- uitextfields sizes are calculated using the placeholder property by default -- then this will always have the height of a non-empty uitextfield regardless of whether it contains text or not


57511114
rsa	aes
Pattern(s): 5	
as i want to stay with a public and a private key only i came up with the idea to use a hard-coded aes key which will be encoded with rsa public key and than use this to encode the data


57511158
interpolation	splines
Pattern(s): 5	
the following code should simulate sparse sampling by taking a observation every 4 hours from the sample data set and the second portion should add rows with there respective x values every 0.1 of an hour which will later be filled with interpolation values derived from a cubic splines


57514296
google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 1	
you can at the moment only directconnect with google-chrome and firefox. see docs here directconnect basically means you don t need a selenium server to execute the browser commands for you. however if you need to lets say run your tests against internet explorer edge safari you ll need a selenium server for that


57516414
rsa	aes
Pattern(s): 0	
i want to encrypt and store a token which is longer than what rsa permits but i can t use aes because if i want to secure it with biometrics then i have to ask for user authentication even when i am encrypting the value and not only when decrypting it as with rsa


57516660
keystore	jks
Pattern(s): 10	10	
it could possibly be that we didn t build our jks keystore truststores correctly more on how we built these files below

it seems that python doc didn t say may be this claim is incorrect please fix it if needed list comprehensions is faster than for-loop here are 2 functions the performance of function v1 for-loop approach timeit find_base_match_v1 d grid 10.6 ns 0.419 ns per loops mean std


57523660
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
boolean can be treated as int sic etc


57523688
aggregate-functions	sum
Pattern(s): 0	
if you want to get a single value from the query it s better to use the value function or even better with an aggregate-functions like sum the error you have is because you are trying to sum two standard objects the get function returns an array of standard objects you can also solve using this line with your own queries


57530075
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 3	
i prefer using settimeout and call it each time when needed that way you don t need a global variable to maintain the value returned by setinterval


57530119
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
scroll happens when you try fill in a box more than its width or height so you can simply hidden the vertical horizontal scroll or set parent height to auto


57531691
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 5	
while trying to answer c++ bare getter setter with dispatch i thought of the following solution to create a class that implements getter setter like behavior while avoiding any macros which could then be used to create member variables that can have custom getter and or setter functions like so the above code compiles without any problem but as soon as i try to use it i get an error that there is no viable candidate function when trying to assign to such a property variable the output from clang++ is the error message suggests that is never considered


57532838
min	max	filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 5	
this will be used to filtering out unrelated rows remove rows which are not with concern final step now for df_1 grouping by trip-id and d2 find the min and max of f.struct timestamp speed which will return the first and last records in the grouping select the corresponding fields from the struct to get the final result note remove the intermediate dataframe df_1 we can have the following

Pattern(s): 0	0	
if the value of the tree is less than the min and greater than the max we return false as it is not a valid bst condition


57538352
range	min	range	max	min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
the first if statement is saying if the value of the tree node is less than the min or more than the max then you are not a valid bst and the second statement is saying if your value is within the range of min and max you are a valid bst


57543236
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
as pow returns a double which has a much larger range than either int or long long int you could have

or do we need to test somehow if in some devices the height can be larger than the width


57547054
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 10	8	
note how it lists the where columns first on the assumption that filtering is more important than grouping index active deletedon -- in either order updatedon tacking on frame_id id in either order but at the end would turn it into a covering index thereby gaining a little more speed


57547762

there are many different ways to do this but i would recommend using node.js + express for middleware and mongodb for your database


57548293
client-side	server-side
Pattern(s): 5	
if your pages are generated dynamically server-side the page itself won t be cached client-side therefore your svgs aren t cached either and have to be loaded each time


57553199
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
note on requirement for a specific scenario i need vertical margins w.r.to container parent element height instead of width which is browser s actual behavior


57555146
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 5	
i have a pandas series with the following string values for simplicity i have chosen to display it as a list i want to remove the duplicated words here but to do that i need to remove the punctuation first now i can remove duplicated words this is the result i have now this is ok my problem now is that i need to keep the punctuation but i haven t seen any way of removing duplicated words without stripping out the punctuation characters in the strings


57556067

you can use a regular expression to accomplish this as well you will need to have added a vba reference to microsoft vbscript regular expressions x.x


57565907
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 5	
column types in the database are inferred from the property types you used number will be converted into int string into varchar boolean into bool etc


57566649
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
you are not doing anything incorrect in your statement but as 0 is the chars representation of the nul chars it s somewhat inconvenient strange or imprecise to compare a pointer value with a chars literal and suggests you are interpreting the not as a pointer but more as an int or chars value. but i repeat it s something perfectly legal in c language


57575148
public	protected
Pattern(s): 5	
i know that class variables need that definition but php states that defining visiblity for methods is optional class methods may be defined as public private or protected


57576973

Pattern(s): 5	
note that vba will not honor this flag because members cannot be hidden in vba user code should work fine in vb6 though


57579718
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 7	
and finally if you are beginning with docker etc i recommend to use mod-php with apache which is easier to setup than php-fpm with nginx considering php-fpm with apache makes no sense

57587384
filtering	grouping
Pattern(s): 5	
to keep things simple let s first define a helper function which can be used to grouping single-key objects by key next we ll use inputs with the -n command line option don t forget -n . if the ordering of the keys is important then simply use this filtering def sort_by_keys to_entries | sort_by .key|tonumber | from_entries


57589572
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception	invalidoperationexception	objectdisposedexception	objectdisposedexception	argumentnullexception
Pattern(s): 5	5	
and with the smtpclient the msdn documentation says that one of the following four exceptions can be thrown argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception objectdisposedexception smtpexception so you should do it like this the reason for this is much better logging if you know the exception that was thrown the log could display something like argumentnullexception was thrown insert a possible explanation as to why or if you want to handle all exceptions the same way
