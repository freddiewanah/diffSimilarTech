nullpointerexceptionillegalargumentexception
Pattern(s): 10
In my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since nullpointerexception s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

cairngorm   puremvc
Pattern(s): 8
Puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t puremvc

gif png
Pattern(s): 10
There might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but png s really not worth the worry

centos  solaris centos  linux
Pattern(s): 7
And i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on centos are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better

bluej   greenfoot
Pattern(s): 10
greenfoot is developed by the same people that made bluej but greenfoot is way more graphical still allowing full java programming of the applications


283405
jboss   glassfish
Pattern(s): 7
Jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find jboss easier to understand

photoshop   fireworks
Pattern(s): 7
I find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because fireworks re first class objects while in photoshop fireworks re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill


412091
postgresql  mysql
Pattern(s): 0
postgresql s a lot more enterprise-ready than mysql not to mention that postgresql follows the sql standard a lot better


451931
hex binary
Pattern(s): 10
When looking at low level commands binary often makes more sense to match the cpu and think in hex


562587
vsto	add-in
Pattern(s): 10	
vsto means that your add-in is no longer com-visible


610494
strcpy	strncpy
Pattern(s): 7	
Of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what strncpy does


763284
swt	swing
Pattern(s): 2	
I would recommend swt over swing any day as swt is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and native-feeling swt app while swt takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app -- with a client app the ability to auto-update is very useful


803700
nginx	lighttpd
Pattern(s): 10	
nginx s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd


1050778
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
Pattern(s): 7	
The graphicsmagick group overhauled the tiff format support with graphicsmagick version 1.2 and graphicsmagick is much faster at processing these types of images than the original imagemagick was


1201337
memcpy	memmove
Pattern(s): 0	
This means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as memmove can not make the same assumptions


1243627
code128	code39
Pattern(s): 7	0	
Edit data density in code128 is better than code39 - since code128 gets mentioned that often in other replies


1270393
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 7	
Traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on mysql


1284374
boost	allocator
Pattern(s): 7	
Yeah boost works but boost is 20 slower than my implementation with dynamic allocator and code is 80 bigger


1316464
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 3	10	
Otherwise i recommend using postgresql over mysql since postgresql is more standards compliant and has a nicer license


1372564
bazaar	git
Pattern(s): 0	
A lot of articles about bazaar will tell you bazaar is a lot slower than git or mercurial


1514244
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
Theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because udp s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control


1551254
equals	compareto
Pattern(s): 7	
If all you care about is equality then the equals method is the best choice simply because compareto makes more sense to the next programmer that takes a look at your code


1577097
boost	stl
Pattern(s): 10	
While boost is more modern c++ boost also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge boost is difficult to use correctly


1647114
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 10	
Ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that myisam s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance


1722180
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 3	
You should use innodb in such scenarios and most mysql gurus recommend using innodb by default anyway because innodb s considered more generally reliable than myisam despite being slower under some use cases


1730317
innodb	myisam
Pattern(s): 7	
If you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that innodb offers a much better level of durability - if you tune innodb for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully


1823057
junit	testng
Pattern(s): 10	
If you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get testng done in junit


1947258
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 10	
One main advantage to tcp though is that tcp traverses firewalls more easily than udp


1050778
imagemagick	graphicsmagick

2269313
haskell	ocaml
Pattern(s): 10	10	0	
Secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is haskell does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor


2360151
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 8	
I like postgresql because i come from an oracle background so postgresql feels more comfortable than mysql


2415287
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii	cakephp	yii
Pattern(s): 10	
You should be able to solve this using cakephp symfony codeigniter yii zend or any other framework so codeigniter is better to do some real testing


2605897
postgresql	mysql
Pattern(s): 2	
I personally prefer postgresql over mysql and find postgresql very scalable even with millions or even billions of rows when setup correctly


2666124
bazaar	svn
Pattern(s): 10	
You could try bazaar bazaar as bazaar supports workflows but i don t know if bazaar is really faster or wait for svn 1.7 with wc-ng and centralized meta-data


2699569
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 0	
For suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which dictionary s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc


2790446
mef	prism
Pattern(s): 10	8	
Here are a few good ones mvvm light mef simple mvvm i d recommend not using prism as mef is more complicated than mef needs to be


2795286
strtol	atoi
Pattern(s): 10	
Well i suppose you can use atoi instead of strtol which simplifies the error handling because atoi is less precise it doesn t get much simpler than this


2912577
apache	nginx
Pattern(s): 8	
Also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having nginx on the front end nginx gives you a lot of flexibility


2927816
exponent	modulo
Pattern(s): 7	0	
The private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt exponent using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero


3033387
cpython	ironpython
Pattern(s): 0	
It s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as ironpython are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and . net clr


3218551
quicksort	heapsort
Pattern(s): 7	
Unless you re going to write a very good sort probably quicksort merge sort or heapsort depending on your specific needs quicksort will be better and quicksort takes fewer lines of code


3333067
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
Although google-chrome does take a little longer than in firefox but that may just be my computer


3417026
verilog	vhdl
Pattern(s): 10	
Both vhdl and verilog are high level langauges and while different from c and c++ vhdl aren t significantly harder just different and require a different thought process


3770950
haskell	agda
Pattern(s): 0	
Another popular language that offers more power than haskell is agda - i don t know agda beyond knowing haskell is dependently typed on hackage and well respected by people i respect but those are good enough reasons to me


3771477
haskell	agda
Pattern(s): 10	
Coq is probably the most prominent language of the style but agda has a more haskell-y feel as well as being written in haskell haskell


3842231
ubuntu	centos
Pattern(s): 3	
If you don t have a favorite distro i would recommend trying ubuntu centos as ubuntu tend to be quite friendly to the beginner and have extremely robust community support


3844399
nunit	mstest
Pattern(s): 10	
Thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest nunit is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar


5070199
quicksort	mergesort
Pattern(s): 0	
Quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances quicksort can degrade to quadratic running time


5123066
strncmp	strcmp
Pattern(s): 7	0	
strncmp is much safer than strcmp


5332864
cpython	pypy
Pattern(s): 0	
From a pypy blog post in february ... highlights and the status of pypy most python benchmarks run much faster than with cpython or psyco the real-world pypy compiler toolchain pypy 200 klocs runs twice as fast supports x86 32 and 64bit and is in the process of supporting arm .


5372482
scheme	racket
Pattern(s): 0	
There are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and scheme surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance


5423061
udp	tcp
Pattern(s): 0	
Tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as tcp requires the client to send back packet confirmations
