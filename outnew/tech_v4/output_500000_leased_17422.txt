ratingbar	imageview
Pattern(s): 7	
the user can touch drag or use arrow keys to set the rating when using the default size ratingbar as per ypur requirement you need to make custom ratingbar using imagebutton or imageview which you want to use with touchlistener but is not good way as ratingbar when using a ratingbar that supports user interaction placing widgets to the left or right of ratingbar is discouraged the number of stars set via setnumstars int or in an xml layout will be shown when the layout width is set to wrap content if another layout width is set the results may be unpredictable

int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
instead you can search for the last space in the string and take anything before sscanf as the name make sure sscanf is less than 15 chars + 1 null terminator and everything after the space you pass to strtol which converts sscanf to int

lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
Pattern(s): 10	
it s installed with lxml in fact you probably want to use lxml instead of libxml2 because lxml is based on libxml2 is more pythonic sudo pip install lxml libxml2 page says note that some of the python purist dislike the default set of python bindings rather than complaining i suggest some of the python purist have a look at lxml the more pythonic bindings for libxml2 and libxslt and check the mailing-list

width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
and assign this method on list group click important although this code should work in most cases i had some problems when child list items were textviews with hence child list items height depended on child list items width which might be connected to this problem viewgroup textview .. .getmeasuredheight gives wrong value is smaller than real height


51086974
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	0	
i tried what the previous post recommanded but it doesn t really work here is the code based on the previous post change one of example 1 since unsigned chars is smaller than int to unsigned int since x is already an unsigned int we only apply the int promotion to y

int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
if this operation overflows this operation means the range of double is smaller than the range of int and we can use dbl_max -dbl_max as max_double_to_int and min_double_to_int respectively


51229306
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
this question doesn t make much sense as t excludes sed and awk which would be the obvious answers and also restricts the solution to a for-loop whereas a while loops is the more usual choise

flask abstracts all the boring wsgi http stuff nicely but flask s more minimal than django


51388053
getattr	setattr
Pattern(s): 7	
a typical reader can figure out what a getattr means more easily than figuring out a setattr plus a descriptor __get__ call to manually bind a method obviously and it still won t help many static tools understand your type s methods


51393834
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
as ulrich eckhardt pointed out a better way to implement this is to use a for-loop this s more clear this way and the scope of ptr is limited to loops which is good because we don t need it later

width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
you can set the width and height of an iframe to configure how much of the website will be visible at one time but making the width and height smaller than the width and height of the website will just cause scrollbars to appear so the user can scroll to see the whole website

bufferedreader	filechannel
Pattern(s): 0	
lines filechannel might perform better than the bufferedreader - but i also find lines filechannel a lot more low-level in lines filechannel api so unless you have very special performance requirements i would leave the readahead buffering to bufferedreader and filereader

sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 0	
will work as long as all your users are on the planet after making all the calculations use an array sorting method to find the x closest nodes to each node and there you have it you may or may not want to prevent a user being grouping on more than one grouping but that s just business logic actual code would be a little too much to provide at this time without seeing some of your progress first but this is basically what you need to do algoritmically

52457528
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
to check by doing would require you to implement your arrays as below and it will look for keys that are identical to your search or if you want to search for a word in the keys of an associative arrays or with a foreach however doing a foreach with a for-loop is faster and more optimized

in your case for instance you initialise a variable called value to be the minimum your test to continue is whether value is less than max which it will be unless min is greater than max the thing you do each time after executing the body of loops is .


52604045
min	max	subtract	add
Pattern(s): 0	
this is a lot simpler how this works strips off the minutes and seconds from the time reducing every date to just the date and the hour finds the max consumption in that hour finds the max consumption value whose id is less than the min id in the hour the max consumption value from the previous hour subtract the max consumption this hour from the max consumption last hour to give the consumption for this hour there are other ways to skin this cat this works by join the data to the data on id id-1 gets you a this table and a previous table work out the change in consumption between successive records this.value - previous.value and then group them up by the hour same technique as above reduce the datetime to a date and add on the hour s and sum them edit modified the first query to work with your revised sample data the significant change is added a where clause to restrict the rows to just the subset day and device

timsort is faster than mergesort but timsort still slower than quicksort because quicksort has fewer data movements on random data quicksort requires o log n extra space while timsort requires o n to provide stability which also leads to an overhead


52763512
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you have to respect the aspect ration when you calculate the distance to the center point of the circular view note if you have a rectangular viewport where the width is greater than the height then a perfect circle is squeezed at a perfect circle left and right to an ellipse when the coordinates are transformed from view space the normalized devices space

you probably need arrays of int which makes some sense since it probably wants more precision than an int can give to be double or floats


52921784
median	max

width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
as you already state content mode option aspect fill tries to fill up the live view and you are also right that the live view crops some rectangle from center cropping top-bottom or left-right depending upon the image size and the image view size for generic solution there are two possible case the image needed to be cropped along the height to fit the image view proportional drawing height is smaller the image needed to be cropped along the width to fit the image view proportional drawing width is smaller considering your size notation is 4000x3000 height 4000 width 3000 a portrait image and your drawing canvas size is 375x800 height 375 width 800 then your cropping would be height wise while setting the content mode aspect fill

Pattern(s): 0	
for the case where answer is neither 1 nor max of the range +1 for this case we will need a segment tree that will give smallest missing positive value that is greater than minimum value of the range and less than maximum value of the range  we will use value 0 to represent there is no missing value for this range  for leaf node we will set missing value to 0

for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
afterwards return false if the number of 7s is 0 or true if the number of 7s the number of 7s found in the arrays in a for-loop is higher than 0 2 another much quicker way would be to return true in the for -loop when you encounter a 7 and after the for -loop just return false


53186096
int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
however this introduces manual memory management and this can become tricky in more complex code memory leaks double deallocations dangling pointers so a more c++ like solution would be assuming the pointers point to something more interesting than an int because now there seems to be no need for pointers

int	double
Pattern(s): 0	
if you wrap a c type as an nsnumber and then unwrap you application needs to have an actual pointer on the swift side as above could the type change due to argument promotion which means that int types smaller than int get passed as int values float values as double in c

pandas	astropy
Pattern(s): 8	
python s collection.counter is an easy way to get the answer here to do python s collection.counter with astropy one way would be to add a column of 1 that you can then aggregate but this is probably less flexible than pandas as i think that the aggregate function must be applied to all columns

53924864
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
let s add some border and we will clearly see what is happening as you can see the nested sticky elements are both having both width equal to parent width since both are block element so there is no room for the left-sticky to have any sticky behavior 1 since it has width 100 unlike the top one that can still stick because it height is less that the parent height

orchestration	microservices	stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 7	
advantages 1.decentralized and decoupled architecture using choreography rather than orchestration makes services publish-subscribe based and as a result fully decentralized 2.do one thing and do it well unix philosophy more focused and singular with very narrow functionality 3.easy to have parallelism and load balancing because of being more fine-grained from the business process point of view 4.statelessness however having a stateful microservices is valid but it is not the ideal 5.individual data storage makes services relaxed to keep tracing the data-flow 6.easy and automated deployment and discovery due to use of container engine-based technologies such as docker 7.more interoperability which makes services able to have more flexibility in accepting dropping a new current service or protocol 8.fully compatible with representational state transfer rest which allows creating stateless services 9.suitable for discrete systems for example for batch automation process disadvantages 1.service synchronization keeping services synchronized in a cooperative way 2.difficult to find systematic problems for example finding a problem in a chain of business activities when there is a logical error in the process is more difficult and the process requires to combine several log files into one piece 3.automated deployment and discovery is a must when the number of microservices is more than a few 4.difficult to find the right service granularity which can lead the entire system into instability due to overwhelmed network communication and error rations 5.challenging when the entire system is not discrete enough like continues process control 6.developing an automated test is significant difficult than monolithic systems following are a set of articles that published about microservices in code-project you can read and comment on your questions if you like

this is a result for a responsive bootstrap4 carousel on mobile and tablet but when the screens width is more than 676px the screens width is no longer a carousel


54113686
tunnel	packets
Pattern(s): 7	
unfortunately there is a problem with this setup the mtu of the tunnel is smaller than the mtu of the network so the traffic s not guaranteed that you can replay all the packets

temp	tmp
Pattern(s): 0	
this gives the following strategy try environment variables first xdg_cache_home if this s nonempty this s a posix system with xdg conventions then tmp if this s nonempty this s a posix system and you don t have a better option than tmp anyway finally temp in case this s windows


54148360
range	max
Pattern(s): 7	
say you now want 0..9 so you modulo by 10 and now your upper part has a range 0..4294967 42949672 100 as max is less than 16m we can now bring in the next byte


54182659
filewriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 7	
bufferedwriter has a better buffer writing implementation than filewriter performance wise unless prompt output is required prompt output is advisable to wrap a bufferedwriter around any writer whose write operations may be costly such as filewriters and outputstreamwriters


54189372
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
so when moving right or down just ensure the values don t grow larger than the width or height of the window -- minus the width and height of the image of course since the position is from the top-left


54208581
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
and for what it s worth when you re iterating over an arrays a for-loop is a better fit because a for-loop allows you to define the iteration variable the condition and the increment all in one place


54209428
temp	junction
Pattern(s): 10	
it was explicitly typed as an integer in the code i saw so presumably it s central to ensuring the algorithm works didn t change became didn t change became this time the condition containing the junction reads in english as if temp is less than or equal to both acu and acu times value


54218098
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
what this observation by roy fielding helped me http does not attempt to require the results of a get to be safe does is require that the semantics of the operation be safe and therefore the operation is a fault of the implementation not the interface or the user of that interface if anything happens as a result that causes loss of property patch has stricter semantics than post


54249552
uibutton	uiappearance
Pattern(s): 7	
updated answer for swift 4.2 working with uiappearance is a cleaner way of solving the problem but the problem would cause all the uibutton to have a clear text


54320786
raft	paxos
Pattern(s): 0	
this behavior is why tcp exists because each individual packet can go through separate routes between servers and there is a high chance of out-of-order messages and most applications prefer the ease-of-mind of a strict ordering other protocols such as plain old paxos can work with out-of-order messages but are typically much slower than raft

you may be familiar with the group aesthetics from plotting lines and polygons but in gganimate the group aesthetics takes a more central place


54543097
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
whereas in python a for-loop is more of a for each loops - you give -loop an iterable object and -loop runs the code for every item in that iterable object


54544226
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
the conda documentation explicitly mentions this issue in the conda documentation troubleshooting documentation conda upgrade error cause downgrading conda from 4.6.1 to 4.5.x and then trying to conda install conda or conda upgrade conda will produce a solving and upgrade error similar to the following solving environment failed condaupgradeerror this environment has previously been operated on by a conda versioning that s newer than the conda currently being used


54615358
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 10	
if you want to re-run expo build then you ll need to upgrade from sdk 25 preferably to sdk 32 so you won you want to re-run expo build need to update again for a while and also because each expo versioning is better than the last

int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
if it takes more than 2 chars to print out an int it will print out two asterisks instead


54758938
subtraction	addition
Pattern(s): 0	0	
the third is that there is an operation that is much better than addition subtraction for cryptographic purposes xor or - the beauty of which is that it is it own inverse


54793739
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
the results are clearly visible here you can see that although google-chrome and firefox are rendering the stripe slightly differently google-chrome is antialiasing google-chrome and firefox are rendering the stripe slightly differently google-chrome correctly so google-chrome and firefox are rendering the stripe slightly differently google-chrome looks much smoother than google-chrome and firefox are rendering the stripe slightly differently google-chrome did before

min	max	min	median	median	max
Pattern(s): 0	
this will move the bottom quarter of the values to the top call quart again to find the quartile of the new values which will be the median of the original values iterate through the array and subtract max - min + 1 from all values greater than the max to return the array to the max original state you might need some additional rules to handle special cases if there are multiple values equal to the quartile

you can do the list using append with a while loops but the for-loop is less error-prone i think


55187150
range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
your program is creating a range of numbers between 1 and 19 range go to one less than the max number you specify like your program is initializing the variable total to equal 0 for i in a you start looping through the range you made earlier the first iteration the next and so on until you are selecting only the data where the modulo of 5 or 3 is 0

decimal	ieee
Pattern(s): 0	
above number.max_safe_integer for example its precision is less than 0 decimal places to convert a number to a string with a fixed number of decimal places use .tofixed as epascarello suggested as for doing financial calculations some say you should never use ieee 754 floats such as javascript s number s although many of the largest companies in finance do just that


55255372
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
3 one way is rounding your double value before you use this int initalizer from this double will be passed for int initializer to one decimal place and then round result by following rule for this purpose you can use rounded method with floatingpointroundingrule .tonearestorawayfromzero which is default value for this parameter also you can use failable initalizer since if double is bigger then int can be code crashes


55349844
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 7	7	
because the size of unsigned short is smaller than the size of int when comparing a value of 0xffff to eof the unsigned short 0xffff will be converted to an int with a value of 0x0000ffff extra digits shown for clarity

in practice this method is not fundamentally different from your multiplying by a large prime approach but in this case the factor is chosen more carefully and the fact that sometimes more than 1 multiplication is required adding to the apparent randomness


55402738
super	extends
Pattern(s): 0	
in airflow source repo one word of caution due to the way logging multiprocessing and airflow default handlers interact it is safer to override handler methods than to extends handler methods by calling super in a derived handler class

if the scalarformatter object calls that function any number less than 10 min or greater than 10 max will be expressed in scientific notation


55438173
ionic	angular
Pattern(s): 2	
ionic vs cordova first of all i would recommend starting with ionic because its better to have with some ui widgets to start with rather than a blank screen cordova and to start from scratch hybrid apps these are not native apps but rather use webviews browser built-in your app to display your views coded in html and fetch user input and then use javascript or angular etc to process these


55441008

a more common approach with cron for this is by simply adding multiple cron jobs and imposing an increasing delay on each of multiple cron jobs


55472342
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 10	
another thing is in the event where you re not actually messing with the internals of layers is to just use keras which is much more straightforward to use for the layman than tensorflow and this sits on top of tensorflow so you re using the same tech


55489356
switching	screens

interpolation	splines
Pattern(s): 7	
i think you re using few values for the interpolation by changing to i get the following and changint the splines degree to i get the following i think a good starting point for the interpolation could be n 2 and as the interpolation presents less data deformation


55644267
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
an example which shows this using some random data i generated it before you added the data is this will produce the easiest way to fix this though this does not fix the underlying data and won t work in all cases is simply to set the limits manually to account for the offset - which will give you if you want to include the months lower than the minimum 0 1 2 you can set the xticks and xticklabels manually - ax.set_xticks range -3 9 ax.set_xticklabels range 0 12 which will give you

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
if this method does not apply there is a fallback a couple lines later again using a simple for-loop index is set earlier already used for calling the methods mentioned above what is big o of all javascript object method specially keys values object is in the neighboring to arrays runtime file but do not expect magic there either magic also ends up in various for loops in like a simple one checking if an arrays is built of valid keys numbers and strings or another one called from various places to build a single collection from multiple sources big o 1 is said to be constant time but what is exact time in terms of ms there is no such thing


55678298
min	max

55759019
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 10	
you can check if it is inside the words the important line is this we have 3 rules for 3 rules to count the puntuation p is in the words 2 the words w does not start by the punctuation p the words w does not ends by the punctuation p a more pythonic way of doing such would be to use the str available methods endswith and startswith .. if p in w and not w.startswith p and not w.endswith p ...


55777360
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	0	
it is important to note that for a min heap the minimum element is the root so instead of having all parent bigger than all parent children it becomes all children bigger than all parent parent


55838662
memcpy	strcpy
Pattern(s): 10	8	
if source_str is certain to point to a properly-terminated c string of no more than length - 1 characters and if it is it string value that you want to copy then strcpy is more natural than memcpy


55894855
width	margin
Pattern(s): 0	
of course you need first to check there is enough place before to write a word supposing the separator are only spaces all the separators are produced even consecutively or at the beginning of a line in case a word is longer than the width a word is not cut case of azeryuiop in the execution later a proposal from your code where the program receives in argument the left margin the width and the string compilation and execution


55912265
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 7	
despite a list with those names and indexes might work i believe a dictionary is semantically better for this case because a dictionary job is to map a key value relation


55941319
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this remains true even if the width is much longer than the height and where this becomes tempting to speak about lengths and widths


55955979
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
firefox seems google-chrome is simply more lenient


56004461
filewriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 10	
wrap your filewriter in a bufferedwriter that way you can use the writer.newline method an additional benefit is that a bufferedwriter is more efficient then using the filewriter directly


56050896
range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
use intersect and do a binary search the above should work for any arbitrary range and a binary search does not iterate through the entire range nor does a binary search use cells.count which can raise an error if there are more cells than the max value for a long integer


56063552
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
while asking the question i wondered if checking the height and width of both parent and child would work out and decrease the fontsize until the height and width of child is not bigger than the height and width of the parent and it seems like it actually did work out


56093696
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the warning is not issued if signed integer is of larger size than the unsigned integer in this case the unsigned integer is converted to larger signed integer and fits into positive range of the larger type


56141684
virtualenv	conda
Pattern(s): 7	
also conda can has larger control over the environment and can for example have a different version of python installed inside of conda virtualenv - only the python available in the system


56154464
post	put
Pattern(s): 10	
post should work in all cases put is probably more intuitive to typical updates done in web forms while patching would require your client to actually calculate the steps needed to transform the current resource representation to the desired one if you use application json-patch+json in particular


56171017
128bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
decodes to a pure load uop on intel cpus no alu uop needed so it has 2 per clock throughput instead of 1 old cpus like merom and k8 have slow shuffle units that are only 64bit wide so shufps is pretty slow because it s a full 128bit shuffle with granularity smaller than 64bit


56210331
cout	cin
Pattern(s): 7	7	
to have the function more equivalent to the java version change your c++ main to note that by default c++ s console i o iostream cin cout is even slower than o iostream cin cout could be because syncronization with c s console i o stdio scanf printf is enabled to let a program not do weird things if both cout and printf are used here you can read about cout s performance when synchronization is turned off

punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 0	
this adds words s to a buffer until your conditions are met words contains punctuation and a buffer is longer than 7 words


56258932
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
except it is theoretically possible that int is wider than uint64_t in which case the arithmetic would be done with int but that is still satisfactory performing a cast guarantees the arithmetic will be done with at least that width for real numbers the usual arithmetic conversions are largely if either operand is long double the other is converted to long double


56261712
ionic	angular
Pattern(s): 10	
there is a more updated fork of this plugin available at you could probably use ionic native for angular which gives a more angular like api otherwise you should be able to work with filechooser directly as this is the js object that is added to the global scope make sure to wait for the deviceready event before trying to access the deviceready event

maybe them were generated with a version of vtk that is more recent than the one used for your version of paraview


56303590
distance	polygons
Pattern(s): 0	
use intersection area minus non-common area as a metric of similarity shapely can be used for that non-common area is union - intersection or simply symmetric difference final metric intersection.area - symmetric_difference.area intersection area this approach might be better than processing distance in some situations for example you want to prefer fewer points covering whole area over huge amount of very close points that cover only half of that non-common area only half of the area s more obvious way to compare candidates with different number of points but only half of the area has only half of the area s disadvantages too just draw some examples on paper and experiment to find them other ideas instead of using polygons or concave hull you can build a linear ring from your points and then use contour.buffer some_distance


56306602
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
this function returns true if there are one or less items in the arrays the arrays doesn t pass the condition in the for-loop if there is more than one item in the arrays there is more than one item in the arrays will check the value there is more than one item in the arrays is iterating over with the previous one

it will be quicker than pandas method dask write function will break your file into mulitple chuncks and store mulitple chuncks


56362987
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
in s is a wrong format because you write a chars not a string out of that the natural type for an index is size_t not int use size_t for both i and len and in that case change the loop to use index without supposing it can be negative if the input string has more than 19 chars scanf will write out of word with an undefined behavior limit the size using the format 19s 19 rather than 20 to have the place for the ending null chars word is an array do not use a to give the ending null chars word address in scanf check the result of scanf if you want to detect eof flush the output writing a newline after the loop so a possible way is


56386276
atoi	malloc	strtol	atoi
Pattern(s): 0	
as a matter of good habit a diagnostic message s also better to check the return value of the malloc also strtol is better than atoi as the former provides error checking


56393506
alloca	malloc
Pattern(s): 7	0	
alloca is worse than malloc because alloca causes unpredictable stack usage and can lead to a stack overflow which won t be detected at all or which will only be detected by a program crash


56443598
median	minimum
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you can solve it using divide and conquer approach find a random element in between the minimum and maximum check if it s median if the median is lower or higher than the median and reduce the problem to a smaller size only on a subrange of the array


56451549
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
you can set max-width 100 on children to keep children from growing wider than the parent s width


56478993
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 10	
if we re just going to cast to the expected type we could use  a dictionary of getter with the property name as the key would look like this to store the getter for a property propertyinfo discovered by reflection storing setter is more complicated

Pattern(s): 3	
i anyway recommend learning dplyr many bugs i could not figure out in your sqldf code s the standard others programmers also use


56523368
pyenv	virtualenv
Pattern(s): 3	
i would highly recommend using pyenv to manage multiple verions of python and pyenv makes switching between they really easy both locally and globally and use pyenv in combination with a virtualenv per project you are working on


56582186
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if there are less than this it will create more if there are more than this it will terminate some according to the termination policy oldest first newest first etc min and max define boundaries on desired count - desired will never be less than min or more than max


56583626
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays

using a foreach loops is somewhat easier than using a for-loop as the delegate eliminates the need for an index variable and an indexed arrays access


56587249
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you likely have some versioning of requests installed that is at least 2.10.0 but you can check with the following if your installed versioning is less than 2.10.0 upgrade with proxy configuration according to the linked answer we set up a dict of we proxy using https in place of http because all of praw s requests happen over https we then have to pass this to the session that praw uses


56662732
free	malloc
Pattern(s): 3	
because system calls are costly your standard library will try to avoid system calls and prefer marking free -d memory zones as reusable in future malloc -s


56672107
equals	gethashcode
Pattern(s): 7	
a correct answer will depend on what type the key and value parts are if one of the key and value parts is a for example the equals comparison is trickier but in general assuming that all the keys and values have all the keys and values equals and gethashcode methods implemented correctly we can use the system.linq extension methods any and except to get the result


56721826
inherited	properties
Pattern(s): 10	
this is the real form of inherited built into javascript and the foo properties is missing in all the objects composing the entire prototype chain then the value undefined is returned s the business which really seats behind the es6 class keywork which is a convenience which hides this mess and gives you the impression that javascript has a form of class inherited class inherited is more widely known and most of programmers find it easier to think of than prototypal inherited

range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
better compression with range constraints adding a self-imposed constraint partitions are sorted from largest to lowest part we can deduce for p in parts num size max constraints 2 3 can be applied recursively to all by noting that is in therefore we can compute better imin imax and inject better imin imax in the previous implementation live demo todo sanity checks the provided implementations can go into undefined behaviour if the partition is not sorted or the partition index is not valid

superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 7	
the constructor in the subclassing doesn t have to match the one in superclass but it should call it using super .. subclassing should provide a constructor that calls super . like this or even this superclass has more than one explicit constructor subclassing are forced to provide at least one constructor that calls any of the superclass s constructors subclassing could be any of the following or or or any combination of those constructors

integer	fractions
Pattern(s): 0	
they first find the best solution with fractions values for the variables number of steps then successively divide the allowed region into smaller sections with integer edges and eventually stop when they find the best solution at an edge

gam	mgcv
Pattern(s): 0	
just giving the sampling weights to mgcv gam won t do either of gam treats the weights as frequency weights and so will think gam has a lot more data than gam actually has


56959567
cstring	bstr
Pattern(s): 8	
about allocsysstring cstringw servicenamew servicename creates a copy in bstr they re more complex than cstring they re null-terminated too but they also have length at negative offset

disk	ram
Pattern(s): 7	
it has nothing in common with selenium you need to get a snapshot of what s going on with your operating system when you launch the browser for example using windows performance monitor blind shot chrome browser is very memory intensive you can check how much ram it consumes using windows task manager and if your machine is short on ram your machine starts intensively using page file to store some memory pages to disk and since disk is much slower comparing to the ram - you re getting inconsistent results


56999051
nullreferenceexception	objectdisposedexception
Pattern(s): 7	
sure ideally you d want an objectdisposedexception out of an object which has been disposed when something attempts to access any of this practice s functions but in place of that a nullreferenceexception is better than no exception at all


57010562
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
the query also makes little sens to check both for an id to be greater than minimum less than maximum and within that range


57032106
multiplying	division	multiplying	multiplication	division	multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	10	
this explains why you are not seeing multiplication as faster than division when timing with instead let s write setup code which performs multiplication and division on random numbers yields on my machine multiplying is faster 99.00 of the time


57062091
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
this will hide any children that would overflow an elements height when less than this children 1 the reason the bg color is in between is because you set the background color of the parent element


57073230
sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 0	
and in case of how many times the input size is executed then bubble sort is executed up to o n 2 distribution sort grouping more than one sorting alghorithm but there is no sorting faster than ps if this comes from high school professor there is good chance this comes from high school professor does not have full understanding of complexity theory either

uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
the issue may also turn into an install problem when the uninstall runs as part of a major upgrade that requires the older versioning to be removed first


57153085
rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
Pattern(s): 0	0	
dsa in general s slower than rsa and ecdsa dsa in general has more perfect or broken states than rsa and dsa in general key generation is several orders of magnitude slower than rsa and ecdsa


57174465
16-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 7	
rax is the total 64bit eax is the lower 32 bits ax is the lower 16-bit ah represents the h igh 8 bits of ax al represents the l ow 8 bits of ax therefore if your 64bit register contains a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7 eax e4f5a6b7 ax a6b7 ah a6 al b7 you can identify this visually very easily by opening the windows calculator and setting this to programmer mode hexadecimal mode and a qword value


57244204
superclass	subclassing
Pattern(s): 0	
as described in the above diagram we have here a superclass called animal which has three subclassing mammal bird and fish some animals share common behavior a cat and a dove can both walk but the cat cannot fly these kinds of behavior are orthogonal to this classification so we cannot implements these behavior in the superclasses if a class could have more than one superclass it would be easy we could create three other classes walker swimmer flyer


57259652
swift	objective-c
Pattern(s): 0	
swift does not make swift code accessible to objective-c by default to avoid making its code larger than swift needs to be


57325379
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	7	
in scrollviewer scrolling only when the content width height is larger than the container width height but the internal viewable area of the scrollviewer is infinite so if you want the child scrollviewer to work you need to set the width height for the child


57332156
scylla	cassandra
Pattern(s): 2	
details here given your use case if you envision storing multiple tb of data i would recommend scylla over cassandra


57386013
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
your image component is actual vertically bottom set backgroundcolor and you ll see your image component but as the actual image not image component will resize to fit the image componenti in this case because of width is bigger height so the image will verticaly center inside image component you need either set resizemode cover or change abosolute property top bottom


57386889
subtract	add
Pattern(s): 10	
attempt 2 check whether adding or subtract is better with two bits of information start x01 add x10 divide x1 add x+1 0 divide x+1 4 operations subtract x0 divide x 4 operations subtract x00 divide x0 divide x 3 operations add x+1 possibly not optimal 4 operations conclusion for x01 subtract will result in at least as few operations as adding 3 and 4 operations versus 4 and 4 operations to reach x and x+1


57501764
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 3	
also i recommend using setter and getter and making your class variables private rather than making setter and getter public


57530075
setinterval	settimeout
Pattern(s): 3	
i prefer using settimeout and call the function object each time when needed that way you don t need a global variable to maintain the value returned by setinterval


57708587
move	drag
Pattern(s): 3	
read more here i would recommend using drag and drop feature to move files into xcode

width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
anything outside of the svg will not be visible so if those coordinates are greater than the width or height of the svg your circle will appear outside of the svg bounds


57737953
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
your form should be this you should use post method when you re creating a something new this is safer than using get method
