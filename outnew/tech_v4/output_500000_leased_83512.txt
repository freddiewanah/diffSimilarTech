realloc	malloc
Pattern(s): 7	0	
if no storage is allocated or deallocated between the malloc and realloc the size of the realloc is known when the malloc is performed and the realloc size is larger than the malloc size then the malloc may make sense to consolidate the malloc and realloc operations into a single larger allocation


53402575
fgets	getline
Pattern(s): 0	
yes it s possible to use fgets and fputs  if you re using posix systems you might find getline better than fgets but you d still use fputs with d


53428643
react-router	styled-components
Pattern(s): 7	
if react-router is less than v4 try inline style if you want to use styled-components you could do something like this or you can do styled-components with navlink in react-router v4


53449894
robocopy	xcopy
Pattern(s): 7	
as hans passant pointed out in a comment xcopy d is an easier solution it is- and if no other properties or parameters of robocopy are useful this could be preferred


53488438
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 8	
my issue is a duplicate and the answer to my question was given by stefan-peshikj in turns out google-chrome and safari are more permissive than firefox which doesn t accept an turn url with username not accepted accepted this solves my issue


53501759
range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
the max values of the rgb channels are lower than that of the n channel but look at the mean values of the rgb channels the max values of the rgb channels are much smaller than max 2 you have a high dynamic range hdr image here and want to compress its high range to 8 bits for displaying


53522619
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
firefox is more likely that there is a cached redirect in google-chrome which causes firefox to visit a former redirect target directly without visiting the original url


53522806
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	
the long contour is considered a line if a line width is much longer than a line height or a line aspect ratio is large such as 8 and you need also to optimize this value finally you should get something like that


53526459
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
int is in your case probably 4 times bigger than chars resulting in looping over whole of your data structure of type chars 4 times quicker as you expected


53545862
sorting	grouping
Pattern(s): 7	
the first solution likely will be faster with smaller list of dicts since the sorting is easier but you would need to test that it is not required in the solution that i gave that the keys be grouping the keys is required for groupby to work


53602775
bower	npm
Pattern(s): 3	
but during npm install -g bower i saw warning npm warn deprecated bower 1.8.4 bower don t recommend using bower for new projects


53606328
int	chars
Pattern(s): 8	
500-599 for errors rejections i prefer this to simple int and while this can be less descriptive than chars this can also be less ambiguous


53606554
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
as you mentioned in your question geckodriver firefox combination is faster then chromedriver google-chrome at this point geckodriver firefox combination is worth to mention that diferent browsers render the html dom in a different way


53613333
median	minimum
Pattern(s): 10	
that is because we have the same amount of elements at both side but the median value is closer to the minimum thus there should be elements with smaller difference between both side


53655952
sys	argparse
Pattern(s): 7	
copy-paste from official python documentation import getopt sys official documentation is here for tutorials see for example on the other hand argparse is easier if you like to get the other hand argparse done in an easier but not c-like way


53681490
int	boolean
Pattern(s): 7	
i made some minor changes -use enum instead of 4 boolean makes cleaner code -do not use me.refresh it s slow and does things you do not need here -it s better to use not two int lists but one point list hope it helps


53689487
setsid	pty
Pattern(s): 7	
setsid is easier and it is usually preferable to have the child run in a new process group anyway as the child and the child children can be sent a signal without affecting any other processes now whenever a process that has no controlling terminal opens a terminal device a tty or a pty that device will become device controlling terminal unless the o_noctty flag was used when opening the device


53718638
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
can you verify your nss versioning in your machines using  incase your nss versioning is lower than 3.23 you might need to upgrade your nss versioning


53756837
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	
and while pwa s work on android through firefox and opera only google-chrome has proper standalone support


53782234
post	get
Pattern(s): 10	
try to send your request as post method you don t see get requests with the body very often and that s why post is more secure the body s never cached and most importantly there s no size limit maybe that s the reason cause your get request is not working


53813887
pandas	astropy
Pattern(s): 8	
python s collection.counter is an easy way to get the answer here to do python s collection.counter with astropy one way would be to add a column of 1 that you can then aggregate but this is probably less flexible than pandas as i think that the aggregate function must be applied to all columns


53845615
flask	django
Pattern(s): 0	
if in fact you just need a web api wrapper flask is probably a much better choice than django simply because django is huge and you d be using only a fraction of fact capability


53907705
int	chars	unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 0	
be warned that the standard requires all operations on types smaller than int to be implicitly converted in the c abstract machine to int or unsigned int if the standard won t fit in an int and then converted again back to the original _bool chars or short


53908617
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
you should first initialize those variables to the first element in the array and then loop the rest of the array starting with and updating the values of min and max only if the current element is lower or higher respectively than min and max


53909735
children	parent
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you can rely on element.getboundingclientrect for both parent and child and set a private property on children if children .bottom is bigger than the parent s pun intended


53924864
width	height
Pattern(s): 10	
let s add some border and we will clearly see what is happening as you can see the nested sticky elements are both having both width equal to parent width since both are block element so there is no room for the left-sticky to have any sticky behavior 1 since it has width 100 unlike the top one that can still stick because it height is less that the parent height


53928702
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this condition should be because when width is bigger than height we calculate and set measure dimension base on width not height


53943481
debian	linux
Pattern(s): 10	
i recommend installing and using some linux distribution in particular because debian sid is more developer friendly and provides valgrind which is very useful to hunt bugs


53965792
gdi	direct2d
Pattern(s): 7	
gdi functions have limited transparency support so you might want to use a different technology like direct2d which has better integration with the gpu


54042498
folder	directory
Pattern(s): 7	
we got an error because we have missing vendor folder in we project the vendor directory contains we composer dependencies


54063403
orchestration	microservices	stateless	stateful
Pattern(s): 7	
advantages 1.decentralized and decoupled architecture using choreography rather than orchestration makes services publish-subscribe based and as a result fully decentralized 2.do one thing and do it well unix philosophy more focused and singular with very narrow functionality 3.easy to have parallelism and load balancing because of being more fine-grained from the business process point of view 4.statelessness however having a stateful microservices is valid but it is not the ideal 5.individual data storage makes services relaxed to keep tracing the data-flow 6.easy and automated deployment and discovery due to use of container engine-based technologies such as docker 7.more interoperability which makes services able to have more flexibility in accepting dropping a new current service or protocol 8.fully compatible with representational state transfer rest which allows creating stateless services 9.suitable for discrete systems for example for batch automation process disadvantages 1.service synchronization keeping services synchronized in a cooperative way 2.difficult to find systematic problems for example finding a problem in a chain of business activities when there is a logical error in the process is more difficult and the process requires to combine several log files into one piece 3.automated deployment and discovery is a must when the number of microservices is more than a few 4.difficult to find the right service granularity which can lead the entire system into instability due to overwhelmed network communication and error rations 5.challenging when the entire system is not discrete enough like continues process control 6.developing an automated test is significant difficult than monolithic systems following are a set of articles that published about microservices in code-project you can read and comment on your questions if you like


54079224
screens	tablet
Pattern(s): 7	10	
this is a result for a responsive bootstrap4 carousel on mobile and tablet but when the screens width is more than 676px the screens width is no longer a carousel


54113686
tunnel	packets
Pattern(s): 7	
unfortunately there is a problem with this setup the mtu of the tunnel is smaller than the mtu of the network so the traffic s not guaranteed that you can replay all the packets


54147944
temp	tmp
Pattern(s): 0	
this gives the following strategy try environment variables first xdg_cache_home if this s nonempty this s a posix system with xdg conventions then tmp if this s nonempty this s a posix system and you don t have a better option than tmp anyway finally temp in case this s windows


54148360
range	max
Pattern(s): 7	
say you now want 0..9 so you modulo by 10 and now your upper part has a range 0..4294967 42949672 100 as max is less than 16m we can now bring in the next byte


54182659
filewriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 7	
bufferedwriter has a better buffer writing implementation than filewriter performance wise unless prompt output is required prompt output is advisable to wrap a bufferedwriter around any writer whose write operations may be costly such as filewriters and outputstreamwriters


54189372
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
so when moving right or down just ensure the values don t grow larger than the width or height of the window -- minus the width and height of the image of course since the position is from the top-left


54208581
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
and for what it s worth when you re iterating over an arrays a for-loop is a better fit because a for-loop allows you to define the iteration variable the condition and the increment all in one place


54209428
temp	junction
Pattern(s): 10	
it was explicitly typed as an integer in the code i saw so presumably it s central to ensuring the algorithm works didn t change became didn t change became this time the condition containing the junction reads in english as if temp is less than or equal to both acu and acu times value


54218098
post	get
Pattern(s): 0	
what this observation by roy fielding helped me http does not attempt to require the results of a get to be safe does is require that the semantics of the operation be safe and therefore the operation is a fault of the implementation not the interface or the user of that interface if anything happens as a result that causes loss of property patch has stricter semantics than post


54249552
uibutton	uiappearance
Pattern(s): 7	
updated answer for swift 4.2 working with uiappearance is a cleaner way of solving the problem but the problem would cause all the uibutton to have a clear text


54320786
raft	paxos
Pattern(s): 0	
this behavior is why tcp exists because each individual packet can go through separate routes between servers and there is a high chance of out-of-order messages and most applications prefer the ease-of-mind of a strict ordering other protocols such as plain old paxos can work with out-of-order messages but are typically much slower than raft


54418167
put	get
Pattern(s): 7	
for all the others the value of data those could get is much less than the work those would have to put in getting it


54460199
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 7	
if you are seeing similar error on google-chrome on ubuntu the reason is probably you have a pre-installed version of google-chrome and firefox which is older


54483232
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 7	
loose the tf.reset_default_graph and you should be good as for the memory leaks be sure you are running keras 2.2.4 and preferably tensorflow 1.10 has better keras integration i had a similar issue with keras 2.2.2 crashing when loading multiple models in sequence and a similar issue with keras disapeared after i updated to keras 2.2.4


54506912
aesthetics	gganimate
Pattern(s): 10	
you may be familiar with the group aesthetics from plotting lines and polygons but in gganimate the group aesthetics takes a more central place


54543097
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 7	
whereas in python a for-loop is more of a for each loops - you give -loop an iterable object and -loop runs the code for every item in that iterable object


54544226
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	
the conda documentation explicitly mentions this issue in the conda documentation troubleshooting documentation conda upgrade error cause downgrading conda from 4.6.1 to 4.5.x and then trying to conda install conda or conda upgrade conda will produce a solving and upgrade error similar to the following solving environment failed condaupgradeerror this environment has previously been operated on by a conda versioning that s newer than the conda currently being used


54615358
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 10	
if you want to re-run expo build then you ll need to upgrade from sdk 25 preferably to sdk 32 so you won you want to re-run expo build need to update again for a while and also because each expo versioning is better than the last


54642546
xlsx	xlsm
Pattern(s): 10	
if you were to do this manually by going to file saveas to save an xlsm as an xlsx and clicking yes to continue saving as a macro-free workbook you d see that an xlsm is no longer open only the new xlsx is


54670378
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
in cases where the sum of children s flex-grow value is less than 1 children s will not fill the entire parent s width and only the corresponding fraction instead


54681767
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
if it takes more than 2 chars to print out an int it will print out two asterisks instead


54758938
subtraction	addition
Pattern(s): 0	0	
the third is that there is an operation that is much better than addition subtraction for cryptographic purposes xor or - the beauty of which is that it is it own inverse


54793739
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 0	
the results are clearly visible here you can see that although google-chrome and firefox are rendering the stripe slightly differently google-chrome is antialiasing google-chrome and firefox are rendering the stripe slightly differently google-chrome correctly so google-chrome and firefox are rendering the stripe slightly differently google-chrome looks much smoother than google-chrome and firefox are rendering the stripe slightly differently google-chrome did before


54873757
16-bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
although depending how your inputs were written using 32-bit xor could be better than 16-bit xor maybe avoiding partial-register stalls if something later reads the full 32 or 64bit registers


54894124
folder	dir
Pattern(s): 10	
for exemple run your docker image with a volume maaping between you host folder and a temp folder docker run -v host empty dir some-temp-folder -it myimage copy your container folder with code files content into some-temp-folder to fill you host folder with you container folder run you container with a volum mapping on host empty dir but now container folder is no longer empty run -v host empty dir container folder with code files -it myimage note that steps 1 2 may be replaced by copying files from docker container to host


55010039
int	chars
Pattern(s): 7	
dividing an unsigned chars by another unsigned chars is faster than divisions involving unsigned int


55031207
fftw	fftpack	pyfftw	fftpack
Pattern(s): 10	
pyfftw wrapping the fftw library is likely faster than the fftpack library wrapped by np.fft and scipy.fftpack  after all fftw stands for fastest fourier transform in the west


55050926
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	
what happens when you assign that to bit_flag depends on the type of that variable but if bit_flag is an integer type that is either unsigned or has more than 7 value bits then the assignment is well-defined and value-preserving


55066530
lxml	beautifulsoup
Pattern(s): 10	
ok beautifulsoup seems way better than raw lxml for that purpose this code works pretty well edit this code is important to use html.parser


55094783
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
Pattern(s): 7	
if your app uses #2 javascript events you can use a workaround triggering the mouseover mouseout events manually cy.get .menu.button.overlay_button.projects_popover .click cy.contains automation .trigger mouseover cy.contains shots .trigger mouseover .click there is also a possibility your app is listening to the mouseenter mouseleave events in which case you can trigger those as well


55152348
min	max	min	median	median	max
Pattern(s): 0	
this will move the bottom quarter of the values to the top call quart again to find the quartile of the new values which will be the median of the original values iterate through the array and subtract max - min + 1 from all values greater than the max to return the array to the max original state you might need some additional rules to handle special cases if there are multiple values equal to the quartile


55171000
for-loop	loops
Pattern(s): 10	
you can do the list using append with a while loops but the for-loop is less error-prone i think


55187150
range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
your program is creating a range of numbers between 1 and 19 range go to one less than the max number you specify like your program is initializing the variable total to equal 0 for i in a you start looping through the range you made earlier the first iteration the next and so on until you are selecting only the data where the modulo of 5 or 3 is 0


55190576
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 10	
however if you really need to use maven for that you might use the following pom.xml this is more ore less an equivalent of the build.gradle file


55193139
decimal	ieee
Pattern(s): 0	
above number.max_safe_integer for example its precision is less than 0 decimal places to convert a number to a string with a fixed number of decimal places use .tofixed as epascarello suggested as for doing financial calculations some say you should never use ieee 754 floats such as javascript s number s although many of the largest companies in finance do just that


55255372
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
3 one way is rounding your double value before you use this int initalizer from this double will be passed for int initializer to one decimal place and then round result by following rule for this purpose you can use rounded method with floatingpointroundingrule .tonearestorawayfromzero which is default value for this parameter also you can use failable initalizer since if double is bigger then int can be code crashes


55349844
unsigned	short
Pattern(s): 7	7	
because the size of unsigned short is smaller than the size of int when comparing a value of 0xffff to eof the unsigned short 0xffff will be converted to an int with a value of 0x0000ffff extra digits shown for clarity


55350701
maven	pom.xml
Pattern(s): 7	
you can configure the deploy plugin to provide the maven coordinates more information can be found here and the file name definition with in the pom.xml itself and invoke the pom.xml itself to the install phase maven profile should be helpful in achieving this task


55362209
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 0	
if it s less than versioning 236 and you can t don t want to upgrade you could simply update your execstart line to ...then put back the standardoutput line back to the default


55364441
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	0	
similar to martin prikryl s answer in order to deal with different dpi settings and placing a bitmap setup your machine to 100 dpi make a bitmap with size width height to fit on your innosetup page form get these width and height right click properties on your bmp file use the code below setup your machine to 150 dpi and create your bitmap to fit for 150 dpi and use your machine instead the first one which fits for 100 dpi this way your machine will look nice for 100 and for 200 the code change 544 with the width of your bitmap and 211 with the height of your bitmap from step 3 stretch true does the bitmap to expand if 3 stretch true is smaller or shrink if 3 stretch true is bigger than width height properties p.s


55379435
multiplying	multiplication
Pattern(s): 0	
in practice this method is not fundamentally different from your multiplying by a large prime approach but in this case the factor is chosen more carefully and the fact that sometimes more than 1 multiplication is required adding to the apparent randomness


55402738
super	extends
Pattern(s): 0	
in airflow source repo one word of caution due to the way logging multiprocessing and airflow default handlers interact it is safer to override handler methods than to extends handler methods by calling super in a derived handler class


55425057
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if the scalarformatter object calls that function any number less than 10 min or greater than 10 max will be expressed in scientific notation


55438173
ionic	angular
Pattern(s): 2	
ionic vs cordova first of all i would recommend starting with ionic because its better to have with some ui widgets to start with rather than a blank screen cordova and to start from scratch hybrid apps these are not native apps but rather use webviews browser built-in your app to display your views coded in html and fetch user input and then use javascript or angular etc to process these


55441008
jobs	cron
Pattern(s): 8	
a more common approach with cron for this is by simply adding multiple cron jobs and imposing an increasing delay on each of multiple cron jobs


55472342
keras	tensorflow
Pattern(s): 10	
another thing is in the event where you re not actually messing with the internals of layers is to just use keras which is much more straightforward to use for the layman than tensorflow and this sits on top of tensorflow so you re using the same tech


55489356
switching	screens
Pattern(s): 0	
by default it does not handle back actions and it resets routes to actions default state when you switching away you can perform goback action inside goalstack if you have more than one screens


55525858
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
and only keeping the rotate transform so i m using flex i think grid will do too if the parent of the element would be smaller than the children i would use margin to position my child to center


55539068
hide	show
Pattern(s): 10	
i m not sure to understand the thing what do you want to do but if you want show and hide the content show s better like


55638494
hidapi	libusb
Pattern(s): 0	
that hidapi doesn t give you the same level of control over the packets you send s higher level than libusb and some of the parameters that that hidapi doesn t give you the same level of control over the packets you send uses for requests are fixed brequest value


55639793
interpolation	splines
Pattern(s): 7	
i think you re using few values for the interpolation by changing to i get the following and changint the splines degree to i get the following i think a good starting point for the interpolation could be n 2 and as the interpolation presents less data deformation


55644267
range	minimum
Pattern(s): 0	
an example which shows this using some random data i generated it before you added the data is this will produce the easiest way to fix this though this does not fix the underlying data and won t work in all cases is simply to set the limits manually to account for the offset - which will give you if you want to include the months lower than the minimum 0 1 2 you can set the xticks and xticklabels manually - ax.set_xticks range -3 9 ax.set_xticklabels range 0 12 which will give you


55646515
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
Pattern(s): 8	
the solution seems that google-chrome and firefox were more forgiving than safari


55676139
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 10	
if this method does not apply there is a fallback a couple lines later again using a simple for-loop index is set earlier already used for calling the methods mentioned above what is big o of all javascript object method specially keys values object is in the neighboring to arrays runtime file but do not expect magic there either magic also ends up in various for loops in like a simple one checking if an arrays is built of valid keys numbers and strings or another one called from various places to build a single collection from multiple sources big o 1 is said to be constant time but what is exact time in terms of ms there is no such thing


55678298
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	
i think this could be the reason the abs min returns a value that is 1 bigger than max of a certain type


55695676
simctl	xcrun
Pattern(s): 7	0	
to boot a simulator xcrun simctl boot iphone x a simulator will boot as a headless mode to make a simulator visible open -a simulator xcrun simctl boot is simpler than xcrun instruments -w


55759019
punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 10	
you can check if it is inside the words the important line is this we have 3 rules for 3 rules to count the puntuation p is in the words 2 the words w does not start by the punctuation p the words w does not ends by the punctuation p a more pythonic way of doing such would be to use the str available methods endswith and startswith .. if p in w and not w.startswith p and not w.endswith p ...


55777360
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	0	
it is important to note that for a min heap the minimum element is the root so instead of having all parent bigger than all parent children it becomes all children bigger than all parent parent


55838662
memcpy	strcpy
Pattern(s): 10	8	
if source_str is certain to point to a properly-terminated c string of no more than length - 1 characters and if it is it string value that you want to copy then strcpy is more natural than memcpy


55894855
width	margin
Pattern(s): 0	
of course you need first to check there is enough place before to write a word supposing the separator are only spaces all the separators are produced even consecutively or at the beginning of a line in case a word is longer than the width a word is not cut case of azeryuiop in the execution later a proposal from your code where the program receives in argument the left margin the width and the string compilation and execution


55912265
dictionary	map
Pattern(s): 7	
despite a list with those names and indexes might work i believe a dictionary is semantically better for this case because a dictionary job is to map a key value relation


55941319
width	height
Pattern(s): 7	0	
this remains true even if the width is much longer than the height and where this becomes tempting to speak about lengths and widths


55955979
google-chrome	firefox
Pattern(s): 10	
firefox seems google-chrome is simply more lenient


56004461
filewriter	bufferedwriter
Pattern(s): 10	
wrap your filewriter in a bufferedwriter that way you can use the writer.newline method an additional benefit is that a bufferedwriter is more efficient then using the filewriter directly


56050896
range	max
Pattern(s): 0	
use intersect and do a binary search the above should work for any arbitrary range and a binary search does not iterate through the entire range nor does a binary search use cells.count which can raise an error if there are more cells than the max value for a long integer


56063552
width	height
Pattern(s): 0	
while asking the question i wondered if checking the height and width of both parent and child would work out and decrease the fontsize until the height and width of child is not bigger than the height and width of the parent and it seems like it actually did work out


56093696
integer	unsigned
Pattern(s): 7	0	
the warning is not issued if signed integer is of larger size than the unsigned integer in this case the unsigned integer is converted to larger signed integer and fits into positive range of the larger type


56141684
virtualenv	conda
Pattern(s): 7	
also conda can has larger control over the environment and can for example have a different version of python installed inside of conda virtualenv - only the python available in the system


56154464
post	put
Pattern(s): 10	
post should work in all cases put is probably more intuitive to typical updates done in web forms while patching would require your client to actually calculate the steps needed to transform the current resource representation to the desired one if you use application json-patch+json in particular


56171017
128bit	64bit
Pattern(s): 0	
decodes to a pure load uop on intel cpus no alu uop needed so it has 2 per clock throughput instead of 1 old cpus like merom and k8 have slow shuffle units that are only 64bit wide so shufps is pretty slow because it s a full 128bit shuffle with granularity smaller than 64bit


56210331
cout	cin
Pattern(s): 7	7	
to have the function more equivalent to the java version change your c++ main to note that by default c++ s console i o iostream cin cout is even slower than o iostream cin cout could be because syncronization with c s console i o stdio scanf printf is enabled to let a program not do weird things if both cout and printf are used here you can read about cout s performance when synchronization is turned off

punctuation	words
Pattern(s): 0	
this adds words s to a buffer until your conditions are met words contains punctuation and a buffer is longer than 7 words


56258932
int	double
Pattern(s): 7	
except it is theoretically possible that int is wider than uint64_t in which case the arithmetic would be done with int but that is still satisfactory performing a cast guarantees the arithmetic will be done with at least that width for real numbers the usual arithmetic conversions are largely if either operand is long double the other is converted to long double


56261712
ionic	angular
Pattern(s): 10	
there is a more updated fork of this plugin available at you could probably use ionic native for angular which gives a more angular like api otherwise you should be able to work with filechooser directly as this is the js object that is added to the global scope make sure to wait for the deviceready event before trying to access the deviceready event

vtk	paraview
Pattern(s): 10	
maybe them were generated with a version of vtk that is more recent than the one used for your version of paraview


56303590
distance	polygons
Pattern(s): 0	
use intersection area minus non-common area as a metric of similarity shapely can be used for that non-common area is union - intersection or simply symmetric difference final metric intersection.area - symmetric_difference.area intersection area this approach might be better than processing distance in some situations for example you want to prefer fewer points covering whole area over huge amount of very close points that cover only half of that non-common area only half of the area s more obvious way to compare candidates with different number of points but only half of the area has only half of the area s disadvantages too just draw some examples on paper and experiment to find them other ideas instead of using polygons or concave hull you can build a linear ring from your points and then use contour.buffer some_distance


56306602
for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
this function returns true if there are one or less items in the arrays the arrays doesn t pass the condition in the for-loop if there is more than one item in the arrays there is more than one item in the arrays will check the value there is more than one item in the arrays is iterating over with the previous one


56352925
pandas	dask
Pattern(s): 0	
it will be quicker than pandas method dask write function will break your file into mulitple chuncks and store mulitple chuncks


56362987
int	chars
Pattern(s): 0	
in s is a wrong format because you write a chars not a string out of that the natural type for an index is size_t not int use size_t for both i and len and in that case change the loop to use index without supposing it can be negative if the input string has more than 19 chars scanf will write out of word with an undefined behavior limit the size using the format 19s 19 rather than 20 to have the place for the ending null chars word is an array do not use a to give the ending null chars word address in scanf check the result of scanf if you want to detect eof flush the output writing a newline after the loop so a possible way is


56386276
atoi	malloc	strtol	atoi
Pattern(s): 0	
as a matter of good habit a diagnostic message s also better to check the return value of the malloc also strtol is better than atoi as the former provides error checking


56393506
alloca	malloc
Pattern(s): 7	0	
alloca is worse than malloc because alloca causes unpredictable stack usage and can lead to a stack overflow which won t be detected at all or which will only be detected by a program crash


56443598
median	minimum
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you can solve it using divide and conquer approach find a random element in between the minimum and maximum check if it s median if the median is lower or higher than the median and reduce the problem to a smaller size only on a subrange of the array


56451549
children	parent
Pattern(s): 0	
you can set max-width 100 on children to keep children from growing wider than the parent s width


56478993
getter	setter
Pattern(s): 10	
if we re just going to cast to the expected type we could use  a dictionary of getter with the property name as the key would look like this to store the getter for a property propertyinfo discovered by reflection storing setter is more complicated


56505004
dplyr	sqldf
Pattern(s): 3	
i anyway recommend learning dplyr many bugs i could not figure out in your sqldf code s the standard others programmers also use


56523368
pyenv	virtualenv
Pattern(s): 3	
i would highly recommend using pyenv to manage multiple verions of python and pyenv makes switching between they really easy both locally and globally and use pyenv in combination with a virtualenv per project you are working on


56582186
min	max
Pattern(s): 0	0	
if there are less than this it will create more if there are more than this it will terminate some according to the termination policy oldest first newest first etc min and max define boundaries on desired count - desired will never be less than min or more than max


56583626
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
Pattern(s): 7	
using a foreach loops is somewhat easier than using a for-loop as the delegate eliminates the need for an index variable and an indexed arrays access


56587249
versioning	upgrade
Pattern(s): 7	0	
you likely have some versioning of requests installed that is at least 2.10.0 but you can check with the following if your installed versioning is less than 2.10.0 upgrade with proxy configuration according to the linked answer we set up a dict of we proxy using https in place of http because all of praw s requests happen over https we then have to pass this to the session that praw uses
