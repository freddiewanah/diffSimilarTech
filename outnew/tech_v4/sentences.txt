some of the totalfleetunit fields have chars in them so it should ignore these documents and only consider fields that can be converted into int
on the iphone 7 plus in portrait readable content guides are the same as the view s margin guides but in landscape there is more white space on either side of the text view
so only the joomla root homepage will be replaced by wordpress homepage also all other joomla and wordpress urls will work as it is
this is happening due to integer overflow in computer programming an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value
while direct equivalent is not available with swift this can be achieved relatively elegantly with objective-c and categories
so if your new type is unsigned following rule #2 if we subtract one more than the max value of the new type 256 from 800 we eventually end up in the range of the new type with 32
i ve created a website that has a contact form that send an email to me the action that i want to achieve is that when any user it doesn t have to be logged in submit that contact form prevent the submission of that form again for a period of time this is to prevent spam. i ve been going through jwt tokens and thought about using a token to validate after the user submitted that form but i don t know if that s a possible solution and i wanted to know if there is another way of doing it. i m using c# web api for my backend and angular 5 in my clientside app
the vtune sampling profiler is certainly more powerful than the vs sampling profiler
there are many possibilities on how it could be implemented directx opengl gdi are all possibilities
the following snippet works in google-chrome but the button and div with button cannot be dragged mozilla firefox unless the alt key is pressed down no idea about mobile i used and datatransfer.setdata is there something i missed
the first column determines grouping membership the second column should be used for filtering and the two last columns should just follow along
so in swift the replacement function must be marked objective-c in swift 4 it is optional and apparently harmless in swift 3
using openssl rand filbytes out file output description a directory in dev shm since ram is significantly faster than disk storage
it might have been stardog or blazegraph
when you enter your while loop for the first time the program will take whatever value in number which has not been initialized thus can be anything to compare with max and min
chicken scheme and guile scheme are both scheme implementations and they differ from each other enough to be scheme dialects but then i don t think racket #lang racket should be called a scheme dialect or even a scheme implementation
when performing addition the usual arithmetic conversions are performed on the operands which state expr 11.5.3 otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
implicit arrays for script or functions in addition to anubhava s correct answer if basic syntax for-loop is there is a special case in bash when running a script or a function arguments passed at command lines will be assigned to arrays variable you can access by and so on
see the definition of compareto t o returns a negative integer zero or a positive integer as this object is less than equals to or greater than the specified object
looking closer the web method appears to be restricted to get requests however you re making a post request type post you ll need to change one or the other
i think there are more than two directory in your train and test folder
i am so far aware of these rendering errors filtering html objects seems not to be supported in safari edge and ie colormatrix seems to be buggy in google-chrome when applied to svg objects colormatrix and component linear have been reported to be buggy in firefox 57 windows i have not seen all of these errors so feel free to add to this list or correct it
my problem is figuring out how large the image is width height don t help since compressed are smaller than width height
increment -3 to -2. 2 5 0 1 -2 - jump 4 steps forward escaping the maze. the code edit i compiled and ran the code with cpython that dropped runtime to 2.53s but that s still almost an order of magnitude slower than pypy
cpus without flags typically have some simple compare-and-branch instructions often against zero like mips bltz and others that compare two inputs and write a 0 1 result to another integer register mips sltiu -- set on less than immediate unsigned
we all tend to forget the 2nd time around when the app runs ie when it is brought back into the foreground onpause does get called after onresume and hence it kills the thread.
sorting once before filtering is cheaper than searching for a duplicate in the entire array for every array element o n²
i found that i could get some arframe from sceneview.session.currentframe but i did not find how to make a function that would be called for each frame or each time my function has ended and is ready to receive the next frame
for example if your functions operate on double s you can still say add 1 2 and the int arguments will be converted to double s
while aaronfay s answer is good and works i think that given that there are only 3 http methods other than get and you are only worried about put it is clearer and simpler to just define the request sub-classes per method
the jdbc oci driver makes jni calls to the oci c client library and hence depends on the oracle full client to be installed oci is also what sqlplus uses
staged changes are a lot like unstaged changes except that they ve been marked to be committed the next time you run git commit
i was currently solving the same problem for my new problem you can convert your web app to a mobile app with apache cordova specifically using the ionic you won t change much on server side node.js however few change as to be made on angular js and very little on view to adapt on ionic design view which very similar to bootstrap tags
i m surprised it s not more dramatic as x86 cpu div instructions can have latencies as high as 80-90 cycles for 64bit division on some cpus compared to mul at 3 cycles and bitwise ops at 1 cycle each
to quote the tip-of-the-master-branch pcap 3pcap man page packets buffer timeout if when capturing packets are delivered as soon as they arrive the application capturing the packets will be woken up for each packets as it arrives and might have to make one or more calls to the operating system to fetch each packet. if instead packets are not delivered as soon as they arrive but are delivered after a short delay called a packets buffer timeout more than one packets can be accumulated before the packets are delivered so that a single wakeup would be done for multiple packets and each set of calls made to the operating system would supply multiple packets rather than a single packets
and don t forget to include the interceptor in ngmodule a similar approach can be used to inject authorization token etc
my problem is that this fields are actually obtained after the evaluation of a condition and must return a tinyint 1 to be interpreted as boolean in my c# code since the bool type don t exist in my sql
you may avoid to use the while loops until you are obliged it may be better with a for-loop
mkdir c delete robocopy server test c delete e move minlad 30 log c temp deleteoldfiles.txt xd this folder will not be deleted fat rmdir c delete s q that is how i solved this problem
i m not sure what you mean by managed solution but automating an install of zeppelin and spark configuring to point at an external yarn master for job submission isn t too complicated and can be written in puppet chef or ansible fairly easily if you know those tools
you want something like you might also be able to do subsetting with something like this a reprex would have made this post more likely to get a good response but you should have been able to find something to help you with a little searching
however you can make it harder for reversers to obtain the credentials as explained in this article . to make it even harder you could force all your api calls to be done in https and enable ssl certificate pinning thus making proxy debugging man in the middle difficult to pull off
roughly speaking the default argument promotions are that int narrower than an int are converted to int and float values are converted to double
i have a hive table t1 that looks like this id score1 score2 1 4 11 1 5 12 1 5 13 2 3 14 2 3 15 2 2 12 2 2 11 3 6 10 3 6 11 3 6 12 i want for each id to select the max value of score1 and if the max value exists more than once then from the rows that contain max score1 i want to get min score2
i ve implemented a boolean array using bit compression and i want know if there s an interface that only have get int and set int boolean
unless you ve implemented your own compareto it s only ever going to return -1 0 or 1 based on whether the object is less than equals or greater than the other
you can ssh to the remote server and check yourself ssh deploy my-ip ruby -v # it s probably not 2.3.1 which bundle rvm use 2.3.1 # this is the actual version will be used by capistrano which bundle if you cannot see the bundle installed within ruby-2.3.1 you can manually install it by rvm use 2.3.1 gem install bundler after that the capistrano deployment should work as expected
with the existing markup two main things need to be done col has predefined paddings which needs to be reset use text-align right to align the svg to the right additionally svg elements w o a width set can cause trouble on some browsers so i gave it one here added to its markup with this you can now either add a margin or a padding of your choice to the col elements in the alternative below to the elements and in these samples i used margin
if any one might get into the similar problem then this is how i was able to fix this well some of my dependent library wanted the latest build versioning support might be updated or upgrade their code so gradle fetches the lates build if anyone have written versioning with 2+ or something like that avoid using that if not necessary and give fix library versioning
if you cannot upgrade visual studio to a newer versioning that includes newer versioning of nuget you can install nunit 3.5.0 which doesn t include .net standard
all the dependencies there should be added to the pom.xml file as dependencies and the lib folder will then be generated by maven in the webapp folder in the resulting war so think about reorganising your code to conform to the maven structure
programs that you use in commands must either be installed in tox virtualenv or whitelisted
inlineonly specifies that the method should never be called directly specifies that this function should not be called directly without inlining so i feel like this is a case where the call to set should have been inline but it was not
even tho it s longer this is more efficeint than min max solutions which still process the keys twice
it s just how the angular community works right now - anything that the angular team decides to endorse is becoming the safe standard whether it s good or not. that s why i think currently ionic is a less safe choice not because their ui or cli are not good but because the majority of the community will prefer to use angular material and angularcli no matter the actual differences. i believe that s why ionic is pushing to become relevant outside of the angular community it has become a hard environment to innovate outside of the core team but i believe the angular team is working to change that
quicksort is faster than mergesort because it has no loop in it s recursion where mergesort has to copy it s element in aux array and one more thing o nlogn is number of compares that mergesort does but it does also 6nlogn array acceses
edit as hans passant pointed out you can get an overflow error in case both int add up to more than a int can handle - so casting at least one of them to double is the smarter move return double a + b 2
ram being faster than disk usually vector is the better approach
it is common to write something like this which works fine. for those not familiar with knitr or sweave this echos the code and output in a latex verbatim environment and also adds the completed plot as a figure in the latex document. but now i would like to write more detailed line-by-line commentary like the problem is that there are now two knitr code chunks for the same plot
you can do the merge not with local master but with remote master or you can rebase your work which can be done with pull as well git fetch --all git rebase origin master if you have rule that you are merging every branch and you merged with remote branch but someone was still faster than you with the push you can reset the last merge and do it again git reset --hard head git merge.... git push origin master there are many ways how to do this
as the rule suggests wee should not use more than one break or goto statement in any iteration statement sample code i have tried with nested if statements but it is not a solution to terminate the loop
if you wanted to go the php route use something like cakephp everyone will say laravel but the learning curve for laravel is much steeper than it is for other less flexible but more compact frameworks
you can set fixed height and width for td and for the input you are appending to td

you do want a union all but i think this is the version of the query you want in other words sum distinct is no longer appropriate when you use union all
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byteexecution chars is implementation-defined
from the c standard 6.4.4.4 chars constants ...the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined

to ignore a failed step in declarative pipeline you basically have two options use script step and try-catch block similar to previous proposition by r_k but in declarative style use catcherror in both cases the build won t be aborted upon exception-handling in build job system-check-flow
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0
ionchange is an angular eventemitter that is used by ionic to handle input changes in most the custom components .it is defined in baseinput.ts which is extended by input.ts input is just the dom input that can be used with ionic elements as well as basic html input elements
like plus i see all the free calls there which should only be applied if malloc didn t return null
an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value
my first hope was that i could bind them and that would automatically do the conversion library dplyr bind_rows df_1 df_2 but no error in bind_rows_ x .id column a can t be converted from int to chars so my next attempt was to figure out which columns are in common now if i wanted to convert them all to numeric i might use but they are all different data types so i need to use the corresponding data type
in an angular project started with yeoman we have json files dev test dist... with the constants needed for each environment to work so that the gruntjs serve task is defined like and then in ngconstant we have so that it can be run with gruntjs serve dev gruntjs serve test .
to easily try things until success a while loops makes more sense than a for-loop
after installing ssl and making all pages https by using htaccess i realised that my website actually cannot run with https because it has a lot of embeded code with http protocol which cannot be changed to https or removed but simply removing the rewrite rule which forces https does not work because google has indexed all pages with https so now most part of the google search traffic goes to https version of website and they see mixed content error. i tried to implement examples that i found in forums but when i apply this code the browser always redirects from to here is the full code from .htaccess file
so the rgb range could be represented as min max tuple.
- housekeeper only needs the single prototypecontroller sweep at the end and has more mentioned above - housekeeper thread checks for testing of connections before seeing what connections may be expired some risk of testing expired connection that may be broken terminate through other timeout to db in firewall etc. - the project has unfinished code properties that are defined but not acted upon - the default max connection life if not defined is 4 hours excessive - housekeeper thread runs every five seconds per pool excessive you can modify the code and make these improvements
just a few simplified examples of data structures used by memory managers note that this is not the data structure in the program you created a linked list of allocated blocks would come with a linear o n for a single malloc -free pair making your code o n 2 a buddy scheme would come with a logarithmic o log n making your code o n log n implementations stressing the time complexity of malloc and free as an aspect of being fast would probable come close to o 1 i am imagining hash-tables this would probably come with a penalty in memory consumption and with a high 1 the constant time might be longer than for the other concepts with low n this would make your code o n or o 1 for low n note there is a scheme to make the memory manager data structures applying to all examples above within the administrated memory that would allow finding the block to free and relative to it the administration data in o 1 resulting in a free of o 1 . the mentioned data structures will however be searched by malloc taking the mentioned different time complexities for an unused block one which the size parameter to malloc does not helpfully point to directly . assuming that your code also has to malloc the blocks you are freeing you will probably actually end up with the mentioned complexities for the whole program

you can also get rid of the expensive operation if you check and subtract 1000000007 because re is smaller than 1000000007 before multiplying it by 2 it is smaller than so subtract 1000000007 is enough complete program
according to angular official tutorial pipe or filtering should not be used for sorting purpose
i have researched in all possible ways i could but it s hard for me to digest the fact that both malloc malloc sizeof 10 and calloc calloc 2 sizeof 5 allocates same contiguous memory ignoring the other facts that calloc initializes to zero and works relatively slower than malloc
modeling in pyomo is much faster than in scipy but pyomo documentation does not seem to say explicitly if this is feasible
this version does not deal with possible non-integer input and it makes some assumptions about what you would prefer to do if min is larger than max or if count is larger than the number of potential values
i need a formula to distribute values across a range while accounting for the max value possible conditions to check if the cell value is less than max then take cell value else subtract cell value from max and check conditions if there is a remainder in the subtraction and add to the next row
i m not familiar with safari or opera but users of those browsers are strongly advised to check whether or not similar support issues apply when using pointer events

the same error would be caused by double times int - the int gets implicitly cast as double since no type is specified for your variable the compiler chooses to interpret the result as double
moreover tree traversal is a natural approach to solving such problems and different traversal types can be used inorder preorder ...
let me answer this with an example suppose you input 1 3 4 29 12 -2 0 the input function reads this as a string the strip function eliminates whitespace from both ends of the string the split function splits the string into smaller strings with a delimiter that is a literal spaces in the list comprehension you can read it as for arr_temp in input .strip .split int arr_temp we get a list of integers stored in the variable arr
in that case int will be converted to double implicitly
following is the code can someone suggest how to optimize the code so that it takes less time in execution. i know bufferedreader and printwriter takes less time as compared to scanner and system.out.print
also post would be better than get and using a nonce would help prevent unwanted multiple submissions.
the numbers can t be equal to zero and the user must use numbers 1-4 to choose between addition subtraction multiplication and division

to preserve backwards compatibility rand allows max to be smaller than min as opposed to returning false as mt_rand
the activity already exists in android backstack and the extras are not caught in oncreate but they can be found in onnewintent if the extras are passed with an activity of a pendingintent then as per the official documentation
beyond that the best optimization is to give the machine enough ram to cache the whole database or at least the involved indexes so that no data have to be read from disk
gameviewcontroller gamescene as you can see with touchesbegan we can detect the touched world and select it with touchesmoved we are able to move the moveable node to the correct position and to detect the nearest visible world and with touchesended we can create the smooth scrolling to automatic move to the current nearest visible voice after a touch
i m trying to find overlapping intervals and decided to join the interval data on itself with dplyr left_join so that i could compare intervals with lubridate int_overlaps to every other interval by the same id
you can execute following alter database command which sets auto growth option to off for all databases using undocumented stored procedure sp_msforeachdb for single database parallel data warehouse instances only for all databases although this is not a server variable or instance settings it might help you ease your task for updating all databases on the sql server instance by excluding system databases and for all other databases following t-sql can be execute to get list of all database files and output commands prepare can be execute to prevent data files autogrow property to be changed i prepare below sql server ddl trigger once i used a ddl trigger for logging drop table statements. following trigger will also prevent you to change this property so if you need to update this property you have to drop this trigger first
this can be done using broom the proper tidyverse way of doing things would be using but base function split is delivering what you want
if i try to submit form of the second tab the stored earlier instance of simplebean solvo.ee.beans.simplebean 49a86248 won t be used instead the viewscopecontextmanager will create a new instance of simplebean class as we can see in log i have checked the code of the com.sun.faces.application.view.viewscopecontextmanager.copyviewscopecontextsfromsession method and as i understand this behavior is normal. however if i store request parameters or another important data in my bean i will loose it because the instance will be lost after submission the first form

it can be quite much faster than md5 sha functions and it produces good hash considering it output but it produces a smaller range of hash 64-bit output and as such is more likely to cause more conflicts
i guess the problem is that the destination width is bigger than the source width while the destination height is smaller
i would actually recommend using beautifulsoup for this kind of changes into the html structure and it should return and we are still using lxml but inside beautifulsoup
the ideal fix for this would have been openssl upgrade which was not available for the os that i am on- rhel7 or upgrade the ruby versioning not feasible or bring the two application on the same box again not feasible
straight forward i would implement this as or i could wrap the value in an optional note that parent is not a simple list it contains more than just children
note that long would be better than double since long can represent all int up to 2 63 - 1 precisely

fyi - ubuntu and i assume other systemd based distros does define the xdg_runtime_dir variable - which is a per-user temp space so little more secure than just tmp echo xdg_runtime_dir run user 1000 ls -ld xdg_runtime_dir drwx------ 2 ubuntu ubuntu 40 dec 22 15 18 run user 1000 i think xdg_runtime_dir is maintained by systemd pam so it won t be set in dockers or other non-systemd environments
in addition to the answer by don t panic dont forget to set the method attribute in your form tag to match your php code most likely it is pos or get or and you you can omit the method get since it is the default method. it worth mentioning that post is more secure and can carry more data since it uses the actual request body unlike get that appends the parameters to the url
safari is punishing you for incorrect syntax in your filter declaration according to spec this should be read as height 30000 and width 30000
inside the for-loop the number n is converted into a string to be split with loops index i and get each digit
it also makes it an int field rather than chars which is easier to read compare and should work faster
removing passwd control is even worse than using a standard passwd slightly more secure you can also make it so that only certain commands can use sudo
try using min so you would have more control over the minimum year range you wanted without worrying if the selectyear still reaches the current year
in some tests it even appears that prepare execute is slightly faster
you can also set figure size by passing dictionary to rc parameter with key figure.figsize in seaborn set method other alternative may be to use figure.figsize of rcparams to set figure size as below more details can be found in matplotlib documentation
you can see the discussion here py4j has bigger overhead than jython and jpype
the linear congruential generator explores every value less than the modulus when the multiplier and modulus are relatively primes
i would choose postgresql over mysql
from c11 6.4.4.4 p10-11 the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-deﬁned
another interesting object is the heap allocated object which can be created with malloc calloc in c and new or related mechanisms in c++
a nested class can be declared private public protected or package private
there is an ambiguity between the first and the third call because the implicit conversion sequence from unsigned chars to short is worse than the one from unsigned chars to int first one is a conversion while the second one is a promotion
first one is better because unsigned chars to int promotion is better than unsigned chars to short conversion
this is ambiguous unsigned chars to int is better than unsigned chars to short
unsigned chars to int is worse than unsigned chars to unsigned chars
second one is better because unsigned char to unsigned char exact match is better than unsigned char to short conversion
use calloc its much better than malloc and memset
the explanation why there would be type promotion here when comparing from standard 6.3.1.8 otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
getting the parameters of imageview is not possible at initialisation of activity to do so please refer to this solution or set the dimensions at onclick of a button like this and the code to be run when we want to rotate imageview this solution is sufficient for the problem above.although it will shrink the imageview even if it is not necessary when height is smaller than width .if it bothers you you can add another ternary operator inside scalex scaley
i have a solution to this. actually it is a solution to a problem that arises after rotation rectangular image doesn t fit imagview but it covers your problem too.. although this solution has animation for better or for worse getting the parameters of imageview is not possible at initialisation of activity to do so please refer to this solution or set the dimensions at onclick of a button like this and the code to be run when we want to rotate imageview this solution is sufficient for the problem above.although it will shrink the imageview even if it is not necessary when height is smaller than width .if it bothers you you can add another ternary operator inside scalex scaley
at the same time heapsort can actually be implemented in-place by building a max-heap from the input array in o n time and and then repeatedly swapping the maximum element to tbe back and shrinking the heap
so if you know what you re doing or are very willing to learn i would strongly suggest not having any fear of creating your own stuff like a custom tab bar which for your purposes is probably nothing more than a uiview with either uibutton subviews or other uiview subviews with tap gesture recognizers attached to them
for starters the function main without parameters shall be declared like int main void just change your program the following way and see what will happen if you try to enter the chars a instead of a number
join the table to itself on lesser ids because that s what you re ordering on summing all the rows from the join and keeping those rows whose sum is less than not less than or equal the threshold the coalesce call is added to cater for the lowest id which we want to keep always having no rows to join with
this code worked for me... the task is create a program inputs a phrase like a famous quotation and prints all of the words that start with h-z i was making the mistake of using words g before which needs to be replaced by words h . also you need to add the last print command in order to print the last words in case the phrase does not end with a punctuation as in the given example
the second issue that you should take into account is your ans array you try to initialize it with values that are much more bigger than int or double capable to hold values that are bigger than 2 64
here is what i ended up hacking together a spreadsheet document document with three sheets main the main data temp only used for the automatically added entries after submission links keeping the editing links and response ids corresponding to each line of the main sheet then a function that can be triggered from the menus creates a prefilled answer per line of main submit and puts the url and id in the links sheet

it comes in at 10x slower than a namedtuple fastest behind pure dictionary and 7x slower than standard intenum slowest behind numpy record
it uses recursive settimeout which performs better then setinterval
salt tend to be merged into hash values but they are not themselves secret so they can be trivially extracted
swift on linux is not interoperable with objective-c it is interoperable with c
with the given class-path entry in manifest.mf those jar files need to be placed to folder .. lib meaning lib folder in the parent folder of the directory where the executable jar is executed
i m facing the problem that my html5 sample video doesn t load in safari 11 on osx but works perfectly fine with google-chrome and firefox

since stringi runs slightly faster and has a larger set of functionalities i prefer to stick with stringi . see stringi vs stringr blog by hrbrmstr i tried to use base r data.frame syntax above where possible to avoid any confusion but if i were doing this for my self i d stick to the full data.table syntax as follows
there are many discussions about compiled-language such as golang vs interpreted-language such as ruby but generally a compiled-language is faster because the compilation phase optimizes the code and because the target machine can natively run the program without the need to use an interpreter extra layer
ifttt is simpler to setup zapier has more options like sending to more than one emails

i am using php 7.0.2 at one place in the manual on integers i saw the below statement integers can be specified in decimal base 10 hexadecimal base 16 octal base 8 or binary base 2 notation optionally preceded by a sign - or +
so far i have the query to aws working and ajax request returning the audiostream resource to the browser but firefox is complaining about the format media resource could not be decoded error error code ns_error_dom_media_metadata_err 0x806e0006 i m not very familiar with google-chrome debugging but it does not work there either
if the page requires to be scrolled to get to the save button and 692 23 would put the button behind a fixed header you should be able to verify that by taking a screenshot before the button click attempt then it may not be possible for whatever driver you re using to click the button
as for creating a sequence of attributes you can t do that in xpath which can t create new nodes you can however do that in xslt then you can use it elsewhere as in and will get xquery has a more compact syntax and in contrast to xpath allows expressions to create new nodes
site www.b.com has a ssl certificate so it needs to be served using https
the problem is that during the update your service will be briefly put in an inconsistent state and as a result clients will get random errors
i m using a audio source here but you can plug in a video source instead as long as it contains an audio track format that can be decoded aac mp3 ogg etc.

we re planning to use elk stack elasticsearch logstash kibana as a visualization tool but the question for us is how metrics should be delivered to kibana
i have a rather simple listview with gridview style
you could use the key bindings api to add support but it s not intuitive and now you implementing functionality you d get for free using a jtable based solution anyway generally speaking it s not intuitive as jlist is not meant to be editable so most users won t have that expectation mindset and it could cause frustration for the user as their expected results don t meet what your program is now doing
this is a performance killer for any server because disk even ssd is orders of magnitude slower than ram
debian 9.3 is current but that probably matters much less than debian being tested less than ubuntu
some deductions on the matter i understand that ubuntu is based on unstable debian so stable debian is better for production
in cases where the cell contents are larger than the width of the cell i would like to set the fittext property so that the row height is unchanged
i m confused because many people says that swift is faster than objective-c in general
i know i probably won t use more than 2 10 9 ids and if i did i could always use bigserial and it s not all that important but it seems a bit unclean to me to have signed integer reference an unsigned one
if you want to control your image without adding style to the header you can simply add fixed width to a and make it display block since you know the width of your image then simply use margin auto or use display table and you don t need to specify a width
for example i was expecting that zeromq would be faster than zeroc ice
ice is faster even if zeromq is sending empty messages
nevertheless zeromq is always slower than ice
one thing that is understood is the bottom spacing margin and padding will be equal to or slightly greater than ideally height + 8dp you bottom navigation
instead you should declare them in the tightest scope where they are needed i should be declared in loops header while count should be declared and initialized inside the for-loop
as i wrote the question i ended up finding out how to do it it should also be noted that extends basic prototypes is usually not a good idea - in the event the base standard is changed to implements new functionality there might be a conflict in your own code base
if this interpretation is correct the your statement since the defers will be called when the for-loop ends is wrong printf will be called after loops but defer is called inside and everything is consistent with the behaviour explained in the other answers
what we ended up doing for single instance is to use qlocalsocket which is named pipe on windows and local domain socket on unix instead of qsharedmemory which requires more tweaking to get it right
i would even say that intuitively files can usually be much larger than ram but smaller than a single disk however even this is not always true
grouping is essentially mapping and should run faster than sorting
but my confusion is since i don t care about the order of name i should be able to do some kind of grouping which should be cheaper than sorting first and do sorting only on the numeric field
it will recurse down and check if the next value in the array is greater than or less than the min and max and set accordingly
that expression does have type std ostream
it s incredibly frustrating to have to always be suggested a directory first instead of a file since in my opinion jumping to a directory is totally useless - all it does is scroll you in the folder projects view to that directory
i made some changes to swift class so that it would be used in objective-c by using objective-c syntax
for a number the default value is 0 if a function return number instead of sting the port will be 0 port 0 is a reserved port in tcp ip networking meaning that it should not be used in tcp or udp messages
possible solutions create a separate listinguser that s than inherited by a detailuser that s declaring advantage allows clean typing backdrop adding more representations would be pain or not possible if not fitting in the inherited chain create a single user class that contains optional properties advantage single class to maintain backdrop you can never be sure which representation you currently have needs potentially a lot of checks
here i used vs code as an ide issue was will result in solution i should include the following tsconfig.json file in the project then i used tsc without file name so the transpiler would use the tsconfig.json to transcompile all type script files hosted in the directories to js files
e.g. for readline that link is in the libreadline-dev package which can be installed on mint ubuntu debian type systems like this sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev perl 6 nativecall docs discuss this too if you write native foo nativecall will search libfoo.so under unix like system libfoo.dynlib on os x foo.dll on win32
here libc++ is not fully binary compatible with libstdc++
a lot of people have answered that you can use generics but you can also simply remove the readinteger method and only use the readdouble as int can be converted to double without data loss
outputs i believe this would work as long as your slice_x and slice_y are smaller than the width and the height respectively
if it was rounded down it is slightly less than min and hence it is also in the subnormal range
here is my code the block of my code can read a singe chars int only which is not exactly what i intend to do i intends to reads more than one chars int it doesn t work
look into the max of the column to point out the outlier if its greater than 75 percentile of values
we can do this with mutate_all as grepl works on vector matrix and not on data.frame or using str_replace with base r we can use lapply it is better to create character columns instead of factors
even with a tighter bound you still need to handle more than int and double
you can do it by adding one more div with 980px width to wrap inner container so applied margin will work
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior
that s all clear however i am not sure what with salt in hashing. i read os.urandom python is good to create good salt what i am not sure is how to work with this added salt if i hash user password with salt and its one way
i read in thread rich text to image in qt by dmitry sazonov it can maybe be done using qtextedit document qtextdocument drawcontents however i do not find any examples out there
i ve got somewhat of a solution where you just check if the elements position is less than 0 and if it is set it back to 0 or if it s greater than the width height set it to the width height
if you use a chars type in an arithmetic expression even unsigned chars it will be promoted to int 1 and arithmetic with int values is not fully specified in c notably the behavior upon overflow is undefined
i am suspecting that the current nic s mtu speed has to do with something since when i type like this below i get this ifconfig| grep mtu up broadcast running multicast mtu 1500 metric 1 up broadcast multicast mtu 1500 metric 1 up broadcast multicast mtu 1500 metric 1 up loopback running mtu 65536 metric 1 here is the result graph of latency as you can see the f-stack performance decreases when the packets size is more than 1500
i would go for these two changes to optimize this query first i would split the query to two parts combined with a union preferably a union all if you don t care about removing duplicates but also possible with union distinct
sliderinput is not the option unless it could be shown as chars values not int
this uploaded files could also be seen through hdfs namenode web ui
how can multiplication function takes longer than division
the amount of memory reserved depends on the data type a chars will take up more memory than an int
when opening said window the viewmodel of the datagrid would be loaded immediately - but since no row has been selected the viewmodel that belongs to the detailed view would not be intialized which means that the visibility binding of the detail view would fail and the binding s fallbackvalue would be used to hide the detail view. the issue with this approach is that the visual studio wpf xaml designer will not show the content of the affected containers since they are hidden due to their fallbackvalue
i made the mistake at first to go with uitableview only to realize halfway that uicollectionview is way more powerful
i currently want to build a simple application using java or python. i started coding not long ago i do not know where to start from. these are things i would like to know basically i want to build a background application or program that detects current keyboard layout as in which language and just displays the next language on the screens everytime i push shift + alt so that i can know to which language i am switching in windows 10. because task bar is now set to automatically be hidden when mouse cursor is not around it
my code applying documentlistener to txt_ip4class classw.main contains two conditions if zero it will set other fields based on jcombobox txt_ip4class will be replaced if one it should be set jcombobox choosing an option
to use it in layout file however you have to take care of cases such as the device is in landscape this way you ll have the width much greater than the height so the view won t fit
public class fragment1 extends fragment implements loadermanager.loadercallbacks choreographer skipped 31 frames
this tells us that dask is about 50 slower than pandas for this task this is to be expected because the chunking and recombining of data partitions leads to some extra overhead
i d like to add operator overloads to allow vector s to be added and subtract from each other
this is possible if you make the switch to git which can be hosted inside tfs and vsts
also if super is used then how should it be used like super btcwallet self .__init__ coin_name tx_fee or super wallet self .__init__ coin_name tx_fee problem 2 since coin_name and tx_fees isn t saved in the database so when could it fail
also note that this should be run server-side only as doing so client-side exposes information about your password requirements in plain-sight to any hackers yes it s still possible for them to figure it out by creating an account and trying to use easy passwords but it still means they have to put a little bit of effort into figuring out what is and is not allowed explanation assert position at the start of the line positive lookahead ensuring at least one lowercase letter in any language script exists positive lookahead ensuring at least one uppercase letter in any language script exists positive lookahead ensuring at least one number any any language script exists positive lookahead ensuring at least one character that isn t a letter number or control character in any language script exists match any character 8 or more times assert position at the end of the line
i m trying to make a what should be a simple responsive page that consists of several divs as depicted below the overall max-width and max-height are 1200 and 1000 respectively vertically-static divs must only resize horizontally if the browser window is resized but vertically they need to always be fixed in height vertically-resizeable div needs to adjust both its width and height based on the window dimensions
sadly so far i have been unable to come up with a solution that fulfills all our requirements only administrators and automated process accounts like maven release on jenkins can push directly to master everybody else must open a pull request which requires an approval everybody can merge approved pull requests we are a small organization on a github team plan and we re happy to switch plans if necessary
result for sequence abb edit to filter out tuples with duplicates i like the idea of a callable dictionary that can be used with map
some stylistic points you don t need to use sizeof chars - it s defined to be 1 dsize should be unsigned and should really be a size_t which is bigger than an int as soronellhaetir points out you don t need to use another struct - you can modify the passed-in one
this has many consequences namely that addition and multiplication is no longer associative
in swift each generic class represents its own type and even if you have a generic class where the generic type parameter is a subclassing of your other generic class having the superclass as its generic parameter the two generic classes won t be related through inherited
the framework is written in swift and can be used in objective-c as well so it combines rlmobject and object types
difference between tcp and socks5 proxy socks5 is a general proxy protocol that can do more than a tcp proxy including one-to-many connections listening ports and udp
the only routes that is available if one is not logged in is get post login and get post register after their declaration goes middleware that checks if user have special cookie if not a user will be redirected to get login and it works just fine. you can view the whole code if needed on github mnevo there is three main middlewares cookieparse parse cookie from request session encode cookie and write it to req.cookie.user validate if cipher was mine then you ll get json out of cookie if not it will be undefined i inserted console.log in each except cookie parser and in login route
please see the image below i have detected that the issue happens when the image width is more than 2x 2 times the height of the image
i want to add the tomcat plugin to my gradlew build but the plugin cannot be found gradlew shows the error plugin with id com.bmuschko.tomcat not found. i followed the steps on the github page of this plugin but it does not work. in my project i have general build.gradle in this i am loading my project.gradle in this i defined the tomcat-plugin configuration
you can use elemmatch as a projection operator but this will only bring you first matching subdocument second way is by using aggregation framework here the point is that you need to grouping back your unwinded subscriptions to get back original shape after filtering
its height should be no more than the height of other cells and its width should be that of empty unoccupied area
you should upgrade your system first because the 4.9.0 kernel versioning is no longer on kali linux repository then install the appropriate kernel headers package
based on these objects the compareto object must return a value either less than zero equals zero or greater than zero
so if your rss feed is at the atom link element should be this including an atom link element in your rss feed makes it more portable and easier to cache
this is simplest to solve in postgresql in either database you can do this using not exists as well i used mysql syntax for the date arithmetic in this version
i checked and it looks fine unless width or height is greater than max texture size which i doubt or internal format rgba is not supported which also not likely here is the full code gl_call checks for glgeterror and it is set to gl_invalid_value 0x0501 after glteximage2d
my input and input1 should be set in int instead of chars
this definitions acts on the lifetime of variables automatic objects have their life bound by their containing block static objects come to life at the beginning of the program and their life extends to the end of the program dynamic variables are created by malloc and associated function s from the standard library and shall be destroyed by free
since the data frame in the list are in the same format just coerce them into a single data frame with dplyr bind_rows saving the element name by passing an .id parameter which can be used for grouping after filtering by joining with wanted

the upgrade-insecure-requests directive will not ensure that users visiting your site via links on third-party sites will be upgraded to https for the top-level navigation and thus does not replace the strict-transport-security hsts header which should still be set with an appropriate max-age to ensure that users are not subject to ssl stripping attacks

something like this this worked fine in older versions of apt-key but recent versions have two issues a different output format i can hack around that a warning warning apt-key output should not be parsed stdout is not a terminal clearly i can hack around this as well just redirect stderr to dev null
since according to the comment all the price records have the same amount you could use the aggregate max or min to just get one of them and a case expression to choose between max and sum depending on the price_volume_cost_indicator select price_volume_cost_indicator case price_volume_cost_indicator when price then max amount else sum amount end from my_table group by price_volume_cost_indicator
this question differs from others because the boxplot chart needs to be reduced in height and aligned to the left outer margin of the histogram

you can use template engines for these kind of requirements there are multiple template engines are available like apache velocity apache freemarker thymeleaf pebble but i feel apache freemarker is better
the documentation for glibc stays they are integer types no narrower than unsigned int but i m not finding a standards reference that says they have to be an integer type see also time_t
... ino_t shall be defined as unsigned integer types
fsblkcnt_t fsfilcnt_t and ino_t shall be defined as unsigned integer types
otherwise if you want a very high level api built on top of bokeh that supports more advanced interactive statistical and gis chart types have a look at holoviews
examples include tp lex yacc ag tply delphi compiler generator so in short if what you are wanting to do can be expressed in lazarus fpc code there is a very good chance it can be executed in pascal script code
however if the compiler decides that it would rather not inline your static inline-functions either because it think s that inlining is worse or because inlining is impossible then it will have to make a separate copy of that function in each file it s used in
this would then cause the oncreate method to be invoked and recreate the table
incidentally that value can be stored in 48 bits but most systems don t have a 48-bit integer type so it will probably be stored in 64bit of which the high-order 16-bit will be zero. when you use an expression of one numeric type to initialize an object of a different numeric type the value is converted
to show and hide buttons i would use display like described here javascript style.display none or jquery hide is more efficient
btw keydown event is usually more reliable if for some reason keyup is one off on results keydown is probably better
one way would be to remove the margin attribute or change the width to something lower than 100vw. what you are doing is saying the element should be as wide as the browser window 100 of the window width and then also saying that outside that width it should have more margin in your case 15px on the right and 260px on the left and that is streching the page causing the total widht to be larger than window width
let s say we want to find the median of the range starting at the second 2 inclusive and ending at the 1 exclusive . these are 7 elements thus the median has rank 4 fourth-smallest element in that range. now using a rank0 1 call in the root bitvector at the beginning and end of this range we find the corresponding range in the children of the root as you can see the left range which contains only smaller elements has only 3 elements thus the element with rank 4 must be contained in the right child of the root
i m new in ubuntu previously i tried to set this up on centos because i m more familiar with centos but it was worse than using ubuntu because many dependencies are missing out of date
initially i thought there is a chance that this might have something to do with the type and maybe using xor swap in int arrays would give a better results than on chars arrays so i ve built upon your benchmark one for int arrays just to text - turns out the same results more or less for int xor swap is just slower than using a temporary variable
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

as suggested in the comments you can increase the figure size manually making sure the width is three time bigger than the height
it was my understanding that throwing an exception-handling in my method in a controller should be caught in try-catch of the custom middleware
i think i would have used addition rather than division
note that as per the change list here support for remote debugging of v2 functions was only enabled in 15.0.31201.0 and was granted a bug fix in 15.0.40108.0. so go into tools and extensions see what versioning of the azure functions and web jobs tools you have and if it s older than 15.0.40108.0 upgrade it
here is the code which i was trying it is complicated condition like greater than range max on the basis of condition number this function decides condition meet or not and return true or false
with the assumption of digit height is always greater than digit width and the minimum fitting rectangle is always along the axis of the digits i have obtained a rotation value
multiplication is way faster than division

please note the shipping estimator and shipping charge options in checkout will not be affected by the above changes and will still be displayed without tax as usual - only once you have selected a shipping method and you are looking at the total in the totals section of your cart summary will it be affected
when window is scroll down we will detect that if scroll space from top is bigger than 100px the image will be faded out hide and as opposite scroll the image will be faded in show
for deserialization this annotation must be defined. the type annotation can have parameters and parameters can be used by serializable deserialization handlers to enhance the serializable or deserialization result

configuring maven now we need to configure maven to use our file structure view toolchain_view vobs playvob toolchain 3p maven-repo as only central repository store the local repository below tmp and have the target directories also below tmp the first two can be configured in maven settings file but apparently the last one unfortunately seems to require specific changes in the pom.xml file
conversely if you actually want to use datetime fields you can use this if there s no intersection you ll get a negative number because the max start value is greater than the min end value
the width is smaller than the height
the width is usually at least two times larger than the height
another way i came up with this to try to work is to create a uiview that spans larger than the scrollview to allow the child view to be a subviews of this larger view that has the scroll view as its parent
so if the mouseenter occurs in less time that the delay setted the things to do on mouseleave won t be done
if the photo width is larger than the container the height sticks to the original height
if i had a simple imageview i would have used picasso or glide etc for this easily
it means that there might be two potential source of the performance difference you rounding up to more than 9 significant digits so the loop will be run more times if you multiplying first div96by32 might work slower if after multiplication the mantissa has more non-zero 32-bit words
the situation with private static bigdecimal computes int a the problem is that while i compile the program it make a incompatible types error telling me that bigdecimal cannot be converted to double wich seem to be a nonsence when you know that bigdecimal.divide bigdecimal int roundingmode dont need any double and his polymorphic methods neither.
edit it seems to be caused by zsh not reproducible in bash
some conversions however are not obvious or not portable cannot be converted to no matter what the respective values of x and y are isize and usize have a platform specific size anywhere as small as 16-bit but as large as 64bit
then i can create a pop-up dialog that has newsletter form using any jquery pop-up dialog plugins
int storage may require less memory than double on some systems here only half the memory is required
the theory is that by using autotools you could create a software package that can be compiled on linux freebsd netbsd openbsd dragonflybsd and other operating systems
what s weird however is that when i run these functions and receive the message from the pubsub the following is logged putting round end before take i never get to the after take which suggests to me that the channel doesn t have anything in it but i m pretty sure that isn t the case as it should have been put to in the event handler of the pubsub immediately prior
my solution is to create a myevent inside class a and myevent in class b i know probably is not so good as parent classes shouldn t know about children
take the smallest value nb the argument of the function must be a span element or an element which is smaller than its parent otherwise if children and parent have both the same width height function will fail
a while loops usually works better for what you re trying to accomplish than a for-loop
for example you can use this workflow browser javascript code - make a ajax fetch api request to you service end point this service endpoint can be created using express - then when you hit this end point you can use node.js libraries to call the executable you wish in the express callback function and return a response like executable was executed
we have an application doing udp broadcast. the packet size is mostly higher than the mtu so they will be fragmented
the children could be be moved between parent and i need to be able to reflect that in the database
3 perform the iteration of loops before the _strlength .you place the wrong condition in for-loop which is less than equal to .because we start the character arrays to zero 0 till less than the size of string
on windows you also need to have sdl_image.dll libpng and zlib dlls in your running directory
cut off the first 4 chars to get rid of var find the index of to cut out the substring representing the variable s name again cut off the leading chars to get rid of remove the trailing the remaining string now only contains values int or strings and commas so now is the time to use split separator to get the single values numeric values of course have to be parsed into int using int stringnum string values on the other hand have to be stripped of the leading and trailing quotes if the format is not 100 consistent or is more complicated than you showed in your example you should have a look at the scanner class
since i don t feel super comfortable with protected private inheritance in c++ i googled it up and came up with this stackoverflow answer difference between private public and protected inheritance
i tried to change some of my scripts from sweave to knitr and have found that subfigure failed to render properly when using knitr while they were correct with sweave
argv is so is just chars type which can be converted to int implicitly
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
or you can define a grandparent and then inherit it and make more than one parent and then again inherit it for children accordingly
as an example to obtain the second entry in that imaginary log file i would have done git pull # make changes to these files git add file3 file4 # verify changes run tests etc.. git commit -m correct typos git push in a nutshell git add and git commit lets you break down a change to the main repository into systematic logical sub-changes

i want to scale image to fit screen width and keep aspect ratio if image height is smaller than screen height
use transform with boolean indexing detail another slowier solution with filtering timings setup caveat the results do not address performance given the number of grouping which will affect timings a lot for some of these solutions
the effect was that it makes the font size to fill width and if the text doesn t fit any more as it is the case in portrait mode on my tablet it replaces part of the text with ... also in landscape mode while most of the text fits perfectly in height the slash is bigger than the height and is partly outside the button at the bottom
if your coordinates are each n-bit int this should be more space-efficient than boolean format as long as your sparsity is less than 1 n - 3 or so for 32-bit
you could try a sort order like order by case when parent_id is null then id else parent_id end asc id asc if indeed the id of the parent is lower then it s children then the parent will show first
the edges could be handled differently for example by testing if the 1st chord begins at 0 or not before loops but i feel that the single for-loop makes for cleaner code
new java 8 encoder decoder is running faster than any other implementation but you need java 8...
note this is objective-c can be converted to swift over the years these emoji-detecting solutions keep breaking as apple adds new emojis w new methods like skin-toned emojis built by pre-cursing a character with an additional character etc
a crossover keeps the genetic information from both parent children are mirror images so one child will be worse than the parent and the other better or both the same
this means that the number of bytes is not a bit more than width x height x 3 but much less
this makes the landscape photos look much smaller than the portrait ones
however a large part of the range 57 1024 has fewer than 100 fractions per integer and in the interval 171 1024 there are only 10 fractions or fewer per integer
if you use the first 17 values as listed above this covers the part of the range with fewer than 100 fractions per integer so that would reduce the impact of rounding errors below 1
the generic sql solution uses coalesce in sql server isnull is a better choice for performance reasons
advantages are less spatial coupling - you send messages to the message broker without knowing where the receiver is located easier load balancing - you don t need any additional infrastructure except the message broker to run competing consumers pull model is more honest than the push model built-in retries for transient failures like database locks things like polly can help here too with http of course keep failures in the poison message queue for further analysis this is something that comes to my mind immediately
the general idea of abstract classes and interfaces is to be extended implements by other classes cannot be constructed alone that use these general settings some kind of a template making it simple to set a specific-general behaviour for all the objects that later extends it
i am new to java and specially web service and just started working for a company which uses jboss eap server which is quite same as wildfly and unfortunately i am receiving same error there as well while working on a web service assignment
since the introduction of bool it has been a subclass of int and boolean can be cast into int implicitly this was for historical reasons compatibility with pre-2.3 apis
i am using phpmyadmin version information 3.2.4 when i need to relation view it is not available that option then i search problem-solving this rule must be changed from myisam type to innodb
similar to sam westrick s definition number of times you can subtract n2 from n1 without going negative you could also do integer division with addition and greater-than using the definition number of times you can add n2 to itself before it is greater than n1 . addition might seem like a conceptually simpler thing than subtraction
i got one solution but there are some limitations like the width of th and td will be fixed the height of the table will be fixed that solution is here jsfiddle i m trying to make the table with these properties responsiveness height and width dynamic width of td and th vertical and horizontal scroll-able with fixed thead with bootstrap table i have done this.
can it be done using gson or am i supposed to use something like jackson
the problem is that once i have set a metrics value for a particular set of labels even if that metrics is not collected again it will be scraped by prometheus until the application restarts and the metrics is removed from memory
this means that even if that metrics is no longer valid anymore hasn t been set again for a day say prometheus will still be scraping it as if it s a fresh metrics
it is usually better than octal base 8 because each hex digit is 4 bits and binary data is usually arranged in clumps of powers of 2 due to how our computer bit-addressing works
in theory it might be fixed on comtypes side or by re-installing python to another folder like c python3x but you will have to run the script as administrator anyway because of other os restrictions pywinauto will warn about insufficient rights in nearest future now it s silent
to give an analogy this is like expecting a parser that reads character by character to realize that 1+2 3 is not 1+2 3 but 1+ 2 3 unless you specify somehow that multiplication has higher precedence over addition
as far as i am aware currently only swift classes that inherit from nsobject can be declared objective-c and bridged into an objective-c project
the value is no lower than min or the next integer greater than min if min isn t an integer and is less than but not equal to max
your query will need to process quite a lot of rows and will likely never be subsecond however you re using the output of an analytic function as a filtering where grouping aggregation is more efficient so by rewriting your query as below you ll see a slight improvement
the factors seem to be converted to int when an argument is converted to vector as you know data frames are lists of vectors of equal length so the first row of a data frame is also a list and when it is forced to be a vector something like this happens i don t know how apply achieves what it does factors are represented by chars values -- if you re interested look at its source code
changing carousel height according to image height is a more common scenario whereas changing carousel width is more specific scenario
compared with udp tcp generates more network traffic when the cluster size increases
the answer would be the first option but for this type of tasks i do not recommend using qtreewidget since it has unnecessary elements causing the memory consumption to increase and the speed to decrease it would be appropriate to use qtreeview and create a custom model but if you want to show the information of the local files there is already a model that implements it qfilesystemmodel
after all that all it needed was the url to be https not http just in case it helps anyone else in the future in postman the url was just set as domain.co.uk but in my code i had put for the base url of the api so the api required all calls to be made using ssl

screenshots of some steps 3. 4.1 4.2 the same could be done using qwidget as a base instead of qgraphicsview
your forms should be rendered as get methods and the data submitted as a post request
obviously for-loop are very much r-like as loops are not very efficient in many cases
also i do not know which serializable deserialization method is more suitable for such a use case
they are safer than strcpy by providing the buffer size of the destination similar to strncpy
just to add to the answers above if you register a receiver in on oncreate it should be unregistered in ondestroy
for this scenario i prefer using post get directly instead of using resources because i am not forced to use a specific function name such as create especially if the controller of your nested resource has only one endpoint function users admin with post
alternatives would have been strcpy or strncpy but as length including the trailing null character

when you creates a table in hive then what happens behind the scene is it stores the metadata in some relational database depending on which is configured for your environment and actual data will be stored on hdfs warehouse directory if that is managed table
when you use cursor.commit after the numerous insert s you are effectively executing one database transaction and the data is stored in ram in the interim it may be written to disk but not all at the time when you instruct the database to finalize the transaction
unless there s a feature of myisam that you can t get with innodb i would highly recommend using innodb and optimizing where necessary
note the draggable are larger than the droppable
release notifications are only available with tfs 2018 later and vsts
i need help with the following case statement the problem is the 4 values h u8 a oh are datatype varchar 10 and obviously contain a non-numeric chars therefore they cannot be converted to int i think
note it s not a good idea to cast it into int value because max double value is greater than max int value
after banging my head against the screen for an hour i figured it was all my mistake actually map json is another extension that needs to be imported into maven pom.xml
means i want you to think as parent-children relationship where provider would be in parent and all the store actions and subscriptions should be done in children

the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself if you want to sort your items by let s say name here it goes in your html
scipy supports some scikit-learn is even more complete and imho better and more actively developed for these tasks
to send emails using mailgun and mailchimp so that it comes from your domain an dns txt record needs to be added mailgun advises using a subdomain i do not know why and the record looks like this thus i understand it sends email from the mg.expertbox.com domain mailchip assumes the root domain is used to send and requires the following no option to specify subdomain so this assumes sending from the root domain
although many short articles on the web comparing mysql and postgresql generally tend to claim that postgresql is technically more advanced acid json support etc.. these two problems seem to be serious drawback to me
there are a few problems onclick should be lowercase as onclick onmouseover should be lowercase as onmoueover onmouseout should be lowercase as onmouseout some browsers tolerate the incorrect capitalisation and some do not which would explain the inconsistencies between them
external table can only be read by hive but not managed by hdfs
about replication mysql has had a replication solution much earlier than postgresql
when use_natural_primary_keys true is specified django will not provide the primary key in the serializable data of this object since it can be calculated during deserialization
your code is redundant with background transparency and with background-color transparency it s better to use however you can act directly to your in your css adding
i have a simple class and a mvc controller method i am calling the controller method via jquery-ajax this works perfectly fine with google-chrome and firefox
for example take image_arrow_up.jpg you can set it s size with another way would be to use percentages although this is not as concrete as min and max another option is to use css with the image-set function or with scrset + sizes it also helps to make sure the original image is sized appropriately
add access modifiers to function class properties must be defined as public private or protected
i try below code here calculate min and max time is but slider hours is started from min - 04 18 and max - 45 18 i need min - 04 30 and max - 45 38
as a counter it is used in the while-loop or the do-while-loop the variable will be incremented value will be increased inside loops and loops will continue as long as the condition remains true what role does it have here a i
i want to make the img fit the div height if it is smaller than the width or fit the div width if it is smaller than the height i want this to work well even when the img is small i want it to stretch to fit the max-height of the div or stretch to fit the 100 width of the div without losing the aspect ratio this is where i am so far
then method 2 significant performance improvement this uses the same idea expressed in the last section of my answer comparison to tai s method that int indexing is faster than boolean indexing for small number of expected elements to be selected and avoids creating an initial index at all
for a small number of selected elements int indexing is faster than boolean indexing making this method more efficient than tai s method even after tai optimized his code
since the screen size for portrait is less than 480px but if i rotate its more than 480px in landscape mode which makes it medium size as per tachyons
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0
the returned value is of type int which is wider than chars since it can also return eof for when input reading failed generally because the stream was closed
so i plotted the first scanline of the image as calculated by libtiff green and as shown by imagemagick purple here i zoom in on the left side - you can see they both start at column 165 and here i zoom in on the right side it looks like one imagemagick has a lower radiometric resolution fewer bits for the pixel brightness than the other because it is more stepped but sometimes it seems downright lazy and is totally static when it clearly could represent more accurate values
anyway using ipython s timeit we see that the manual approach with checks on the fly is still about three times slower than using itertools so even improving the checks will probably not make it faster than that
so i was trying to make my modal only work on screens smaller than tablet
in a spring boot application in the build.gradle when i run application with gradlew 4.4 i get the taskinternal.execute method has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in gradlew 5.0
i will recommend using settimeout instead setinterval try this
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior
2 errors when i do either this is what happens in my computer 1 cmd processors consumes more than 60 of cpu and memory and runs for a while. 2 it then gives out error messages
probably onpause should be replaced with onresume and vice versa
so there are some parent name s that have more than one children of course
the functions setg setp gbump and pbump are protected members and would not be called by public member functions by default so you needn t worry about them
if you determine the parent s split axis to be z to children share a boundary on the xy plane then your ray s direction in z is negative -.707 and you should traverse the child whose centroid has the lower z coordinate first
in some cases calloc is also much faster than malloc memset .
when the system is running low on real memory ram things in memory that are not actively being used can be written to disk and loaded back into ram later
by enabling the configuration setting multidexenabled you are telling android it is ok to generate more than 1 dex file for the apk
by default xamarin.android uses the older mono managed httpclient handler that does not support tls 1.2
or even better alk suggested about the input part you can do this though instead of using atof it is much better to use strtof or strtod functions
that is because a you don t know if the file is a complete number of int but it is of chars bytes and b in the printf call the chars will be converted to int and would the high bit of the chars be a 1 it would be sign-extended which we don t want
while sync is paused your google drive folder acts more like a normal directory

how can i make it so the elements nested within my div can be altered by mathjax to convert from tex to html
in your code parentarray is the value returned by malloc and this is the value that needs to be passed to free
for beautifulsoup the code like as following the lxml is more quickly
if you want to do int division use double slash if you want to convert whatever into int without knowing whether it can use this function def try_int v try return int v except valueerror return v then you ll be able to convert only those that are able to be converted into int into int
its enough to use data attribute and with a little work with add removeclass you ll be done next snippet to test the code working correctly or not by using settimeout the click stops and you ve to wait 3 second after click the code after added ajax to it
strangely i get different values for the frame width and height for both views when i printed them to stdout main view width 768.0 height 1024.0 second view width 375.0 height 667.0 i do not understand why these values are not equal because both views have the same size when running and the grey second view is greater than a width of 375
unsigned types at least as wide as unsigned int do not undergo integer promotions so arithmetic and logical operations on them is applied in their own type for which johan lundberg s answer applies that s specified to be performed modulo 2 n
when is added to a the semantics is governed by 6.5.6 8 which says that pointer arithmetic can be used to add to or subtract from a pointer as long as the result points to another element in the same array or to one beyond the last element
spray json library as it is typical for a scala library is more typesafe than jackson

regular addition and multiplication are already available and fma can be significantly slower than regular multiplication and addition on some platforms
if someone more familiar with mocha sinon could help me figure out how to do this i would greatly appreciate it
when reading the header you need to specify the number of characters of the magic number to read to be used with strcmp the last byte in the array must be set to 0 when writing the header you need to write it as an string printf out_file s d d d header.magic_number header.height header.width header.max_color
jmeter results average min max time shows more time than the service server average min max actual results aws lambda end point
solution i have tried to build a script that first check known width and height of those no image images which i put into an array together with the size in bytes
for example a system that can be implemented in mysql or postgresql but you want to have a case for test and for production at the case you will have 4 cases
my file dump.sql for mysql mysql dump 10.13 distrib 5.7.20 for win64 x86_64 in file set encoding cp1251 error in the normal recovery error invalid byte sequence for encoding utf8 0xd3 0xc0 i need to convert it so that it can be restored in postgresql
the footer height is set to height 40px and in google-chrome is ok however in firefox is smaller around 35px
the reason is that firefox find the textarea somewhat higher than google-chrome does and as such there is no space for the footer
in this case the int with 32 bits is bigger than 1 chars with 16 bit
since i don t know how long the text will be i want all the available text to be filled up in columns according to the available space column width can be fixed max height is the viewport height
at least couple of reasons comes to my mind you need to work with c code library and pass pointer there that expected to be initialized by malloc you are limited with resources and want to be able to use realloc with it there could be more but you need to be careful when working with raw pointers either initialized by new or malloc
also you need to remember that with malloc you need to be sure that memory is properly initialized it can be done with memset or simple assignments with pod types or and this is mandatory for non pod through placement new
it feels like celery is the project intended to be exposed not kombu
i was trying to loops through the results in a for-loop in script and could not what entity to loops on i was hopping that scripts have something like the update api has ctx.payload.hits.hits that can be used in for-loop
strncpy is more safe than strcpy because you limit the amount of bytes to be copied thus avoiding a buffer overflow
my problem is when i am tring to run app in iphone 4s is getting an error fatal error double value cannot be converted to int because the result would be greater than int.max
in your code you have created buttons programmatically and you haven t specified any width or height for them
in this case maybe calling combobox hide will also work this assumption is correct as you can see if you change the selection by keyboard in which case the dropdown is not open the combo is still accessible by keyboard and mouse
on the other hand the following works for keras and can be modified to tensorflow presumably without using tf.train.server according to keras + tensorflow and multiprocessing in python
this is vbscript which can be pasted into vb6
no need to set fixed height and width for edittext here
a normal linear regression model yields practically the same results as an anova but is much more flexible regarding variable choice
doing the following in the child process for that purpose is pointless that is because this child_group is just a copy in the child process the child_group in the parent process doesn t get modified sigkill has to be send to the pgid that corresponds to the child s pid because it becomes a process group leader by means of setsid
this causes the property to be #returned by get not used in post put patch
or what is so broken with autotools that they feel the need to break my build because my version of automake is newer than the package was configured with
so i am wondering if there is a way to create a specific node_modules folder or sub-folder one for each branch in order to have scoped directory
some good ones i ve used are solr and xapian though if you re already familiar with whoosh it certainly sounds like the best option you proposed
the long answer is with a properly initialized array it still depends c in the expression will be promoted to int prior to computing the array index and the c standard mandates that a have a positive value regardless of whether type chars is signed or unsigned
from tfs 2015 update 3 upgrade your tfs if your versioning is lower than this update 3 there is a task named delete files you could add this task after visual studio test task to delete the .itrace files
but in this case base class may have implemented an inherited interface .hence its not mandatory for concrete subclassing to implement all methods that are there in base class as a result of inherited from the interface
you are setting the value of datareference in oncreate method which will be called after onstart method
i want to return different data types to abstract class bank but i can t do that .i did refer different return types of abstract method in java without casting this question because i have less experience in java therefore i did t understand that link s solution.please anyone help me to solve the issue code error test.java 18 error union is not abstract and does not override abstract method rateofinterest in bank class union extends bank test.java 19 error rateofinterest in union cannot override rateofinterest in bank float rateofinterest return type float is not compatible with int test.java 20 error incompatible types possible lossy conversion from double to float return 9.5
but sometimes postgresql is faster than mysql or mariadb now i think i m doing wrong things.
as here as i mention double is higher type it stores int float values as per you expected

see this virtualbox ticket you may have more luck with vmware as indicated in the comments
so better get used to fgets strtol and dynamic arrays in parsing while giving inputs
as of february 2018 installing brew on ubuntu mine is 17.10 machine is as simple as sudo apt install linuxbrew-wrapper then on first brew execution just type brew --help you will be asked for two installation options for recommended option type your passwd if your current user is in sudo group or if you prefer installing all the dependencies in your own home folder hit ctrl + d
the google c++ style guide states in the section about inherited that limit the use of protected to those member functions that might need to be accessed from subclassing
clearly we can see that width of column is not same as height of row
what it does is simply after each items content is subtracted share the negative space like this in the right column and 18 is the sum of all items flex-shrink value c gets 4 18 d gets 12 18 e gets 2 18 these values can either be calculated server-side and assigned inline or client-side using a script
what it means is that to setup a piping you need a parent-child relationship not that communication with pipe is only possible between parent and children
for example you could hide the ones that could not be loaded show a custom error image using background-image or style them as you wish like in this example the problem is that the spinner image you use initially might take some time to load
now width is less than height when i check getclientrect .width and getclientrect height which is expected but it now won t drag all the way to the end of my canvas unless i detect end of rotation and change my shapes offsety value to 65 and then it works fine
sum needs to be declares as double because int will treat truncate all decimals. 1 i need to be type-casted as double as i is int so 1 i will be treated as int so it ll give 1 for and 0 for all values
if you perform any math or bitwise operation on primitive data types that are smaller than int that is byte short or chars those values will be promoted to int before performing the operation
before shrinking pdf pages can be seen in portrait but after shrinking their orientation is changing to landscape

to be called an entity-relationship diagram a diagram has to distinguish the concepts of the entity-relationship model
converting those numbers which are taken as string can be done using atoi or strtol better choice as providing error checking
i am building a project in nodejs with express framework ejs as view engine i am stuck at a point where i need to upload images and i am using multer but the issue is i want to set a criteria where image is not uploaded to server if the image height or width is less than or more than preset size say earlier i used to do this seamlessly with codeignitor
i had a thought that could addition be faster than subtraction so i suggested above but just realized that the only difference then between adding and subtract is the inversion that takes place
- i suppose it make the children circles bigger than the parent circle
the code is correct apart from the #include string.h which should be 1 the problem is that when you press ctrl + d on your terminal your terminal might write something on the terminal which you cannot control and this output might be d after fgets returns null you do printf d n found
to fix this you have two options either have the caller of text provide a pointer to store the string to or have text malloc some memory for the string and return that relying on the calling function to free it when it is done
you can try expand barcode width and height if barcode height is less from standart
an alternative to implementing dispatch on multiple inherited is to flatten the hierarchy into a single class and give it a single method that takes a descriptor of what kind of import to do static dynamic etc. as its parameter in turn importtype enumeration could be enhanced with properties and methods directing the process of importing excel data into your application
as far as i know they can only be used with get requests and not with post
if the versioning is greater than what the app was made to handle show an upgrade prompt
for example varchar that is displayed in combobox has columns like computer laptop console and integer has columns 500 computer 450 laptop and 250 console and so user can put numerical values in jtextfiled 500 450 and 250 are not displayed but remembered when user selects one item from combobox and after user clicks on button the value that user has put in jtextfield are being multiplied to numbers in integer table whatever user chooses in jcombobox and then final result is shown in jlist or is jtable is better for such data representation
you can not directly connect outlet of any thing embedded in tablecell follow steps to perform code operation with outlets connected step 1- create a new tableviewcell class as below screenshot step 2- now assign created class to tableview cells in storyboard as below step 3- time to connect outlets in cells class created by normally dragging the tf to be connected in cells class output will be as below step 4- required coding re-update answer to access tf in viewdidload ---- my viewcontroller class --- my cells class ---- my storyboard --- simulator output

react-router-redux has got almost nothing to do with routing in reactjs and has more to do with redux
the problem i am facing is what if the start date is lesser than min createddate then the data i am getting is filtering but instead of that i need the grouping time from start date to the end date grouping in a range if there is no data for some months then the database should return 0
and as a result headers are similar to basic authentication bearer authentication should only be used over https ssl
my understanding is that malloc should return null or a pointer where it can be passed to free without causing an issue if size is 0

if your stack versioning is older you can upgrade stack by stack upgrade or your package manager if you install stack using it
using a for-loop if your constraint is that the usernames and passwords must be stored in arrays and you all this in a single test case your only solution is to use a loops
edit 3 in a comment below the linked solution from this stackoverflow question does not cover all the cases because the disable action prevent the keyup event to be triggered and - on the other side - the keydown event is to earlier because when the button is hit a new section is created obviously by another keydown handler somewhere else and no i cannot modify that handler directly
if you have rename installed a.k.a perl rename you can do it very simply with a one-liner including making the target directory sample output other_sh would be renamed to folder other_priv sample1_sh would be renamed to folder sample1_priv when you become more familiar with the switches that will become even shorter if you are not that familiar with perl there are two substitutions going on in the middle there separated by a comma the first substitution replaces which means start of line with the prefix folder
this is received on the react native side and it displays however i am reading the data on react native side as - it gives error json value nsnull cannot be converted into nsstring
found the issue the output element can t be hidden when rendering otherwise it will not work it s probably optimization feature and maybe because addclass don t wait for the class to be addded before next line is executed so the rendertext got not visible output
say we attempt to overload functions with arguments as int chars and another as chars int if i call the function with chars chars would this be ambiguous or call to chars int is more logical
statements you d have an even bigger mess with the parent process having 4 children and the children having between 3 and 0 children and the grandchildrens having between 2 and 0 children and so on
i could have used stateful session beans but injeting stateful beans in stateless beans will not work
upon request of this application a modal instance of qdialog should be displayed. since qapplication exec would block the entire application i simulate the event loop using the following code if my dll should now display a modal dialog it works partially with the following code the code after w.exec will actually be executed after the dialog was closed as intended
i get the same error either way. i am assuming that vb6 is giving me this error because the activex component needs to be registered with regasm and it is trying to register it with regsvr32
when you want to allocate memory via functions as malloc and calloc it is better that you use a variable for the size of memory to be allocated
catch an exception-handling only if you know how you can usefully continue even knowing that some previous step failed - and very often you can t so surrounding only top-level actions with try-catch there logging the exception-handling to some log file and informing the user often is the best thing you can do
when i import this object into my component the height and width are much smaller than the width of the screen
the approach is find time difference between each row in seconds if difftime is more than 60 than that row is in new group newgroup perform cumsum on newgroup to get group number of each row
one solution could be achieved using sqldf and dplyr packages
you can have a look here operator precedence to see nice table that shows that casting has a higher priority than multiplication and addition - this is the reason why is put in parenthesis for casting this way you avoid casting only math.random ps
first virtualenv needed to be installed conda install virtualenv i actually had to ru nthat multiple times before i got # all requested packages already installed
children will be checked when parent box is checked in case you need and i think it makes sense
i have more than 3 hadoop batches including sqoop hive pig jobs and these batches are scheduled sequentially
i have tried the following approach draw a bounding rectangle around the nonzero pixels in the image and apply condition based on its height and width my code is something like draw a rotated rectangle and and then do the same procedure for condition check using its width and height. code the problem is that in most of the cases the horizontal aligned text has a rectangle with height greater than width and vice-versa therefore incorrect structuring size is applied and hence the system fails to join the correct contours in morphological operation
originally i was using the vue.component method in my main app.js file to require numerous single file components which were only used once as children of other parent components
note that merely storing and retrieving amounts of currency is fairly simple and it can be done with integer formats or floating-point formats as long as you follow the guidelines above
oozie is tightly coupled with hadoop nodes and all the scripts need to be uploaded to hdfs whereas airflow with celery executor has a better architecture
uicollectionview inherits from uiscrollview so you can modify the collectionview.contentsize to be the less than the width or height depending which way you don t want it to scroll of its parent view and it won t scroll
in short new statements can be generated using owl axioms serialized into rdf and stored in same triplestore owl constructs can be supported more or less partially
in your current schema that means running two queries first to retrieve reported post ids from your reports collection matching the user and then running the query like if you are able to just put the reports in the user schema it s easier as it saves a query but i recognize there are cases where it s better to have them in their own collection too
and then i join this range with my max value on where the range values are smaller than my max value
textblob is almost twice as slow as nltk but stores only the words from the tokenized list
this is because your image has a higher width than height
might be your service server setup would be configured with get but your are trying to access it with post from ajax

i m trying to choose between put cases case_id schedule get cases case_id schedule and put schedules cases case_id get schedules cases case_id could you please give advice
then the trick is to make the whole svg to overflow with big width height to always cover the div and to keep the same size of the circle if you want the circle to be resized on width change you can try this and you can easily have the opacity you needed in the previous question
but when i run the algorithm i get the following exception error using max int can only be combined with int of the same class or scalar double i m not sure what my issue is either
however because the thumbnail images are a set width and portrait images are different proportions they have a much greater height than the landscape ones when scaled down which obviously looks very wrong
what you are looking for is a layout bucket with the smallest width qualifier . a layout with a set smallest width will be active unless the smaller of the both dimensions width or height is lower than a certain value you can choose
the set accessor is more complicated because you ll need to loop over the attribute cache for the properties and call each attribute s check method
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case

the section of that file that contains the info for __gi_raise has the following attributes that indicate where the source code might be found on ubuntu 16.04 ubuntu doesn t ship source code in the base distribution so your systemd doesn t have any glibc source in build glibc-cl5g7w glibc-2.23 so gdb looks unsuccessfully for raise.c in a few other directories according to its rules specifying source directories and eventually gives up with the error message 54 .. sysdeps unix sysv linux raise.c no such file or directory. then ddd calls sourceview full_path .. sysdeps unix sysv linux raise.c to canonicalize the pathname taking your working directory into account and displays the error dialog box in your question
in the second step i read the children match document by parent id and update with child.
if anyone could explain why the for-loop is faster than the direct access of the arrays that would be great. for reference the shape of matrix_n is 48 100 100 30 and the shape of matrix is 48 30 100 100 so in the second method im simply building the arrays from the 2nd dimension and in the first method the arrays is already built
i suggest to use idling resources to handle async ops anyway exception-handling is a checked exception-handling so it should be wrapped with try-catch or method should define that exception-handling with throws keyword. to fix your compiler error you may use runtimeexception or error
a very generic solution can be achieved using dplyr and tidyr packages
and as others posted here there also appears to be many plugins making that even simpler a few of which show up in those searches i listed above such as min max quantity please see if you try implementing those hit a wall and cant find anything after searching for a while to work around it
if your linked list must be sorted using comparator then you need to make sure that the underlying data is comparable
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0
like if max 20 than you can enter maximum 20 character. and here min is lower bound so you have to enter minimum 4 character
otherwise i would not be surprised if malloc free internally holds a similar array or linked list of recently used memory blocks ready to be recycled
since the classes may get recycled or the groovy class loader isolation magic loads it differently our environment eclipse neon 3 uses groovy 2.4.5 internally starts with a jdk 1.8.0_121 jaspersoft studio 6.3.2.final we have a 6.3.0 server but full neon support was added in 6.3.1 so we took the last patch versioning of 6.3.x we had issues before where newer studio versioning did not work with older servers so we are more careful with upgrade here may be irrelevant it was enough to just depend on the slf4j api 1.7.12 in our case in the pom.xml we have both provided jasper libraries added to the project jaspersoft server library jasperreports library dependencies we also depend on server functionality so we also have jasperreports-6.3.0.jar in the pom.xml and some not via some public maven repo available server jars as a user library to the project which we copied over from the server no groovy reference in the pom.xml
the fix is to redirect stderr or redirect both stdout and stderr background when processes are initially created they generally always have three initial file descriptors already opened for them 0 stdin standard input a read-only stream 1 stdout standard output a write-only stream 2 stderr standard error a write-only stream there is precisely zero difference between stdout and stderr other than convention and the file descriptor number

this can be accomplished with dplyr and tidyr packages although it is a bit involved
if your conditions are true that only the lines you need are longer than 12 chars and that the lines you are interested are always of the same format no spaces between the commas second column is always quotes as the ones posted in your answer then you can parse it like this now the interesting bits are these strtol is a function that converts a number in a string to an actual int
google-chrome is more picky about js errors than firefox
this seems like a step backwards as aes is the current standard while 3des is no longer recommended
if the next versioning is published will the users of previous versioning be asked to upgrade to the latest versioning without any code for upgrade except the versioning detail
the values really seem to be correct in the landscape the r value is bigger than in portrait
according to tensorflow 1.5 installation instructions for ubuntu 16.04 you need to install cudnn 7.0 but they don t mention exactly what should be installed cudnn v7.0
u is the free parameter but its range is limited by the third equation sin v sqrt 1 γ cosh u + cos α sin α sinh u this can be rewritten as sin v -sin alpha sinh u sqrt 1-y cosh u +cos alpha knowning that abs sin v 1 gives a condition for u
why matrix in i+1 is not defined meanwhile it works properly for matrix i simply because of your for-loop condition value of i can go upto matrix.length -1 and will always be undefined as arrays indexing starts from 0
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0
also note that and delegates will also need to be included libtiff ghostscript and freetype for example if your planing to support additional formats features
the idea is set the component s width to the available width the height you set do not matter so i just pass zero and get preferred height will be the height for the wrapped content
- + - and then set udp port 4000 to be decoded as rtp by selecting rtp under the current column
also in drawrect what you do with the while loops is correct but a for-loop is more common for this purpose
the documentation mentions that the server needs to be run with daphne and daphne needs an asynchronous version of uwsgi named asgi
and then set height 50 to elements in your columns i add a margin it looks better
personally if i were going to use the button idea as you ve described i would probably have hidden checkbox and use client-side javascript to check uncheck them as the button or image is pressed
have discovered that dax is the wrong place to implement this - we are doing this in mdx
safari says enter a valid value. google-chrome says please enter a valid value
i think your image height is much greater than match_parent its attr. and again imageview s scale type forces image to resize width in accordance to its height and hence the blank space
yes on most cpus sha-256 is two to three times slower than md5 though not primarily because of its longer hash

--a union approach seems more straight forward if you can guarantee that only status 2 records get mapped the union could be a union all to gain a bit of performance by avoiding the distinct
this gets to be a headache because of git s default behavior that once you exclude a folder any exceptions within it will never be found directory vs directory
in your case writes 5 as int which has a bigger size than chars 2 4 8 depends
if a is false then nothing is said about b which seems right for case expressions and may mean the same as or it may have the meaning for functions given below which is means the function f maps the set x into the set y so my guess is that idris just uses for the narrow second meaning for mapping one type to another in type signatures whereas haskell uses the broader interpretation where it means the same as
if you want to run commands from your terminal interactively as root do it as follows sudo -i if just want to run a single command do it as sudo some-command-goes-here you will not be prompted for passwd in any of these scenario
in your class constructor this capacity++ will first return the capacity and then increase its value by one. because of this when you are filling your arrays in a for-loop you are going out of arrays range because your arrays size is 1 less than the capacity value
while-loop syntax if we have only single statement to execute within our loops i.e in our case while-loop then we can either write form 1 or we can write it as form 2 while expression statement 1 note if we write one more statement below statement 1 in form 2 then it will not be executed within loops body

you can create a custom iequalitycomparer that only compares on the column needed and use the except that takes an iequalitycomparer as an argument or you can use exceptby from morelinq or you could do your own exceptby equivalent public function check_desparity byval dtteststeps as datatable byval dtlimits as datatable as ienumerable of datarow dim dtteststepshash as new hashset of string dtteststeps.asenumerable.select function dr ctype dr dictkey string return dtlimits.asenumerable.where function dr not dtteststepshash.contains ctype dr dictkey string end function i assumed column dictkey was of type string but you can just put in the correct type
accessing hard-disk takes you from the realm of caches and ram to that of disk which is slower by orders of magnitudes
on the php page they can then be retrieved using post or get if that s how they were sent originally some calculations performed and then sent back
example i have one web page which displays contents which will be break into several pages for printing the first 2 part of contents will be printed in portrait and the others will be printed in landscape
whereas the first code prints 291.0 83.0 83.0 the second code prints 4671.0 123.0 123.0 ideone demo because the f on 0x123f is considered a hex digit and the leading 0 on 0123f and 0123d doesn t cause floating point numbers to be considered in octal
if you only generate a thumbnail i would recommend moving image loading into the promise as well as that makes more sense over all since image loading is asynchronous. now you can use the call as any promise or also a small note by separating the header from the data-uri it s no longer a data-url just a base-64 encoded string - something to consider for the function name
before this lines there are more than 6k typedef struct like this and even that i make comments over each typedef struct to catch the mistake i couldn t figure out how
additional benefit is that when you ve processed few millions of input data pages these gbs will be unloaded from ram and you ll never need them again so you won t pollute actual disk cache
if you do not want use conda instead virtualenv select virtualenv but virtualenv from miniconda as far as miniconda is more tested and work out of the box without such errors
but i would suggest to use the following the max function so that all the points are covered in the maximum value of x and y provided x y are always less than width and height
i am a microsoft fan but mssql server costs much more than postgresql or mysql
short int is an int type so bullet #2 kicks in and causes generation of a wrapper which calls double abs double and this wrapper is a better match than int abs int
depending on the scale a tree-fold rather than a strict left-fold can improve the performance of doing lots of multiplication because multiplying numbers of approximately the same magnitude is more efficient than multiplying one large and one small number
hiding dropdowns can be done with -webkit-appearance none note that these vendor prefixes are unique to their corresponding browsers so if you were to apply -webkit-appearance none like above the dropdowns will be hidden on google-chrome but still visible on firefox
modulus operation will be done using primes arrays instead of numberlist arrays i am running first for-loop till 10 6 which will be enough to give first 10001st primes

you can either decorate your productviewmodel with the bind attribute as follows this will of course mean all the properties in the tblproduct will be bound when submission if you do not want all of the properties to be bound on submit for tblproduct then you can decorate the tblproduct with the bind attribute as follows more reading at msdn
as far as i know this problem occur when we paste image from explorer to drawable folder then it ask weather to copy drawable or drawable-v24 and if you have pasted images in both directory structures or have one more images with different directory structure then it will show this error make sure to copy image only in drawable directory structure
data is therefore persistent while selections can be considered transient you can reselect elements from the dom and they will retain whatever data was previously bound to them
this can be done employing tidyr package included in tidyverse in r
it isn t a great solution because client-side code should generally be decoupled with server-side code and with this approach you ll have to manage your routes at both the client and the server ends but it will do what you want perhaps
i have two tables with same width and number of in one row with same css for both tables but as you see in snippet first column of both tables are aligned properly but other columns are shifted left from heading here i want a table with fixed headings at top and content part has scroll if content height is more than 100px
also since the whole point of this thing seems to be to have a faster sort than std stable_sort and std sort due to qsort avoidance of assignment operator btw qsort is generally slower than std sort for cheap comparers because it requires an indirect call for each compare while in std sort the functor gets inlined. and copying is often slower as well as std sort has to use memcpy which has to be called and then to determine at runtime the size and copy accordingly while an inlined assignment gets inlined so again it s way cheaper if your elements are small and pretty much the same otherwise as the synthesized assignment copy of trivially assignable types generally boils down to memcpy chat link
however in case you have to use ui elements which are not automatable by selenium i would recommend to use sikuli for c#
you can also clone to your main python site-packages the application s commands in order to have the auto-completation. if i remember nuke has already a clone for autocompletion but maya is more tricky
this means we will have more height than width on this page so width is decisive for a quadratic frame
it works even better when the power is higher but might not be good with powers smaller than 1 indeed pow is a really slow function even slower than sqrt which make sense since any sqrt operation could be done with pow using a fraction as exponent there is no way to compute the power exactly more efficiently but there are pretty good way to estimate it
the problem is when the items count gets more than views height every item that is in the view will get a width of highest content i mean all will get wrap content of highest width
here is my code the xml layout for items code snippet that does the fragment replace and the mainpageframelayout the adapter and the oncreateview images edit image explanation as you can see in image 1 when items numbers gets more than views height items width gets wrap_content instead of match_parent image 2 is the correct one that it should be in image 3 as you can see after i did scroll items that get s re-instantiated gets correct width
here is a slightly more complex example with chars int instead of a and b the function lt in sortwith behaves like the second function g2fun whereas the function aux2 that you have written is more like the g1fun
there is always a chars at the beginning of the string but it may or may not be followed by int
in oop interfaces usually specify behaviour methods which cannot trivially be translated to rdf owl

it can be done through sympy which will call mpmath it s not quite clear how you plan to plot this function given that it s complex-valued
because the 1st example also has double i d expect all of those elements to be converted to double as well and the sum being 2.0 before being cast to 2 but the result is 0 so it seems the 1 2 is being treated as int giving a result of 0
it would be awesome to get your help to debug this and here is what i ve put together so far
the conditions that i am looking for is when 2 is included in the parent array and children value is less than 2 where the children value is highest and parent count is lowest among the sufficing documents
that way any value will be larger than your min and smaller than your max
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility the history is rebuilt much better and cleaner by svn2git if the correct one is used this is especially the case for more complex histories with branches and merges and so on the tags are real tags and not branches in git you can generate annotated tags instead of lightweight tags with git-svn the tags contain an extra empty commit which also makes them not part of the branches so a normal fetch will not get them until you give --tags to the command as by default only tags pointing to fetched branches are fetched also
with the proper svn2git tags are where they belong if you changed layout in svn you can easily configure this with svn2git with git-svn you will loose history eventually with svn2git you can also split one svn repository into multiple git repositories easily or combine multiple svn repositories in the same svn root into one git repository easily the conversion is a gazillion times faster with the correct svn2git than with git-svn you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior

i think this issue is more common with postgresql databases than mysql databases because with postgresql there is more likely to be lagging connections this is a postgresql issue rather than gcp issue
for example the cypher query you have above would be written in gremlin as g.v .has name you .as you .out friend .as yourfriends .select you yourfriends currently you would need to translate your cypher queries to gremlin to work against any number of tp databases including janusgraph cosmosdb dse graph aws neptune..
gcc clang msvc and icc all compile this to basically the same thing this is smarter than clang s code putting the mov to eax before the cmov creates instruction-level parallelism
the following code do such task but lag in some case unfortunately i get this output including spaces in between the arrays entries one two three but what i actually need is this onetwothree background i try to avoid using a for-loop and concatenate it on my own cause i call this very often more than each second and i guess such a loops is much more expensive than use a build-in function
the exceptions are those that the jvm can generate such as nullpointerexception arrayindexoutofboundsexception negativearraysizeexception arraystoreexception arithmeticexception as well as common exceptions from the runtime library that shouldn t normally be caught unchecked-exception such as illegalargumentexception nosuchelementexception etc
a post is semantically better than get because the concept of a job is to do some processing rather than getting something for you
if you want them parsed to int this will work mind you that there should be some error checking here the above example will crash if any of the chars cannot be parsed to int
changing app theme requires settheme method to be called before setcontentview .. in the oncreate method of the activity
as a rule of thumb you should use the prototype scope for all beans that are stateful while the singleton scope should be used for stateless beans
since the height of all children combined is greater than that of wrapper div i want the parent to be able to scroll
it cannot be supplied except from the list to be analyzed. next the basis of a tail recursive function is the accumulator. the accumulator is where the last min or max value is stored and passed to the the function to compare to the next value of the list. a basic function could be the first parameter is a guess at a value higher than any in the list and is destined to fail and cannot be automated

by the looks of the browser compatibility table at the bottom of the mdn documentation page array.prototype.values won t be supported until google-chrome 66 and firefox 60 - neither of which have been released yet
if the number is revised 1519490351963 this exceeds the greater value of an int 2147483647 so there is no conversion to whole a possible solution is to convert it to double another possible solution is to convert it to qvariant and then use tolonglong to use qlonglong which is a type of int that supports more bits
like described in this question iterating an arrays with a for-loop is less cheaper than using a foreach
so to bind step to simulationparametersconfig.param1.step you would change to naturally the same could be done to min and max as well
the basic problem is that i am using word32 to represent the package length and one of the pcap packets is shorter than 47
perhaps you are thinking about the initializer functions that convert between strings and int values and vice versa using an arbitrary radix but that only applies when the hex string is less than 8 chars can be represented in 64 bits
i have these value so what i m doing is that i m generating a random number between min and max with these rules min not less than 100 max not more than 800 i only want to have +200 from previous or -200 from previous so for the above example the random number should be between min 100 and max 370
as this particular machine could easily buffer 20 gbytes in ram we shall do another run with to force any data that may only have been in the kernel s ram cache at the end of the run to be pushed to disk thus ensuring we record the time it took for all the data to actually reach non-volatile storage ok now the speed has dropped to about 1.9 gbytes s and we still use all a cpu but the disk in the raid device claim they had capacity to go faster
the general feel has always been that nginx is lighter and easier to configure but on the flip side perhaps isn t as fully featured as apache because of that
you can assign a new arrays of true values with the same element count but interestingly assigning true values in a for-loop is much faster
firefox column floated right issue image i am using firefox quantum 58.0.2 64bit and have tried latest google-chrome edge and opera which works fine
you can compare two byte arrays without for-loop using zip method but it will create a new list so it will be slower than the for-loop method
the recursive settimeout is a more flexible method than setinterval
indexeddb data can be viewed within google-chrome firefox and opera developer tools
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0. element to be clickable elementtobeclickable by locator an expectation for checking an element is visible and enabled such that you can click it. note as per the docs element is clickable - it is displayed and enabled
a double for-loop would do but i found that eigen vectorxd s are faster than hand-written loops
you can use the appropriate integer literal suffix to force the foo to be deduced as unsigned long

first i would recommend using uicollectionview uistackview for this issue second changing frame width won t help every item appended should have leading constraint to the previous trailing top bottom trailing to contentview then scrollview will autoresize to show that added item
when int i is declared outside the for-loop it can be accessed outside the for-loop and inside but when you define it inside loops it can only be used inside loops
clemens already gave you a handful of options to remedy this situation in the comments section but let me quickly go over them set width and height of your ellipse to the same value - this is limiting since you have to hard-code the size of your control bind the width to the actualheight of the ellipse or the other way around - this gives you some extent of dynamic behavior but things go bad if the target dimension constraint is smaller than the source dimension constraint if you bind width to actualheight things go bad when your control is contained within a rectangle with its width smaller than its height - the ellipse is clipped put the ellipse in a square container - or more precisely within a container that would always arrange it in a square i strongly recommend the last approach since it gives you full flexibility in sizing your control
you can see the relative sizes of them on your particular computer using this simple program if you run that you re going to notice that the chars is smaller than the int
if you really want your variables to be chars you need to first use scanf to store them into an int and then assign the values to your resulting chars while you re checking that they re in range since an int can hold a bigger number than a chars

when ns_enum makes a difference if you are writing objective-c which will be used by swift then using ns_enum does make a difference an enum declared using ns_enum will be imported as a swift enum
iqueryable is faster than ienumerable if we are dealing with huge amounts of data from database because iqueryable gets only required data from database where as ienumerable gets all the data regardless of the necessity from the database
i have no interest in using node.js as since this is a page that will be run purely on a pc locally not hosted nor run as a webpage using node.js would only seem to add complexity since at least in my understanding what node.js does is allow javascript to be executed server-side instead of client-side
i have come across a strange c++ crash recently after upgrading to gcc 7.2 which can be demonstrated using the following simple complete c++11 program the program can be built using g++ -std c++11 -o2 when executed with no arguments - program takes the top branch and crashes when built with gcc6.1 or later
so while cf types are not classes objects they act like objects and several are actually interchangeable with objective-c and swift objects
to avoid these linkage errors you must inform your c++ compiler when it compiles the header file s of libeapi that the declarations therein have external c linkage so it will emit unmangled references to the symbols declared like so main.cpp btw this commandline g++ -o secotest -lpthread main.o libeapi.a will fail to link libpthread on a debian-based distro ubuntu et al more recent than debian 6 as all libraries must be linked in dependency order since then g++ -o secotest main.o libeapi.a -lpthread even better do not use the non-portable -lpthread and pass the portable option -pthread for both compilation and linkage
when creating a new socket the desired protocol must be specified tcp udp etc. which may go over ipv4 ipv6 etc

i recommend using m2e when working with maven in eclipse
if cardetails is immutable but not readonly it can be updated by parent you can start from constructor param then extend the behavior of the children to handle something like cardetailsupdated message send by the updating actor to replace the old state with a new one
so it should be hu for unsigned short int
math.h defines m_log2e to the value of log e if you define _use_math_defines before inclusion of math.h even though usual approach is to do log n log 2 i would advise to use multiplication instead as division is always slower especially for floats and more so on mobile cpus
on mobile arm cpus i would expect floating point division to be somewhere 10-100 slower than multiplication

as far as i know there is no such single function for this in dplyr but assuming that what you are referring to is this complex join shown in sql which for any row i computes the mean demand of those rows whose time points are between and library sqldf sqldf select a.time a.demand demand avg b.demand mean_demand from bod a join bod b on b.time between a.time - 2 and a.time grouping by a.time then this could be done in dplyr and tidyr like this although it does have the significant disadvantage that it forms the full n x n cross join and then filtering it down

keep in mind that each chars can be presented as int it s an ascii code
i have also tried layout fill it maintains aspect ratio but it creates padding if the given height width is larger than original image s height width
instead of trying to convert database values to desired culture - convert your input to the culture database expects if you will go this route - you might notice that there might actually be no need to convert number back to string because since you now know it s a number - you can compare it with equals and not tostring .contains ... like you are doing now
it is pretty much possible that the line with webelement.gettext would work but the line with webelement.click won t work as follows explaination the reason for this behavior is when the client the web browser returns back the control to the webdriver instance once document.readystate equals to complete is achieved it is quite possible that the intended webelement is present element is present but does not necessarily mean that the element is interactable and visible element is visible and also has a height and width that is greater than 0
i am pretty sure all is clear and should work as it is expected but for some reason when i use the app and lock the auto rotation and run the app it is automatically opening in portrait mode and when i unlock the autorotation it will be in landscape and you rotate it will be rotated to portrait mode
1 do.call using do.call the a arguments could be constructed using rep
i ve built a carousel and i want the images to max out the screen in one dimension width if the width of the image is greater than the height and height if vice versa
comma should be allowed in firefox but for google-chrome it s a bit tricky you need to use and validate if the input is a number or not manually using javascript
your highest temperature will be stored in max and your lowest in min
even though this is labeled var and not let it will still be read-only because you have only specified a getter you could have specified a setter with a set block below the get block
detect if at max width you ll probably want to check if the document s width is lesser than the screen width you can t do this with height however as the browser has reserved vertical space for tabs and toolbar and there is no way of getting the height of those
works on webkit and blink browsers is a better solution because it doesn t break atbitrarily but only if necessary in case of one long string not separated by spaces that exceeds the allowed width limits
this type should be used for server-side applications. public public access type is for client-side clients that need to perform a browser login
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
string#trim is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace so the following work fine but if the user enters only whitespace that s fine too various representations of true false are used to determine boolean-ness ranges of byte short and float are used to box the value in the narrowest type available default type is string but if the equation is parsable by the javascript scriptengine if will be parsed and the result will be returned if the input string has length 1 and is not boolean or byte it will be assigned the chars type possible extensions might include putting a flag for the formula evaluation or a flag which would restrict returned types to common types boolean int double string
that an import aspect data should be easily readable with getter setter just as a regular dataframe is
you can imagine the markup looks like so the above produces the results as expected in google-chrome even without using page specifically - seems like google-chrome is better with setting default margins whereas i am struggling to find a solution in safari
the actual thing that does the writing in the iostreams api is std ostream it s also easier to remember to use and write rather than deal with the maze of cryptically named functinos that is the streambuf api
max roughly close and below to virt memory max min used roughly close to res memory don t quote me on this but virt mem is roughly close to or more than max memory allocated but as long as memory being used is free available in physical memory jvm does not throw memory exception
see that msdn sample first option is most convenient due automatic serializable deserialization 2nd one is more flexible as not all xml schemas can be achieved by serializable attributes
malloc must be matched with free and new must be matched with delete
if we take another example for int type first two pointer initializations work as int without any specifier is equivalent to signed int but this is not true with chars and therefore types are compatible
however if the folder has more folder it includes them as well but i want to only include the files in the directory that was entered by the user
visibility means that the elements are not only displayed but also have a height and width that is greater than 0
since i m using an older client with identityserver4 in order to enable .net 4.x webapps to authenticate through identityserver4 cannot easily use .net core with those projects - luckily identityserver4 is still compatible with the older client code the action that triggers signout has two relevant things and you ll find a ton of examples of code for that will not work for you with mvc in .net 4.x use the signout method in this sample github repo the identityserver3 mvc owin sample client you can trigger that action from a button in a view
as stated by pablo morra on a comment of the simplabs post using npm libraries in ember cli third party npm modules can be imported on ember.js from version 2.15 directly without the need of addons or wrappers unfortunately documentation is still on work and it doesn t say that npm modules can be imported only bower and vendor ones i ve gotten 2 solutions to import third party npm modules directly on ember.js from the ember cli documentation about managing dependencies although it s also out-of-date and says that npm modules can t be imported only bower and vendor ones npm module as standard anonymous amd asset amd asynchronous module definition i prefer and use this way because it avoids global variables and follows the import convention of ember.js
so the height cannot be fixed height or these will be way too tall when the divs are full width
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined
this can be cast to int float or double
at the same time we need to substract that difference to the biased exponent and check for underflow or subnormal cases and renormalize the number left shift the mantissa and decrement exponent until the firs one in the mantissa goes to the hidden bit place note i assumed the biased exponent of the modulo is lower than the one of the number to be operated on as in the other case the mask is all ones and the number is not affected by the mask
after the interpreter entered that line the first time it is inevitable that an indexerror occurs since length - 1 the upper limit of x in your for-loop now is larger than the last index of list1 two possible solutions capture the indexerror and break the for-loop then use a while-loop like this
the instagram api mentions this the one thing to keep in mind is that all requests to the api must be made over ssl https not but then their example goes on to use an http callback registered redirect uri
this is kind of funny considering the worry of 1000 bytes which is 1kb system ram is likely to be in gb s and because of disk file caching everything is likely to be loaded into ram anyway. but here s a way to run through the file and find what would be the maximum number of characters on what would be considered a line once you know the max length of a line you can either do one malloc knowing the minimum value you need.
this is to avoid using the global attribute which implies poor data design update code credits to john coleman for spotting the problem in initial idea to use 1 sin a sin a +cos a cos a that would have been actually sin time+delta f sin time delta but it fails for 50 of a full period
i would have opted for racket which is a ide and an implementation of many scheme standard languages
in particular i assume i have a data frame set with a double column denoted as data and an int column named censorflag 0 value if censored 1 if not prefer this over boolean type
if you add the jsonobject attribute to the page class it will be serializable to asp.net mvc still uses the rather old javascriptserializer whose description is json.net should be used serializable and deserialization
so the application will returns error on two condition if either numbers are negative value if maximum number is less than minimum number this is my code showing the method generate number when i input max 10 and min 1 it returns false
i don t want to force landscape when webview is loaded as there are other web pages that are used that need to be shown in portrait
your problem by default your int gets promoted to an unsigned int according to the usual arithmetic conversions ... if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
and ...if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
it is likely that the form submission will be sent in post instead of get
like multiplication and division modulo arithmetic has a higher precedence than addition
for width 100 in some screen margin 10px is more then 1 so
if you re not comfortable with django yet consider starting with flask instead as it s simpler to get going
i have a div with unknown width and height this div is one of the children of a bigger div but the problem is that the overlay div is not fit at all and it s way bigger than its parent #mydiv while its width and height are 100
these consist only of promoting int types smaller than int to int or unsigned int and promoting float s to double
i was trying to compare it with for-loop but i don t know how to write code so that arrays checks it s own strings for duplicates without already pre-determined string to compare
firstly you shouldn t use border-radius of 50 that would make an oval when the width is larger than its height you should use a fixed value such as 30px
first of all i d like to point out that hiding what powers your web app isn t really worth the time or effort with that said if you really really want to there are a couple of things you could try changing the defaults of apache tell all behaviour with these directives assuming you are using apache not really familiar with nginx servertokens prod serversignature off php will add a x-powered-by http header if expose_php was set to on in your php.ini file
for starters according to the c standard the function main without parameters shall be declared like int main void after this statement in the body of the loop each element of the array top5 points to the first chars of the array name
then consider the image to be portrait if the height is greater than the width
set this for your imageview do not use layout_editor_absolutey and layout_editor_absolutex at all because they don t compiled into your app they are in tools namespace you should change your xml like this if you have just two textview and one imageview at all put your constraintview in a scrollview but if you have lots of textview and imageview it is a better idea to use cardview
i assume that the pull request concept is only for the public repositories as a private repository can be controlled push pull update closely with my team members
i assume that the pull request concept is only for the public repositories as a private repository can be controlled push pull update closely with my team members
the output is fully compatible with opennlp stanford-nlp etc
in short if your json response is quite small go with gson otherwise jackson is better
client side cache can be updated by push notification instead of pull
so my question is does the latest version of yourkit does something more then jmc so i can argument my project to argument to pay the licenses..
with the partial justification that lists are not an efficient data structure for storing large amount of data note that haskell lists are lazy and thus are quite different than ocaml eager lists
do it until height width is less than 10
as others already mentioned calling a function repeatedly can be achieved using setinterval and stopping it can be done using clearinterval
maybe important to note that mouseout could also be replaced with mouseleave and similarly for mouseover and mouseenter
enable_coverage is command line flag which i use to enable disable code coverage which will be generated using lcov gcov
remove fixed width and height from the main content that s what s causing overflow of child elements
how can a .vue file as a parent component with child .vue files be published to npm so that you can install require and use it as a component with bower as i only use bower
package org.yaml.snakeyaml.external.biz.base64coder does not exist means that you do not have the dependency specified in your pom.xml file or is not discoverable by maven
however it seems to be impossible to receive data in simulink since the com port appears to be occupied by matlab side
the way you are currently printing the result it will be printed in decimal which must then be converted to binary if that s desired though someone has offered a comment to assist you to get the output into hex
this is wrapping in contrast to saturating. in computer programming an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of bits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value
unit and integration tests use junit and can run on the jenkins master for the system tests we use testng and they can run the testfx tests on a jenkins agent. i think testng is more suited for system tests than junit development build project build unit+integration tests was already in place
you might have either deleted it or the new_charge route needs to be used as post and not get
in swift 4 objects are not implicitly inferred to be exposed to objective-c
i recently swiched from vim to spacemacs and am not yet very familiar with emacs spacemacs configuration customization. i have used cquery with vim before. my projects have a compile_commands.json
benchmarking explanation the reason why s.replace is so slow is that it does much more than simply map a dictionary
if yes as said in the comments there is the simple way just setting height bigger than width or using your way and un-rotating the content but i really can t understand why you need to rotate it
the code you have in the question rearranges array elements such that they satisfy the heap property the value of the parent node is greater than that of the children nodes
note based on well-received comments the repeat a for-loop is probably more correctly expressed as nest several for loops
the httpclient type is a newer implementation than the webclient and httpwebrequest
oss.clear here is the code here are the results now using std string is still faster and the append is still the fastest way of concatenation but ostringstream is no more so incredibly terrible like it was before
the -rtsp_transport can be setup as udp or tcp according to your streaming
because on most machines sizeof double is bigger than sizeof int so there s not enough room for the array elements after a while it should be
a simple and clear way to output the target chars of the third element of the array is or using the pointer arithmetic you can write here is a demonstrative program its output is r r take into account that according to the c standard the function main without parameters shall be declared like int main void
what you already have figured out d i used .map for this -- just a bit cleaner than a for-loop -- feel free to learn more about the .map method at once all the words have been reversed stitch the arrays back together into a string strarray.join
however if you are not able to connect to the database even once i suggest to check the following items do a ping command to your database ip from the server host do a telnet command to your database to see if you can reach the database port see if mysql does not have rules about which ips can talk to it i known that postgresql have this feature do not know if mysql does check that mysql does not have something like drop iddle connections.
use sudo lsof -i -n -p | more to view view only tcp connections sudo lsof -i -n -p | grep tcp | more to view view only udp connections sudo lsof -i -n -p | grep udp | more
note that microsoft s own documentation for javascriptserializer states json.net should be used serializable and deserialization
all tables are created when i run manage.py makemigrations but when i want to run manage.py migrate then is show this error django.db.utils.integrityerror not null constraint failed user_profile.user_id model.py views.py form.py
i want to setup and ivr menu i mean if a user calls to a particular gsm number then the number should be redirected to asterisk server and the user needs to get ivr menu i am using voiceblue next firmware version 1.31.1.34.1 inserted working sim card if i make a call to that particular number i am able to accept call reject call and other options from voicebluenext web interface
to do that you could do the following whereby i have not included the actual run of matlab but that trivially can be included submission this job using submit 3 jobs to the queue
in general i would recommend using post as a form s method instead of get
what you describe in your question as grouping is more correctly described as sorting
i have a div which im using it for different charts i also have 3 different button which supposed to show new chart on click here is my button the problem is when i want to click on btn1 i want the above main div to be cleared and show the following grid but if i use empty method it will not show anything in the div im looking for a method other than empty or hide to clear the div if there is any other grid or chart to show the grid on my btn1 button
i m trying to repeat n times an arrays with a for-loop but i ve been stuck in the last arrays that contains more elements
if i need to use a spy i d like to preferably know how to with jest but if a dep like sinon or jasmine is better suited for the job i m open to it just let me know why so i can better understand
you could do something like this html js jquery there is a change event on jquery but it s only called when the input has lost it s focus so using a keydown keypressed or keyup is better
this is exactly like the decision table above except the command is the one with an interface and subclasses - you don t need to do the switch because the command action subclass already has that logic for you for example if you need to make different decisions based on which command at multiple points int your code you might even want something as fancy as double dispatch which i won t go into here
i would like the children to be hidden when parent is clicked again but not when children are clicked
i also tried but that gives the error impl doesn t use types inside crate i could probably live without deserialization since serializable is more important at this point
swift version of the accepted answer lukas kukacka answer bonus under i added i had a problem where i would record in portrait get the thumbnail image and it would get returned in landscape
i want to store selected checkbox text to firebase when the button is clicked and go to another activity
by the way your integer is not such big consider sys.maxsize sys.maxsize in range sys.maxsize is pretty fast due to optimization - it s easy to compare given integer just with min and max of range
this shows two flaws if the replacement with that php value works it is evaluated on server side and therefore never replaced with the current value from the that is present on client side you seem to expect the value to be transferred via post but you use jquery .get to transfer it via get
but the image does not fit to the full width height when the image s width height is less than the width height values passed to initialize the object if the actual image s width height is more than the width height passed to initialize the object the image is cropped i want the image to fit in given width height
if the width is larger than the height i would like the width of the image to equal the width of the view with the top and bottom of the image being clipped off
if the height is larger than the width i would like the height of the image to match the height of the view with the sides being clipped off
so super will be assigned to self when it hits the base method
for instance an objective-c method that takes one or more pointer arguments could be refined in swift to return a tuple of values
assuming you re using swift 4 s objective-c inference darkgray must be declared objective-c you can access darkgray from objective-c using scheme1.darkgray
to do that i think first i have to get all the collections of documents not to be confused with tfs vsts collections in that extension
from pypi page protect python script work flow your_script.py import pyconcrete pyconcrete will hook import module when your script do import module pyconcrete import hook will try to find module.pye first and then decrypt module.pye via _pyconcrete.pyd and execute decrypted data as .pyc content encrypt decrypt secret key record in _pyconcrete.pyd like dll or so the secret key would be hide in binary code can t see it directly in hex view
sse2 is baseline for x86-64 and can be assumed in most 32-bit code these days so at least 128bit registers are available and can be used for 64bit integer add sub shift even in 32-bit mode with instructions like paddq
a solution can be achieved using tidyr complete and dplyr to repeat rows number of times mentioned in column n
whenever i create a program on sublimetext 3 and execute it a java.lang.classnotfoundexception will occur even if my code is completely correct and can be executed in notepad++
i create new blank image destination width 64 pixels and height also 64 pixels. then i want to resize source image so that width is 64 pixels and height is proportionally less
the case for the non-empty list is if the first element is less than a put that element in front of what you get from recursing on the tail of the list otherwise the result is just the result of recursing on the tail
if there is no clear breakpoint in the data i would like b1 to be estimated at min x and b2 at max x if there is no lower breakpoint i would like b1 to be estimated at min x and if there is no upper breakpoint i would like b2 to be estimated at max x
with a for-loop you don t need a separate increment seems like you are using while loops for if remember the variable used in while conditions must be manipulated within loops i have written a code to add values to a 2x3 arrays with all user inputs and it works fine -
this part works fine the problem is when more than one checkbox is selected the radio button act like they are all under the same name even though they aren t...when one is selected all the others become deselected when i only want the other ones under that name to become deselected
when properties names should be inferred by accessor by tools that rely on this standard then we might want to use it
in this case the downloaded date may not fit into ram and will be swapped to disk and this will slowdown the download process
in the case of very small inline functions or a large amount of subsequent optimization the resulting code may be even smaller after inlining since the remaining code if any may be smaller than the overhead involved in the calling the function 2
but requesting a rest resource and more particularly by a get method doesn t mean that the client is about terminating a workflow that makes more sense with post put methods
the children overflow their parent element because their intrinsic height the height of their contents is larger than the parent s height
you need a div as a wrapper for your webpage and set a fixed width or max-width if you want the content to be able to become smaller on smaller screens with margin set as auto for margin-left and margin-right to keep the page centered
store this in symbolic address p ask the user for a 21-character string s with the 21st chars always being null interpret p as a byte address and store s starting at p even if s has less than 21 chars store the chars sequentially still starting at byte address p what i don t understand is we are using .data which starts with 0x10010000 and we have to use the int p as a byte address so the possible addresses for p is 0x00000000 + int
table.aspx page have a table and a button that will open columns.aspx page which contains checkboxlist that should be used to hide and show columns of the table from table.aspx page
you can use toggle with a boolean flag but sometimes it s clearer to be explicit so show hide what you want giving

enabling profiling does more profiling of your code but if your only goal is to get sql queries installing extension is all you need assuming instrumentation key is set correctly
regarding your issues you are installing cpu only and old mac version of tensorflow which shouldn t work on windows. you could try using the following command python3 -m pip install but i suggest you use anaconda for the windows to install tensorflow and keras it has much less errors on windows you can find a guide for it here
i would rather prefer carthage than cocoapods
at this point choose the one you prefer between carthage or cocoapods
so to get names from this you need to either have x be chars it isn t it s int or have the return value of expr have names
they both must have a value and also the min can t be higher than the max
i need to ensure that the field max rent is always great than min rent and to proivded a message letting the user know
i recently learned the hard-way that on linux calloc is not nearly as fast as malloc this may have been exacerbated by the program rarely using anything more than the first 0.1 of memory allocated
you are trying to reach an index after the last index you need to change your loops condition to and you can solve this problem using for-loop which is more used for such problems you just need to substitute your while-loop with using this you wouldn t need to use substr method neither string letter
in both firefox and google-chrome indexeddb is slower than localstorage for basic key-value insertions and it still blocks the dom
what looks more appropriate in you case is to use rowdetailstemplate to define a child datagrid gridview to display the strings collection displaying the strings collection at the same level as the other properties could be a hard task to do and doesn t make much sense . here a sample of how to define a datagrid within another one same thing using gridview listview datagrid looks more appropriate
since you are applying it to chars which get promoted to int ascii value for that chars in java
notes most likely newer openssl-fips versions will also have sha1 disabled since it s considered weak so the invariant should be switched to one of the sha2 hash functions family sha256 or even better sha3 older openssl versions might not have it from my pov this is a little too restrictive as there might be cases when a hashing algorithm is needed for purposes that don t care about security and more complex and also time consuming allowed algorithms still have to be used since openssl_fips env var is handled at openssl executable level which will be bypassed as libcrypto will be used directly it s no use for the current situation so we have to go deeper
integer arithmetic if you look at you multiplication factors you can see that they can be represented by fractions 0.75 3 4 0.3125 5 16 this mean you can simply use integer arithmetic to perform the scaling
here is a figure i tried to draw as a better explanation here is the function i have coded to do that then from a cube object attached to the camera not to the scene it can be rendered like that as a result this is what i got with a perspective camera and now it works with microsoft edge safari and other browsers despite when attaching to the scene and updating the position of the object to keep it in front of the camera it was only workable with firefox and google-chrome as for today
now the width of the map is less than its height and it fits half of my monitor
how can i get the same result but per rolling time period which can not be less than 1 min so the expected result which price was traded with the max volume for the last 10 minutes is price volume 02 10 00 am 12549.5 95 the sample data datetime tradeprice tradevolume 1min time_of_day_10 time_of_day_30 date hour minute 0 2017-09-19 02 00 04 12559 93 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 49 2017-09-19 02 00 11 12562 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 50 2017-09-19 02 00 12 12563 2 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 51 2017-09-19 02 00 12 12562 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 122 2017-09-19 02 00 34 12561.5 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 123 2017-09-19 02 00 34 12562 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 127 2017-09-19 02 00 34 12562 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 129 2017-09-19 02 00 35 12561 2 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 130 2017-09-19 02 00 35 12560.5 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 131 2017-09-19 02 00 35 12561.5 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 135 2017-09-19 02 00 39 12562 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 136 2017-09-19 02 00 39 12562 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 137 2017-09-19 02 00 43 12561.5 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 138 2017-09-19 02 00 43 12561 2 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 139 2017-09-19 02 00 43 12560.5 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 140 2017-09-19 02 00 43 12560.5 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 152 2017-09-19 02 00 45 12562 2 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 153 2017-09-19 02 00 46 12562.5 4 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 166 2017-09-19 02 00 58 12562 1 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 167 2017-09-19 02 00 58 12562.5 2 2017-09-19 02 00 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 0 168 2017-09-19 02 01 00 12562 7 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 169 2017-09-19 02 01 00 12562.5 1 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 170 2017-09-19 02 01 00 12562.5 1 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 171 2017-09-19 02 01 00 12561.5 2 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 175 2017-09-19 02 01 03 12561 1 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 176 2017-09-19 02 01 03 12561 3 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 187 2017-09-19 02 01 07 12560.5 2 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 188 2017-09-19 02 01 08 12561 1 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 189 2017-09-19 02 01 10 12560 1 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 190 2017-09-19 02 01 10 12560 1 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 191 2017-09-19 02 01 10 12559.5 1 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 192 2017-09-19 02 01 11 12560 1 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 193 2017-09-19 02 01 12 12560 2 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 194 2017-09-19 02 01 12 12560.5 3 2017-09-19 02 01 00 02 00 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 1 593 2017-09-19 02 10 00 12550 1 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 594 2017-09-19 02 10 00 12549.5 12 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 604 2017-09-19 02 10 12 12548.5 1 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 605 2017-09-19 02 10 15 12549.5 22 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 606 2017-09-19 02 10 16 12549.5 21 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 636 2017-09-19 02 10 45 12548 1 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 637 2017-09-19 02 10 47 12548 2 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 638 2017-09-19 02 10 47 12549.5 23 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 639 2017-09-19 02 10 48 12549.5 17 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 640 2017-09-19 02 10 49 12549 1 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 665 2017-09-19 02 10 58 12550 1 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 666 2017-09-19 02 10 58 12550 1 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10 667 2017-09-19 02 10 58 12550 3 2017-09-19 02 10 00 02 10 00 02 00 00 2017-09-19 2 10
however when i set the width and height of the rectangle even though they re both set to the same length let s say 100x100 for the sake of it the height is clearly much longer than the width as if i ve set it to 100x140
but as i know you can type in value that greater than max or lower than min so better to manage it on server with updatenumericinput and back values in min max range in code
i want to convert given entity-relationship diagram with min max notation to tables and im unsure of what the primary key of the trainieren -relation is
this means that chars and int will be considered separately and chars will not be placed in int space even if int is of bit field type and free space is available
for other browser that i ve tested opera dophin firefox i just stares at my redirect_uri and refused to go back to the apps note i already prompted user to click link for the redirection i would like it to work more than only google-chrome and samsung browser if it can works with maybe firefox custom tab and more it will be great
i have created a method that draws an octagon and it works well as long as the size is 200 or higher well my problem is that if the size is less than 200 or if width is different from height and vice versa the figure is deformed. my goal is to create a self-adapting figure that retains its shape when the width and height is less than 200 or that width is different from height this is what happens if for example i set the size to 50x50
and condition nested for-loop you can use nested for loops as which would print list 30 intersect built-in function you can use intersect function which will give you common values in both lists as println list1.intersect list2 which should give you list 30

the output i am trying to get is when i input 1 + 1 i need to get the output of 2 and i want to implement the mdas rule which the multiplication and division has higher precedence over addition and subtraction
the image will now be centered its height is set by the cell s height and its width will be set by the aspect constraint
require rubygems require bundler bundler.require require . my_sinatra_app run mysinatraapp start your development server with rackup and sinatra will be loaded via bundler
it seems like if sockets are disconnected by the server after one minute of inactivity that would apply to ie and edge just as much as google-chrome and firefox
in fact trident and edgehtml are even more different than webkit and blink
aspect ratio is as simple as height divided by width let h 600 and w 800 then ar aspect ratio 600 800. for the image resize by specifying three parameters please reference to the image above
if you go the other way around and declare your desired method signature in swift you ll see the compiler complains it can t be represented in objective-c
which outputs the following user admin time 1521639136 ip_addy 127.0.0.1 browser firefox browser_version 59.0 os windows notice that the previous google-chrome entry is no longer in the file as it removes the previous entry and writes a new one my intended output is to display it like the following it does not have to be formatted with space it can simply be in one line and break line for the next input current problem when data is save to the file and it needs to be updated the file then gets overwritten with the new data and old data is disgarded
the value of x is only known when that op is evaluated so the condition needs to be evaluated by tensorflow or keras
so the function should look like this and then in main also see do not cast malloc and error messages should be printed to stderr not stdout
i think i know why namedtuple s access is slower than dictionary access
i have no blank area on my page there would be a blank area if setorientation wasn t called but the page remains portrait when printed its width being less than its height
set a x01 since the string is enclosed in double quotes the value is escaped as a binary string whose length 1 bytes is less than 44 and cannot be converted to int
wondering if it is possible within node to require context for a folder which is higher in the folder structure would it be possible to get to the parent2 dir from child 1 see file structure below with code like require.context .. parent2 true for a structure like root -parent1 --child1 -parent2
using giter8 directly is much faster because sbt new takes time to start it loads global sbt plugins every time
as can be seen plyr ldply returns a named list while purrr map doesn t
if the user can specify several registers in one command invocation then binary is more reasonable though not necessarily wholly reasonable but do consider the merits of hex over binary one hex digit controls the value of four bits
if the image width is larger than 200px the height will reduce to the same ratio if the original height width is 320 480 the new size will be 200 300 which is a 1.6 ratio
i want to get set width and height and also get set the window location
the actual code i chose objective-c for swizzling convenience but this could also be done in swift
there are many python frameworks that can make this task easier such as django bottle and flask
have the uicollectionview s cellforitemat method iterate over the data source and unhide the seats that have been filled solution 2 make sure that the uistackview in the custom class can be referenced from uicollectionview s cellforitemat method from cellforitemat use addarrangedsubview to add all the needed seats solution 3 register 5 different classes zero seats to four seats dequeue each one as dictated by the data source this one seems to me like the least dignified but might be the one with least performance penalty i m perfectly aware that there could be more and better solutions
this values can be transformed in binary values print format value1 016b # 1000000100100011 print format value2 016b # 0010010010001111 each one of these bit can be indexed from 0 to 15 from right to left and then we can split them as described in the documentation value1 d3-d0 0011 value1 d7-d4 0010 value1 d8 1 value1 d15 1 for each subset of bit the documentation provides us a number in hex value and each number in hex value can be converted in binary d3-d0 00h bin 0000 normal 01h bin 0001 overvolt 02h bin 0010 undervolt 03h bin 0011 low volt disconnect 04h bin 0100 overtemp and same for other sets.
in my portrait view my preview is shrinking but i got the full-size image for example when i take the image from landscape view i am getting the image of size 1080 960 where 1080 is width and 960 is height as well when i clicked the image from portrait view height of image is 1080 and width is 960 but i want image as same as landscape mode below is my surface code
if the above codes work correctly you will have graph folder in your working directory
short answer in java any parameters to an addition + with data types shorter than int byte short and chars are converted to integer. considering x x+1 first x gets cast to an int then the 1 also an int is added and the result of int + int is obviously also int
results i groupby applied the following function my question is how can i get the same solution but per rolling time period which can not be less than 1 min so the expected result which price was traded with the max volume for the last 10 minutes is price volume 02 10 00 am 12549.5 95 thanks in advance
the third approach allows to provide a nuget package with mixed-mode assemblies that can be referenced from anycpu assemblies
my company entity looks like this and my entities are all defined in this way the delete function does the following merge the company to be deleted get the lists find each element in the list in a for-loop entitymanager.find and removes it i ve tried merge too doesn t work set each of the lists to null don t know if it is necessary but it was mentioned in some post remove the company entity thanks in advance
i have managed to create a dataframe from entered variables write a custom function that runs linear regression models but can t seem to figure out how to use rlang to get entered variables into the list elements that will be entered into purrr pmap
you define the bufferedimage to be sized as width by height but then use full_width and full_height to fill it...it seems to me to make more sense to do it the other way round okay important lesson in swing you don t control the paint process so don t try
commit must be called after execute the prepare statement
i just used retrofit without okhttp. here is my code i aslo added okhttp3 by researching the error.here is the part that deals with okhttp3 but i got the same error.i think there is no need to add okhttp3 for the error because previusly i worked with retrofit without using okhttp then it worked as expected. here is the log output
it believe it should be related to box-sizing border-box but i cannot understand why the child elements behave in such a strange way given the fact that it should correctly have 198px height and leave no empty space after it
the y and y chars can t be converted to int s hence the exception
when we have a predefined js function we call it during an event for e.g onclick from html we use the parameter parentheses because above myfunction is loosely coupled with any html element above myfunction can be called by multiple html elements above myfunction can be called on different events onclick onchange etc. while when we call it from js we use the function name without parentheses because above myfunction is tightly coupled with any html element with id button above myfunction can only be called by html element with id button above myfunction can only be called by onclick event and no other
int types narrower than int are converted to int and float values to double
nginx apache both are nginx is faster response than apache nginx have different rewrite rule with laravel nginx is good choice nginx have fastcgi so you can use same like apache here is 1 understanding link sorry for my bad english hope this help you

here s how it should be prototyped int match chars s1 chars s2
3.spannablestringbuilder works in a little complex manner.we can append text to a spannablestringbuilder with one of the append methods.some part of the text a spannablestringbuilder holds can be marked as spanned and only that part gets styled with color font etc. when a new text is appended within a spannablestringbuilder object at any index if the new text will also be marked as spaned or not that is defined by the fields of the spanned interface. we call the setspan object what int start int end int flags method declared by the spannable interface and implemented by the spannablestringbuilder class. here what is a object of a class of the android.text.style.stylespan package this object defines the type of the styling we want to apply flags is one of the field defined in the spanned interface this flags parameter specifies when a new text is appended within this spannablestringbuilder object at any index if the new text will also be marked as spanned or not
append charsequence text appends given string to the end insert int where charsequence tb inserts the given string after the chars whose index is where-1 the new text inserted to this spannablestringbuilder will be marked as spanned and styled or not will depend on the flag we have specified to the previous call to the setspan object what int start int end int flags method
in case you don t know the exact height or width there s a less clean version involving setting the popup margin to auto and it s parent to display flex
the custom.css works very well for adjusting the width of a jupyter notebook and the font size while we are at it.. the cell height is trickier however since we do not want all cells to be made overly tall
for example the code above shows the first children div tag has a height of 1px more than parent
here is the best volley example i prefer always that gives you a better control with get and post method using volley
the basichttpbinding with transport mode can be used with https but the actual problem is his ssl is a self-signed certificate
i would like to have it so that if i select more than one checkbox then the entire column of the action button given a class of .table-btn disabled
something like this i tried using inline-flex for rows but seems like parent becomes smaller than the total width of children
for that you need to get deeper than ratchet - to reactphp and its eventloop
to ensure this the compiler uses the following rules if an operand is an int that is narrower than an int it undergoes integral promotion as described above to int or unsigned int. if the operands still do not match then the compiler finds the highest priority operand and implicitly converts the other operand to match. the priority of operands is as follows long double highest double float unsigned long long long long unsigned long long unsigned int int lowest in your case on of operands has type int and another one type size_t so max was promoted to type size_t and bit representation of -1 is the biggest possible size_t
in the expression the value returned by strlen will be promoted to unsigned int and will be compared with the maximum value of the unsigned integer
you need double-quotes where parameters should be expanded not single-quotes
i would ve expected the branch to merge with master after squash intermediate commits in the squash and merge operation as well
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
i m not familiar with mysql spatial i use postgresql with postgis
it seems like if sockets are disconnected by the server after one minute of inactivity that would apply to ie and edge just as much as google-chrome and firefox
no matter it trigger by mousemove or mousedown
even worse - after the realloc whatever value the x used to be isn t a valid pointer anymore because realloc free that old memory
so i have to manually select configurations fron jboss to be migrated to wildfly
if it doesn t maybe the image should be squared same width and height
when an item is inserted into a hashset gethashcode is called and the item needs to be compared using equals to any other objects in the set that have the same int hashcode
union all is more efficient as union will take unnecessary distinct
did not work for me on macos sample code for web nfc api service device_information this worked in google-chrome but requires experimental features to be enabled on safari and firefox for checking browser support at the time of writing this i could not find any other way of implementing bluetooth and nfc in websites
it can also be done with dictionary zip map and repeat from itertools
documentation also out of curiosity is a foreach loops more optimized than a for-loop in terms of speed
so if you have a int and a double the double is higher precision so the result will have that form
provided that equality is required for entities entity-objects can be considered equals if they map the same entity id est they refer to the same entity key the example shown by tucaz just mention an id see the over-implemented gethashcode not to mention the buggy equals i can guess that one straightforward implementation could be that s all
saves the hassle of modifying the original file that might get changed during upgrade or service pack installation
this can be done using scapy instead of pyshark
if the rotationx or rotationy properties are changed and this view is large more than half the size of the screen it is recommended to always use a camera distance that s greater than the height x axis rotation or the width y axis rotation of this view
however c++ standard s only and just the same in c... requirement for unsigned char is being able to minimally hold the values from 0 to 255 and actually not having larger size than unsigned short
the x linear interpolation can be done without multiplication nor division if you rewrite it to integer dda style .
now it s time to decide if the camera stored the image as portrait width is smaller than height or as landscape in which case it s your duty to rotate it for display
i want them to get animated on show and on hide and trigger various stuff on the recyclerview items when pushed
ntlm is less secure and negotiate lets the client and server use kerberos if both of them support it - if not they fallback to ntlm
1 can be treated as int or as double float
in case file column from op dataframe got fixed number of items say 4 for each row which are separated by _ then one efficient solution can be found using tidyr separate library tidyverse the above statement will divide file data in 4 columns with name part1 part2 part3 part4
a short example would be note since strtok modifies the original string and advances the pointer it uses you must make a copy of the friends token and preserve a pointer to the starting address of the allocated token for friends pf so that it can be free after you are done with separating friends also note if your system provides strdup you can replace the two calloc strlen p + 1 1 and strcpy pf p
innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb. index y_id x_id -- the primary key makes it efficient to go one direction
i want to work primarily on metal-level but i need pbr for some of my objects. i thought there should be nothing that can be done in scenekit which is based on metal which can t be done in metal itself

in practice this warning can show for cases like if using ui form editor and you manually drag a widget such that resulting geometry can t fit in screen at run time or more generally when a widget geometry is smaller than the layout contents it isn t a serious issue because the widget will automatically adjust and render correctly but this issue can be solved by insuring the widget gets enough space before rendered this is done by adjusting its size to contents thus try on the other hand while the issue is not reproducible to me with but it only appeared at 200 200 100 100 it could be your geometry width height is smaller than your chart view dimensions try to adjust them to higher geometry width height to accommodate your chart
fixed width of 600px fixed height of 600px the following code will resize image proportionally and not let the image be greater than height and width specified
so far i have this home.html.erb post controller i get the general idea from looking at other answers but i still get an undefined method each for nil nilclass error even though i have more than one post in the database

since there is already plentiful of theory of how and why the loops work in the way they do i would like to offer some empirical by some definition authoritative measurements conclusions foreach loops is faster than for-loop
so i think that you should really retain that parent is much more structuring as dependencies as it defines both more things for the children projects but it also allow not to repeat the actual configuration that you want to define in a set of projects
this is my project url hosted this is what google-chrome shows me enter image description here and this is what opera shows enter image description here thanks
so fieldname would typically be a boolean column such as in if it is not a boolean column then mysql will try to convert a number will first get truncated to int

i also expected that the else statement in int main would handle any inputs that didn t match the expected r b g o or x . it works for single chars but if more than one chars is entered it goes all screwy scrolling continuously and not stopping for input
however the found that the behavior is not completely consistent with google-chrome firefox and edge either
just some minor modifications to clean up your code can simply become and within your for-loop there is no need to check the complete range of i only its upper bound can become this will have the same result as your if-statement but is more elegant since i will never be less than 0
if the viewport height ever gets bigger than the width on any mobile or a resized window you ll get horizontal scrollbars or hidden overflowing content
explaining floating-point rounding issues is a big enough job that it takes up a whole paper that s so important that it s been included by reference in multiple language specifications but the short version is that sqrt could very easily give you a number that s a tiny big bigger or smaller than an integer so is_integer will give you the wrong answer
the moment you add another p callable attribute a new method say to be found on self super .p and self.p will produce different outcomes
this can be done by grouping by the column or columns to look for duplicates in and then aggregate and filtering the results
the code is originated from a component but i adjusted it to run in jsfiddle the quantity value is the issue. it is initialized with 0 and when i just press the buy button the console shows but as soon as i change the value by either using the spinners or just type in a new value the console will show tested with firefox 59.0.2 and google-chrome 65.0.3325.181
what unorganized point cloud means is that the points are not assigned to a fixed organized grid therefore can t be used height is always 1 and the width is just the size of the cloud

loop through the array and compare each element to see if its greater than max or less than min
is it because a compiled python code under debian is not compatible with ubuntu or am i doing a personal mistake like missing library etc.
checking if there s another non-whitespace chars is a more robust approach the common size for int these days is 32 bits which can handle numbers up to a couple billion when signed or a bit over 4 billion for unsigned int
on android it uses audiotrack i confirmed it to be faster than soundpool and no meaningful difference from c++ side opnesl es of ndk
so in your case the insert statement should look like this further reading mysql docs and example similar article for postgresql contains a better explanation of potential problems
of 7 runs 10 loops each jacquot solutions sees to be 10x faster than grouping then filtering
structure grandparent parent child child child child float in the middle flex preferred as you have more alignment options especially if your children are smaller than parent available space and you want them to evenly distribute
after the image has been written to ram memory it can be transferred to disk for long term storage
major upgrade are based on upgradecode so your application just needs to do a web service call somewhere passing the current productversion and upgradecode and then you need to download any versioning that is higher than your current productversion then install it
and so it is indeed the case that the o n 3 time of floyd-warshall is not better than the o n n + e lgn time of making n calls to dijkstra
in order to do this you must have retained the min and max values of the original data
if you know for sure that src and dst don t overlap call memcpy as it won t matter which one you call for the result both will work correctly in that case but memmove will never be faster than memcpy and if you are unlucky it may even be slower so you can only win calling memcpy
only after each piece of data has completed loading can the application be considered ready
impala can query hbase but it is not similar in architecture and in my experience a well designed hbase table is faster to query than impala
when all come before the first then you can simply extract the two sub-vectors reverse the second and combine them alternatively you could use if you are actually looking for a general solution with more than one loops you can combine a stack with a for-loop
you 99 percentile is showing average time from the start of the test reducing lowest value 2.5 + 0.5 - remove lowest 0.5 and returns 2.5 2.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 - remove lowest 0.5 and returns 3 2 - 1.5 2.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 - remove lowest 0.5 and return 3.5 3 - 1 as you can see 99 percentile is correct and have higher value than max which have a peak at start

with lmfit.model much of the work you do in your objective function is done for you and your script would become to add weights to a model fit you can define an array of weights to be used to multiplying data-model and pass that to model.fit
but as soon i want to tokenize the text with following code i get a messed up output output i tried already to decode it and i tried to put this in the skript import sys reload sys sys.setdefaultencoding utf-8 but i still get the same output i would like to get this output in case someone can help me here is a sample df
btw in opera it is even worse - opera not only duplicates request but sends it many more times google-chrome is nice with sending it only once
you want just this instead securitycodesended.addrange securitycodepresend.take 15 and now for some pedantry i note that your code should conform to the c# .net naming conventions method parameters and in this case local variables should be camelcase public and protected instance members should be pascalcase static fields should in my opinion be prefixed with an underscore _ instance members should always be prefixed with this
the main file to maintain in this case would be the build.gradle file since the yaml file will be maintained by gradlew
i have three field in my html one is mobile_min mobile_max and third field i have taken is test which is a input field.so what i have to do i have to create a custom validation with custom message in which my requirement is mobile_min value should not be greater than mobile_max value after submitting the from.so my code is working fine but i am getting this message the min value is not greater than max value field is required. and but i want this message the min value is not greater than max value field. .i have also read the custom message rule of ci but it is not working
what i found is this library have swift version however range selection version is only available with objective-c
the output will also be stored in directory so again you need to go to the root folder of the hierarchy and run the class as java foo.bar.yourclass you might also consult the packages trail of the java tutorial
i m all good up until the decoder function needs to compare words with punctuation in them
i know the imageview is not empty after picasso loads it because i can display the image
tensorflow is a lot more generic than keras and allows arbitrary graph architectures so showing such a structured summary does not make sense for arbitrary tensorflow graphs
the best way to convert that string 4 to 4 is to use strtol with examples here but atoi is slightly easier as an example that does semantically what your code does but is safer and compiles note the #define this is a preprocessor macro that helps keep the 60 common between the buffer size and the length passed to fgets
i ve already removed setinterval as it was worse than recursive settimeout
if you look at the output from the resources macro your can see that the routes are ordered to take this into consideration prefix verb uri pattern controller#action things get things . format things#index post things . format things#create new_thing get things new . format things#new edit_thing get things id edit . format things#edit thing get things id . format things#show patch things id . format things#update put things id . format things#update delete things id . format things#destroy the get things new route must be declared before get things id
the image being downloaded is bigger than the width height of the screen and i ve set
i need to show different message for value less than min and more than max
this solution is also setup to be used as lodash underscore.js mixin and extends loadash underscore.js capabilities
the screen height is smaller than its width and remember this is not landscape mode
i want the normal devices to use layout and the devices which has height smaller than the width use another layout
update if you are willing to set different layout based on the decision that the height is less than the width then you might just consider checking the screen height and width before setting the content view of the activity
if the date range is more than 31 day s i need to restrict the enddate to max of 31 days
but this comes with an problem when there are more than two children under one cell there will be duplicate parent cell
that s 3 queries to get one post which quickly takes its toll when returning more than 10 post
i m only going to post the algorithm the code should be fairly simple after createfile call getfinalpathnamebyhandle on the handle and save it in a variable in the loop that constantly calls readdirectorychangesw at each iteration wait_timeout call getfinalpathnamebyhandle again on the handle and compare the result with the saved value
your entire first loop can be rewritten as there s no need to call malloc and strcpy so many times - and that pair can be replaced with strdup - that s both posix-standard and supported on windows so it s pretty widely available
i have used elementtree as preferred although i would have used lxml myself
i would run a while loops with a for-loop inside that iterates at a match and stores in an arrays that gets bigger using redim preserve
i was hoping that if i can get answer to point 1 may be i can put some check on number of digits and do something
here is what i came up with this is how the downloaded foobar.xml file looks then testet with google-chrome version 65.0.3325.181 firefox 59.0.1 and microsoft edge 41.16299.371.0
you container is set with display flex and .hero-image is a flex item and it s width is no more 100 like a default div but it s equal to size of its content and that s why margin auto is centering your element where you don t need to specify a fixed width
the angle of the circular shape can simply be adjusted with height and width the bad as the other parts of the border are still there transparent you need to adjust the size of the parent element according to the shape and set overflow hidden
when you use + to sum a chars with and int the result will be promoted to int
you may find that ggplot2 then becomes overkill and slow for your application lattice is typically faster and so is base plot
if you use a video from sites like youtube and vimeo it s better if you load the source of those url into your page through an iframe so that it will automatically adjust what it thinks is best for the user like pre-loads the video when paused.
this data can now be plotted with matplotlib or seaborn if you like. pandas itself has also some plotting methods already included
i m wondering would a throw new error cause node to write the error to stderr or a unknown rangeerror or do those just get written to stdout
for the first time i entered application there is no problem about showing charts but when i pinch zoom into line chart view i am getting following error in the axisrendererbase class. fatal error double value cannot be converted to int because it is either infinite or nan
i determined that 1 row is causing my int to be bumped to chars
angular 4 is just an imrovement over previous one like adding if then else as in for-loop addition of titlecase in pipe filters typescript versioning upgrade which is faster etc. for further reference well google best suggest to use angular cli to work on angular its used as same in prevoius versioning but there are other ways also to work on it apart from cli
in this case pkcs#7 padding should be supported and the input types should be specified binary character string hex base64 . it also seems to require bytes in cipher.encrypt b attack at dawn notice the b
in this case pkcs#7 padding should be supported and the input types should be specified binary character string hex base64 etc
if it wasn t the cursor for-loop you d first declare a cursor and then a cursor variable open the cursor fetch take care when to exit loops close the cursor such as as you can see cursor for-loop is easier to write and maintain because oracle does a lot of tasks for you
unlike async_read there is no other work to be done by post so providing just boost asio use_future doesn t makes sense but we could define an async_result trait to get the same behavior for post
int 41 for the color red must be split into chars 4 and chars 1
null 0 is java.lang.integer and it becomes similar to you should note that null can be boxed as int float double etc
it comes with some serializable logic added via annotations to specify what should be ignored during serializable and what order should be applied during serializable and deserialization i want to change these annotations without having to creating my own class with all the other logic copied over
from the book note that shadowing a named does not alter or destroy the value it was bound to and the value will continue to exist until it goes out of scope even if it is no longer accessible by any means the previous value is not more accessible after shadowing and it will be destroyed at the end of the scope not when the variable is shadowed
this means that at phong shading the light calcualtions ar done in the fragment shader not to be confused with phong reflection model
you need to set your variables to not i also recommend using post instead of get just for security
dr variables that are created inside a for-loop will be needed outside loops but references get lost and cause memory leaks
i am trying to find the author and last modified by details of every file in a directory and i am using vbscript to loop through since i think that that would be quicker than using vba
this is a little bit tricky and you can mainly utilize the dplyr package to do the manipulation and lubridate packages to convert the date format you can use as.date for sure but lubridate makes it easier
i have an imageview and a textview and i need dynamic cell size for both depending if the textview has more text inside of it
more info here also you are using a very old firebase versioning it is better to upgrade to the latest versioning to be able to use the new features
interestingly on google-chrome the difference is much greater than on firefox as i just tried out
you must use an annotation if the marker applies to any program element other than a class or interface as only classes and interfaces can be made to implements or extends an interface
assuming that the shape of a post object is more or less the same between those two rest endpoints you could reasonably get away with making the assumption that the content from api post 13 would be included in the content from api blogs page 1
am trying to support different languages with socket-io and from what i understand using headers is out of the question so am left with the query parameter . a user can switch language not on first connection only but multiple times on the client-side by adding a query value on every emitted message that will be caught on server-side
for mp4 generation video frames will be encoded in h.264 by default in this code the gop is 12
you can do so using while loops edit can be done using for-loop too

for each primes if you multiplying it by the other primes in a descending order the first palindrome you find will be the highest possible for that primes so its not necessary to iterate the rest if the multiplication is lower than highest palindrome found checking if it is palindrome is not necessary not sure how many of these tips you can apply to your code in a functional way but here is a javascript non functional approach that makes full use of these ideas and takes less than 1 second additional tip it could be further optimized by calculating with binary search the first prime2 that will cause prime1 to have 9 digits instead of 10 that way skipping a lot of iterations over primes2
in terms of its virtual address the memory will be part of the heap s area of the memory but it will be separate from the heap in the sense that it won t be managed by malloc and free

as it is stated with the polling methode cpu must work non-stop which is really dumb because instead of working continously for an internal peripheral it could just easily do some other job like waiting for tcp reception or something that can t be done via irq or simply go to low-power mode and wait for the irq to kick in

-i m only importing kivy in the the main.py therefore i don t think that adding anything in the libraries to be imported by buildozer has anything to do with the problem
reason - you are counting arrays length inside loops and every time when any value got unset from the arrays length of arrays decreased and value of changed simply decreased so logically your 5th and 6th element never goes through if condition they never get traversed by loops because of decreasing length of the arrays solution 1 - put count outside and it will work properly - output - solution 2 - that s why i prefer foreach over for-loop output -
i think after i will have ascribed a max value a min value and all the values over 100 summed together
i thought that ssl handshake errors are mostly server issue with https certificate or its infrastructure
note that string comparisons need to be done using strcmp but you can t use strcmp directly with qsort when you re sorting an array of pointers because the argument types are wrong
otherwise payload that you send with fetch will only be the very last object created in the for-loop get rid of the wrapping the values for each property in the object your loops iteration must be less than arrays length not since length is a count that starts at 1 but arrays indexing starts at zero

there are several ways to do that. we find that 3 is the only primes that divides more than one modulus and the highest power of that primes that divides more than one modulus is i use the notation for exponentiation used in python and fortran for clarity since the caret also has other uses in computers. that could prevent your system of equations from having any solution at all
if a higher power of 3 also divided more than one modulus we would need to check those higher powers as well. for each primes that we discovered and each modulus we find the highest power of that primes that divides the modulus
we also add the new equations we get for each power of the primes that divides more than one modulus
at least in this case the order by...limit may be more efficient than min max even when an index can be used
my print line is in c++ if you want to print something you can simply std cout it given the things that you want to print have overloaded for ostream -- no need to construct a string object first and since getstatus returns a status you should make sure the status class has overloaded for the ostream

floating-point arithmetic is often more expensive than integer arithmetic in terms of processor cycles and or the space required for it in the silicon of processors and or the energy required for it
since loops index is more or less useless we can use the enhanced for-loop construct to loops over the words in the arrays if you have not learned the enhanced for-loop you can stick with but understand you will not use the value i at any other point inside loops
more resources on the retired legacy directx sdk directx sdk tools catalog directx sdk samples catalog directx sdks of a certain age and the zombie directx sdk more resources for learning direct3d11 getting started with direct3d 11 and directx tool kit for dx11 note you should also consider moving to vs 2017 instead of sticking with a 12+ year old toolset
but an ascending index can help to quickly partition the set of records into those records that have a lower value than the minimum of the range and those that have a higher value than it
that is the number of due dates that are greater than the range s maximum is far smaller than the number of them being less than its minimum
in other words taking the partition of those invoices with a due date greater than the minimum of the range which we can get quickly from the index and filtering out the few where the due date is greater than the maximum isn t a too bad approach

so all of these are valid binary max heaps of 4 items 4 4 4 2 3 3 2 3 1 1 1 2 the key here is that in each case the largest value is at the root and children are always smaller than their parent
polyfills is a more specialized type of shim that is used to provide forward compatibility in different browser level specifications
although loading the entire arrays may seem wasteful it is much faster than parsing the file line-by-line provided you have enough memory to do so. it turns out -- thanks to hpaulj for motivating me to test -- that a simple for-loop is much faster for example with this setup we can use ipython to benchmark the speed of using_genfromtxt vs using_readline so a simple for-loop is actually 10x faster

going back to the initalization though this is how you would set every element in a stack-allocated array on declaration if you dynamically allocate the array i recommend using calloc or memset to set the array elements to a default value for the same reason
to.daily can only be applied to xts zoo objects and can only convert to a lower frequency
note that the fact that your compareto is not consistent with equals may create other issues so only do this if you understand what you are doing
to allow connections from your lan you need to edit the following edit my.conf and find the bind-address parameter in the mysqld section this will probably be set to localhost or 127.0.0.1 you can either change this to the ip of the machine you want to connect to the database or use a wildcard and allow your whole local range e.g 192.168.0
we have several azure search indexes that use a cosmos db collection of 25k documents as a source and each index has a large number of document properties that can be used for sorting and filtering
the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself
if i use only the minimum number of elements will be validated max has no effect
actually this can be done by ng-show or ng-if or ng-switch but if you want a clean html template view and your arrays structures are the same you may want to migrate the logic to controller like and do the logic of using which array in your controller
i think nginx is much better than apache
when one says that hashmap get put is o 1 it should really say that the time needed for the get put is more or less constant and does not depend on the number of elements in the hashmap so far as the hashmap can be presented on the actual computing system
it looks like you might have thought that fgetc tested to see if there was another byte available and that fread then read it
so most likely you ll need to set the width with 2px lower than the height
im new to setting up apache - the site works fine on localhost but when i access it from the lan it does now display the index.html file - instead the browser says this site can t be reached localhost refused to connect
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0
and these city specification be combined together using previously defined logical specifications so our combined specificaton would look like this following that filtering would be easy we just need to pass the specification a parameter criterion object from original question could be expressed as a specification yet we are flexible to adjust business rules in any way we want here maxfemalepopulation and minfemalepopulation need to be defined often specification uses builder pattern that allows building of the specification using fluent interfaces sorting can be done after filtering because there will be less items to sort collections.sort filtering
html css if you need to fix the dimensions of the parent so that the element does not define the size of the window you could do something like so with your css in this case your width will ideally be 400px wide but never exceed the viewport width and never be more that 400px high but never exceed the viewport height. if you want to get even cleverer with your height you could use calc for you max height so the that window never exceeds a specific height taking into consideration other elements on the page
perhaps chrome used to call it quic rather than http 2 + quic but it would always have been using http 2 or its similar predecessor spdy
however this turns out not to be the case i ve tried many combinations of jruby jvm options but the steady state is 2x slower than mri
i have a nasty bug that i can t solve for quite some time. i have implemented maze solving using a a-star and dijkstra in python and my a is actually slower than dijkstra
your navbar component is the first one to be called the parent component so to speak building up before the children are initialized
i don t understand the following sequence where a virtual environment in my mac os ends up with a versioning of pip that s older than the versioning it created it we ve made sure the interpreter is 2.7.15 this is just a check that the interpreter is 2.7.15 and now we generate the requirements output which is small as expected but which gives this warning which is what i don t understand we ll now leave the environment and do freeze outside it no suggestion for upgrade is given here despite the fact that we have the same versioning of python if i understand correctly as we check next why did it install a different versioning of pip
if you re a student you can get free licence for maya 3dsmax and zbrush. maya 3dsmax and blender is more convenient for tech objects like robots cars etc. zbrush is more convenient for organic objects
permissions can be changed with chmod ownership can be changed with chown
first off this while loops should be made a for-loop like so this is simply because it is more stylistically appropriate
side note you could research the orm approach to models laravel and a host of other frameworks use it but codeigniter has a more whatever approach to just about everything
nano etc postgresql 9.x main pg_hba.conf change peer in this line local all postgres peer to local all postgres trust restart the server sudo service postgresql restart login into psql and set your passwd psql -u postgres alter user postgres with passwd your-pass
when an image is scaled it is done with respect to the top left so it will always look up if the height is smaller than the prefix or to the right if the width is smaller
keras is a higher level library that is much easier to learn than tensorflow and you have more sample code online
cpu is multicore user-space app will have affinity to one core
so instead of using double and allowing for invalid inputs you should be using long instead which has a greater range than int
it was simply just gain super user privilege and then enable and start rsync process sudo su enter your passwd then digit systemctl enable rsync systemctl start rsync if you don t have a systemctl based terminal just use service instead
the two are often useful for when you want to seperate those two ways of looking at a vector for example if you need to have an influcence between two bodies where the influence is inversly proportional to the distance between them you can do this is the most typical use case for me i am not sure what the author of the original code meant by his as it does seem he could just use a vector difference without using the two extra calls mathf.clamp returns value of value lies between min and max returns min if its lower and max if is greater
vsts is better than tfs because is 100 online
i have an image thats a particular height and width and its designed in such a way where its content is meant to be displayed at a minimum height and as the height increases more of the image is allowed to be seen meant to clip at the frame
i don t think this is really what you meant by using dplyr or that this is better than a do.call rbind lapply ... approach but you could define a function like you ve described above then use your piping to group_by region to apply the function to each group definitely would need a number check though it does seem to match your output for the 500 group at least
the site loads more post as i get to the bottom
as comment said this should be handled server-side but if you had no option other than to implement it client-side it s possible that said it s generally a good idea to use async or defer regardless so as to avoid blocking document parsing while the script is executing
you can use get post method or session cookie for passing data from one page to another page example get and post php code change the method for the form to post if you want to do it via post. both are equally insecure although get is easier to hack. get method can handle less amount of data. for handling higher amount of data use post methode and also check the post_max_size in php.ini file
just add jobtitledetailedlabel height constrain to be greaterthanorequaltoconstant profileimageview height + 10 for margin because if jobtitledetailedlabel height is less than image height it will make it small cell row
so the width will never cover the screen because it s smaller than height
i am trying to map a string of chars a t c g into a 64 bit int where each letter is represented as two bits using this mapping the sequence string will not be longer than 28 chars and i intend for the int to be zero-padded at the beginning to make it 64 bits
i think it should be used a delimiter for array of string such as a comma character beside that there is no trimming spaces for example entityarchivedevent
i have vtk files from a numerical simulation that i usually visualize with paraview
the type of your button is a submit so when you click on it is triggering the onsubmit event which is not existing in your case so you ll have to choose between submission your form or using a click event on a normal button below is a clear example on how the two approaches work approach 1 using a form submission approach 2 using a simple click event
it s worth noting that nvl is a binary function meaning only one column value can be tested however coalesce can test multiple columns values at the same time like below select coalesce column1 column2 column3 null from your_table
you want to compare min with max not and that condition have two part then the code would be from what i am seeing bainarysearch
sampling your layout using pure borderlayout and gridlayout and the fully resizable output the same can be achieved using gridbaglayout which is similar to miglayout in the way of thinking about the layout and positioning and spanning components over grid cells
if i d use the interface client-side only i could use a response proxy like this however i can t properly use this interface for the server-side implementation since responseobject is to be used client-side only with an interface for automatic mapping from generic http-responses not as a return type on the server side
now the mentioned misconception is caused by the fact that vast majority of tutorials together with stock visual studio code snippets instruct you to use clr properties for regular dependency properties and get set accessor for attached ones
i would think exists if you just want the entity attribute values with pairs use group by note that you could use but count distinct incurs more overhead than min and max
innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb. index y_id x_id -- the primary key makes it efficient to go one direction
from out of nowhere when the link should be processed i get an exception if i put a breakpoint and use debug mode however the first link is processed properly but i get the same error when the 2nd should be processed
from the server side on linux server you can set up the required header in web server configuration for source domain example.com in plesk go to and add the following directives in additional directives for http and additional directives for https alternatively in this case .htaccess file with the following content can be used if nginx is enabled and static content needed to be displayed use the following directive in additional nginx directives field without apache directives
you can just set up your edittext with font needed then call then you will get required width and height from bounds
i have read that express 4.x is not compatible with node.js native http2 from 8.4+ and i was hoping for more progess on express 5.x than it has. but as i started thinking that express5.x will probably be released to late for my next node.js project - i came over nest.js
but in honesty for rpc remote procedure calls people choose between get and post by either get for operations that don t modify anything and post for other cases
when a new task is added to a queue i want to run it if the number of ongoing tasks is less than max the reason i can t use atomicinteger or longaddr is that they only allow you to compare against a specific value instead of a range of values
you ended up in this loops because it was a bad idea in the first place to use a while loops to process the arguments should have used a for-loop for arg
since insertion-sort will break it s loops after making only n comparison and the other half will be sorted by mergesort in nlogn and you get upper-bound as nlogn
mail.domain.com-le-ssl.conf generated by let s encrypt my apache2 virtual host config for reverse proxy mail.example.com.conf please note that my original apache2 config file is because i don t really need ssl encryption between apache and nginx the rewrite rule was added when i installed let s encrypt certificate on apache mail server for mail.example.com
however when i apply a height it applies it more like a margin than actual height
example the data frame looks like i tried and it returns an error valueerror arrays were different lengths 2 vs 3 i wonder if there is any better solution than using for-loop to iterate the dataframe
if you want well to control the animation of the pixmap highly recommend qgraphicspixmapitem with qpropertyanimation
edited why it s the proper way from linked manual the query only needs to be parsed or prepare once but can be execute multiple times with the same or different parameters
the easiest way i found to import url links list from excel or txt text document to google-chrome is open firefox no this is not a joke highlight all the cells with url inside in excel click hold on the selected cells and move to bookmark zone from firefox and release the click firefox understand what he needs to do and makes bookmarks open google-chrome three dots on top left bookmarks import bookmarks import from firefox firefox devs made this better than google-chrome clap clap
i have a documents in elasticsearch with the following structure i want to write some queries that allow me to count the aggregated documents for variablepart. also i would like to make sure that the result of my queries can be viewed with kibana but i do not know where to start
non-final variables should almost always be used with getter and setter
if the number is already a string one could take advantage of the fact that a string can be treated as a chars array and chars can be converted to int implicitly this can handle arbitrarily large strings as long as the total doesn t exceed int.maxvalue eg unless the number is already in string form though this isn t efficient nor does it verify that the contents are an actual number
all of this bodged together as it might be works in google-chrome and firefox on the networks i am constrained to using but does not do a thing in internt explorer
if you want to send data of xml you can do this in both put and post it does not have to be determined content-length but you must add content-type
that s only possible with chunked transfer-encoding or with content-length
width and width multiplied by x should be classified as width key w height and height multiplied by x should be classified as height key h and so on
i m trying now to install memcached and mcrypt but with the homebrew change i understand this needs to be done through pear pecl
your textarea width is greater the the container 100 + 2px of border + 2px left padding + 2px right padding so used box-sizing border-box
maybe contrary to its name filewriter is also buffered though it has smaller buffer than bufferedwriter so contents are not written to disk immediately
in other words instead of throwing a runtimeexception your compiler converts the int that takes less size to the type that takes more size which is in your case a double
debian 9 stable at the moment uses and older version than ubuntu 18.04 stable at the moment and debian unstable
as such all you d need is a simple call to std max to determine the bigger value of two inputs when using the new size it will basically resize the window to match your object unless the object is smaller than your minimum size
i recommend adding protected setters to the parent class or make them public if you have external classes setting these values
as a rule of thumb you should use the prototype scope for all beans that are stateful while the singleton scope should be used for stateless beans
running different major version releases of kibana and elasticsearch kibana 5.x and elasticsearch 2.x is not supported nor is running a minor version of kibana that is newer than the version of elasticsearch kibana 5.1 and elasticsearch 5.0
however in order to facilitate an upgrade process where elasticsearch is upgrade first you can run a minor versioning of elasticsearch that is higher than kibana kibana 5.0 and elasticsearch 5.1
how can i use the logs generated by python code to be used by fluentd and publish it to elasticsearch
thus in your code you would use the functionality or role names you whish but behind the scenes everything would be translated in ad grouping membership. i have written an authorization filtering that handles latter scenario and i am happily sharing it with you if you need it - you have tagged your question with asp.net-mvc
your requirement can be achieved in tfs vsts easily
the conditional operator can only be used with scalar arithmetic or pointer operands
it s very easy to spend a lot of time making a reliable layer on top of udp that is both slower and less reliable than tcp
however mkl will be used whenever eigen falls back to blas lapack methods
access_token access_token maptiler tilehosting tiles in pbf format - zoom max 14 pbf format is basically same as mapbox mvt same parsers might be used to get tile just use link z x y .pbf
in the example above it always uses 17.5 width for the menu because if max is smaller than min then max is ignored and the function is treated as min. source what i want is a menu that is 17.5 width with a max of 250px
you can t use grid-template-columns because the minmax function computes to min anytime max is less than min
note using parsefloat ieee 754 double precision floating-point means you have a maximum of 52 bits of precision which is a bit more than 15 decimal places
it seems i should use post to pass the array but the user input could only be passed via get right
for the visualization i am using mayavi since it was easy to set up and does a better job than matplotlib in 3d
the video will be 100 height of the container and centered horizontally note i chose not to write a conditional to check if the video height is greater than the width because it seems like it d be a fringe case
as far as i can tell get requests are supposed to be safer not less safe than post requests because get only retrieves data while post sends data to the server
it should then notice that the min max difference is still greater than 0.2 and start all over again
below should be the first group of 11 from the above sample after the code is done 178 179 1.0 0.00277 170.3 82 83 1.0 0.00145 170.3 574 575 1.0 0.00162 170.3 97 98 1.0 0.00190 170.3 399 400 1.0 0.00172 170.4 21 22 1.0 0.00166 170.4 67 68 1.0 0.00176 170.5 103 104 1.0 0.00154 170.5 553 554 1.0 0.00169 170.5 533 534 1.0 0.00167 170.5 177 178 1.0 0.00160 170.5 and here is the result of my code as it currently stands group 0 was bad. 643 4 group 0 was bad. 642 4 group 0 was bad. 641 4 group 0 was bad. 640 4 group 0 was bad. 639 4 group 0 is good. 638 4 group 1 was bad. 638 4 group 0 is good. 637 4 group 1 was bad. 637 4 group 0 is good. 636 4 group 1 was bad. 636 4 group 0 is good. 635 4 group 1 was bad. 635 4 group 0 is good. 634 4 group 1 was bad. 634 4 group 0 is good. 633 4 group 1 is good. 633 4 634 4 635 4 636 4 637 4 638 4 639 4 group 1 is good. 639 4 640 4 group 1 is good. 640 4 641 4 group 1 is good. 641 4 642 4 group 1 is good. 642 4 643 4 group 1 is good. 643 4 643 4 notice how it keeps removing rows when it reads that group 0 has a difference between max and min that is greater than 0.2
the keyboard can be shown and hid over and over and nothing is ever fired
i also notice that the fields inside the no param constructor can be changed using getter and setter methods so i do not see differences with a constructor that has parameters
even if the element has a greater width than height or the other way around it will still become a circle and not an oval
you can create npm and yarn task wrappers and npm is not required to be installed gradlew and dependency management takes care of that node plugin documentation execute npm tasks so just gradlew --init in the reactjs project s root folder then add the plugin and npm tasks to your new build.gradle file
if you re trying to clone a regular git repo that happens to be hosted in tfs vsts you can just use regular git clone
notice that c is such a low-level language that coding conventions are really important in particular when you deal with pointers to heap allocated - malloc -ed or calloc -ed- data you should define and document some convention explaining who and how these pointers should be free -d and what is the size of the pointed data
parent will be sorted above children because their parentid is -1
the reason this happens is because the mouseleave the helper plane between two mousemove events
for it to be adapted to int double or similar
this is sort of a wild guess but i think the problem is here you just split the text which means that some stop words might still be glued to punctuation and thus are not filtered in the next step
here a a few issues to address the arrays do not need to have int type chars type is a more appropriate choice
while the third is doing something similar to the second but is saving that until runtime which is my guess as to why still a property call within a new inline method which i would have expected to get put out into its own compiler created method similar to the second version so i m guessing that part is going to happen at compile time which would explain why it s time is so ridiculously higher than the first two
sometimes calloc is more preferable call in c as it protects on some platforms against overflow and remember to free
you need to give fixed width and height to the table cells so that it won t be distorted on time of adding images
multiplying all odd positions indexes 1 3 5 etc. of input by 2. if any of these multiplied entries is greater than 9 subtract 9
not being viable for your case is because those parameterized queries are implemented using prepare statements a statement is sent to database parsed compiled and possibly optimized without the values being known at this time primary use case intended for prepare statements is performance improvements through reuse of the compiled statement the values are then provided in second step instructing the database to perform the statement with those values another set of values then may be sent to execute the prepare statement with etc
input var opt marklogic temp 0b71d7278e82c553 toconv.doc my code is as follows where the same code is working perfectly fine with .doc extensions if xdmp word-convert will not work with docx file what will be the other possible api functions which will do similar work other than xdmp document-filter
to copy the parts of the original arrays it s easier to use arrays.copyofrange than writing your own for-loop
first time i ve seen safari handle something better than google-chrome
update someone on discord helped me fixed it setcontentview has to be called before findviewbyid
so the common idiom for tasks like this is which would work even if folder were a complete path and more than one directory along the path needed to be added
but if the ienumerable is much larger than the iqueryable just filter the iqueryable as much as possible on the database side and then use asenumerable to pull it into memory and join there
problem if i use logging.basicconfig filename logfile there is no more terminal output from logging module. if i add another filehandler for the logfile this is only used by main module and not by sub modules example using python 2.7 update just found but example is not working no output on terminal or file info for newer python version . since python 3.3 logging.basicconfig can take a keyword argument handlers
you also need to scale flip the images so they plot together because the map is probably much finer resolution than the heatmap
this answer has nothing to do with why your uiscrollview doesnt work. uiscrollview will only scroll if its content size is greater than its frame size. you should first decide the size of your uiscrollview frame than for a veritical uiscrollview you should assign the content size as follow lets say you have 5 uiview s which have height of 5 dp each than you should set the uiscrollview height like so scrollview.setcontentsize width 5 5 . than if the uiscrollview frame height is greater than 25 the uiscrollview will not scroll
something like but i know for sure that is wrong-- i m just not familiar enough with keras and tensorflow to get the right code
here is the code in swift which can easily be converted to objective-c
what is required by standard chars is the smallest memory unit and has at least 8 bits - all other types have a size that is a multiple of the size of chars short has at least 16-bit int is at least as large as short and has at least 16-bit long is at least as large as int and has as least 32 bits long long is at least as large as long and has as least 64bit but for example you cannot know what is the most appropriate type to process 32 bits values
so what this says is that provided your subclassing doesn t have any more values than the superclass used to determine ordering implementing is reasonable
as a rule of thumb you should use the prototype scope for all beans that are stateful while the singleton scope should be used for stateless beans
the problem i m having with this code is that it will mark sentences shorter than 25 words if you include commas in the sentence - this might also happen with other punctuation marks but so far i ve experienced it with commas specifically
the dart s sdk is located at flutter bin cache dart-sdk however if android studio s flutter plugin is installed the plugin needs to be told where flutter s sdk is located
the second column is minlat is tested with a range so the rest of the columns won t be used for filtering or sorting
while doing so i found there s a script on the page which is near identical to what you would get with the request i simply stripped the portion of the script as well as the trailing semi-colon parsed that like you would with the request and used the data the same way - the actual post data is slightly more deeply nested but it s all there
in order to resolve this issue you will need to put your node.js server live with ssl certificate or secure https
and finally you can fit 3 characters into by using strncpy but the buffer cannot fit the terminating null character and therefore it cannot be printed using printf s but you can print it with specifying explicit field width that is less than or equal to the length of the array - however the printed out value would be padded and compiling running it but there is one extra space character printed after ab
in most cases firefox runs blazor apps much faster than google-chrome or edge which implies that browser makers still need to improve even firefox can improve
2 next given there are no details about the client-side part of the mcve i may have got the scenario idea incorectly so bear with me - there are only these compatible zeromq scalable formal communication archetype sockets matches available ever since up to api v4.2.x in 2018 q2 3 there is a good engineering practice not to let unhandled exception-handling happen the more if context -instance may still bear the possession of ip port# b locked resource sometimes even beyond the python process termination many incidents with my own naive and this way deadlocked experiments in my past dark history o each step in the infrastructure setup ought be wrapped into error-handling syntax-clause best including a finally section where so far created resources will occasionally get dismantled in a graceful manner in cases when exception-handling s spring out
i have more than ten ethernet ports no wireless etc
the other approach is that you don t actually give the value back until all children have updated times greater than their parent or whatever inputs are in your function. if you do an insert then the child nodes won t exist until they re processed but you ll have to handle the case where you query a node that doesn t exist due to a rebuild versus the case where you query a node that just doesn t exist
if you analyze your logic you can see that the data has the structure of a tree root measurements set 1 p1-p2 p3-p4 measurements set 2 p5-p6 p7-p8 so it will be used that qcombobox supports as a source of information to a model and to establish which sheet shows is used rootmodelindex in the next part i create a generic example that involves a qcombobox plus that is defined by another level in addition to observe the dependency will use a qtreeview
i m not familiar with vivus but gsap has a tool drawsvgplugin that does the same thing and much more as a club greensock benefit and it integrates seamlessly so your 30-ish lines of code could be condensed to 3 if you have any other questions i d encourage you to check out the gsap forums at
i would expect that for cellcontentclick to be triggered that mousedown and mouseup must both have been performed in the same cell
my question is how to deploy the code in a clean easy way on the haddop cluster every time i dod some modification so it can be schedule with oozie i guess oozie is the best option for scheduling since it is already installed i can pull the code from github on the edge note and then copy and overwite de files on hdfs ci cd is not yet in place and is planned to be used for the production hadoop cluster
then since your gui int fields are public you could use those directly but i prefer adding getter and setter methods
we could and git log --graph does also draw this as like human children git s children can have more than one parent
the division property conceptually is more about remainder than modulo
either way finding hlsl shaders is harder than finding glsl shaders opengl is kind of a universal thing... which can then be ported to hlsl
your first query needs just index publisher_network_id network_date -- in this order when optimizing tables that are larger than can be cached in ram the buffer_pool the overwhelming consideration is disk hits
yum makes it easier to maintain groups of machines without having to manually update each one using rpm
make sure all the maven dependencies should be included in pom.xml
to that end you are calling k.eval but at this stage you are still constructing a symbolic computation graph which will be run in tensorflow or theano
wrote the code responsible for sending a post message using the library i am not sure it works tbh since i could not run it built the maven project from within eclipse by doing pom.xml right click run as maven build .
while bsearch can use a comparison function that is also usable by qsort it isn t necessary to write the function that way.
also onblur is working better than onchange
your method must be named get or post
while chars can be assigned numerical values they are to be treated as int if they are
import atexit def clean_up # do some clean up .... atexit.register clean_up so function clean_up will be called when main thread exits
possible hack could be run apache nginx on that ec2
google-chrome rendering engine javascript engine ios ios webkit nitro javascriptcore android windows linux blink v8 in addition to innominatum answer note that google-chrome for android windows linux uses v8 javascript engine while google-chrome for ios has to use nitro engine same engine that powers safari in accordance with apple s requirements for browsers released through their app store ios version of google-chrome uses the ios webkit which is apple s own mobile rendering engine and components developed for their safari browser therefore it is restricted from using google s own v8 javascript engine so google-chrome and even firefox behaves fundamentally same as safari on ios. that s why shows just one support table ios safari for ios references
here is an extension for int to provide a correspondingletter function note that if the int is larger then 26 you ll get special chars
so i tried with onfocus event and i want to hide the suggestion when we click out of the textbox so i used onblur event
nginx would be easier to configure also it will be better than apache when it comes to serving static content like images and css files and so on
i ve tried it of different pcs browsers it is freezes only in google-chrome in google-chrome on a mac book it works much better then on pc but worse than in safari as example
isnull and coalesce do just about the same thing but isnull is t-sql while coalesce is more generic
however i m having trouble passing the loggedin state down to the child component so it can be used to show or hide the link based on the users state parent component child component
i am trying to import a kibana 6 visualization into elasticsearch 6 to be viewed in kibana
dropdown content will be shown on mouseenter and hidden on mouseleave or when window is scrolled like so here is the sample this works fine in desktop mode using mouse interaction but the problem occurs only when using tablet view i use chrome s developer tools to replicate this . so in tablet mode if you click on the hover me the dropdown content will show
but your first query if sql server specific i would rewrite it using row_number supported by mysql 8.0 mariadb sql server postgresql oracle h2 derby ... and then i would use named query
as stated in the documentation of the background property background-size cannot be set alone and it should be used with background-position
this error would occur when the number of folder in the target directory is greater than the number of items in your list
here is my pom.xml edited also i have found that spring boot can be compiled to jar as better way than war
it allows you to execute xcode-select without sudo permissions alternatively if that doesn t work for you you can try allowing xcode-select to be executed with sudo permissions but without the passwd i hope it helps
also a user-prompt loops is better implemented with a while-loop to avoid adding a frame to your call-stack everytime the user enters a wrong input
all of your dbms_output logic is inside the cursor for-loop so will only be evaluated within loops - when there is data
otherwise it is necessary to specify additionally i on copying multiple files or an entire directory tree to inform xcopy that the destination argument should be interpreted as folder path
i want to use the same ssl certificate for both so both can be accessed through https but i m not managing
a for-loop is much better than a while loops in this case
next you add the typeconverters annotation to the appdatabase class so that room can use the converter that you ve defined for each entity and dao in that appdatabase appdatabase.java a side note java.util.date is considered to be badly designed and java.util.calendar is much worse
actually the fix was simple by changing the event to mousedown like that at least for firefox and google-chrome this works much better
visibility means that the elements are not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0
your implementation was near perfect but the last line of code is redundant as visibilityofelementlocated returns the element once the element is visible the elements are not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0
i dont want to get the average because that would be to much at the moment my code has a nested for-loop and loops through 2 lists coinlist where all 100 symbols are listed like this list of indexes called a because the values and quantities are always at the same spot my code so what does this code do 1 loops through every symbol in the symbollist 2 for every found symbol i look for the available quantity 3 if my balance 10 eth is smaller than qty loops breaks 4 if not keeps searching and summarizing every qty in a sum list until there is enough
if i call make -j no number a huge number of compilers will be started and the processors will be used fully cpu states 80.5 user 5.0 kernel cpu 0 idle 15.2 cpu 1 idle 13.2 cpu 2 idle 14.7 memory 0 total 281m avail page size 4k pid tid pri state hh mm ss cpu command 8200 2 21 rcv 0 00 17 12.02 devb-eide 43565087 1 10 rdy 0 00 00 11.38 make 43819103 1 10 rply 0 00 00 3.01 cmake 43716678 1 10 rply 0 00 00 2.80 cmake 43671611 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.87 make 43589671 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.73 make 43569184 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.73 make 43573283 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.46 make 43667514 1 10 rply 0 00 00 1.28 make 43839590 1 10 send 0 00 00 1.10 cmake unfortunately when i use make -j having the huge number of concurrent builds means that my limited vm quickly runs out of memory
the reason c doesn t have it is that it s even worse than a goto you have to count the nested loops to figure out what it does and it s vulnerable to someone coming along later and adding or removing a level of nesting without noticing that the break count needs to be adjusted
given that your pull request is from branch pull-request to develop that could be just git checkout pull-request # check out files from develop they will be immediately staged git checkout develop -- file to revert other_file to revert git commit -m reverted files that should be reverted git push origin pull-request this should add the pull request to no longer include the offending files so you can simply merge it
please use task.dolast action instead. at build_3icce6xsgr7rsvstratajpe9b.run project build.gradle 138 the javacompile.setdependencycachedir method has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in gradlew 4.0. incremental java compilation is an incubating feature. the taskinputs.source object method has been deprecated and is scheduled to be removed in gradlew 4.0
in the third line negative s type will be deduced as short because you are casting the type of s from unsigned short to short
thus the super function should be written as super dev self .__init__ first last pay also for inheritance in python 2.7 your parent class should inherit from object
get only the second column using cut -d -f2 sort uniq -d to get repeated lines grep -fv 2r to exclude a value or grep -fv -e foo -e bar to exclude multiple values in other words something like this cut -d -f2 input.csv | sort | uniq -d | grep -fv 2r depending on the data it might be faster if you move grep earlier in the pipeline but you should verify that with some benchmarking
arrays of a size that isn t known at runtime can be allocated with alloca or malloc and then you need to access their contents with load and store
it is not advisable to compare two floats for equality like so it is not a good idea to try to invert the min max values in case min is greater and have a third option in case they are equal
this is how it can be done in objective-c here is how i achieved it in swift result
as item datatemplate i have contentcontrol with highlight converter so row will change color and itemspaneltemplate is virtualizingstackpanel and controltemplate of itemscontrol is scrollviewer with nested itemspresenter in background code viewmodel i have function which accepts string and search this string in observablecollection which contains all rows and textblock are made from each row
i think it can be done with addition subtraction multiplication and bitwise operation like bit-shift
you can have http and https servers in the same server section for complete ssl related configuration i would recommend to use mozilla generator yes but you shouldn t
since java does not have an explicit unsigned integer form the best you can do is apply a bitwise operation to the item in advance of displaying it force it to be considered unsigned ...or you can display it using it s hex format which is inherently unsigned
this doesn t work for constexpr values that cannot be passed as non-type template parameters but it does work for integers and pointers and function pointers
you have to give fixed width and height to the .navbar-brand class and then just add following css to the img inside as it will cover up the whole .navbar-brand live example
you can use jsonview s to specify which fields should be included during serializable deserialization
hashmap order not maintains faster than linkedhashmap used for store heap of objects linkedhashmap linkedhashmap insertion order will be maintained slower than hashmap and faster than treemap if you want to maintain an insertion order use this
building a heap only enforces the property in case of min heap every parent is lesser than it children in case of max heap every parent is greater than its children
since optimized efficiency is your goal we ll speed things up very slightly by using to multiplying a small int value by eight and to perform floored division by two on a positive int solution with slightly improved efficiency we can gain further efficiency at the cost of bad design by combining all three methods into one
as shown below the cluster s height margin is obviously less than its width margin
wait or queue subsequent executions and continuing to process based on fifo
the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself
the rule of the thumb is cascading should be done from parent to children
in today s modern servers with pretty fast multi-core processors it is more common for a given server request to be limited by i o than by cpu
having said that using functions from tensorflow directly is ok as well say from import tensorflow and use those inside a custom layer might give you more functions than keras backend alone
i have an input type of datetime-local which is working fine in google-chrome but when i try to run the same page in firefox it shows text box instead of datepicker.i have tried using modernizer but still the problem exist can anyone tell me how could the datetime-local issue can be fixed in firefox
i expected the for-loop to be the fastest followed very closely by the while-true loops then the trampolining loops taking 2-10x longer than the for-loop and the naive function loops to take 10-100x longer than the for-loop
all we have is and or and not that s why it s hard to implement a sub circuit so now same circuit could be used for addition as well as subtraction which uses 2s complement hack in to perform subtraction by doing addition
gremlin execution time is 50 times more than cypher query. here is the cypher query

with haskell s do notation the above would be written as put and get work with the state being manipulated updated and passed around implicitly
fist of all don t send passwords in the url -- it s just really bad security as the query parameters can get logged in apache or nginx logs and are often exposed along the way
machines have same browser version as mine google-chrome safari browser
solution 1 use virtualbox if you think it s not good idea see solution 2 below open virtualbox you have it already installed along with the docker tools create virtual machine this is optional you can skip it and forward ports from the vm create second ethernet card - bridged this way it will receive ip address from your network it will have ip like docker machine install ubuntu lts which is older than 1 year install docker add shared directory to the virtual machine and automount your project directory this way you have access to the project directory from ubuntu but still can work in windows done bonus everything is working the same way as on linux pause unpause the dockerized environment whenever you want solution 2 use virtualbox this is very similar to the solution 1 but it shows also the thinking process which might be usefull when solving similar issues read that somebody move the folder to c users public and that works try it realize that it doesn t have much sense in your case
with html css this would normally be done via mousedown mouseup and mousemove events adjusting the width dynamically
having a local git clone that you have to git add commit push then go to the server and git pull is even more dumb
the way functions without prototypes are called is the arguments are promoted lesser than int int types to int and float s to double s and passed to the function in an implementation-defined way
we re using one _mm_add_epi16 two _mm_unpackxx_epi16 and two _mm_sub_ps for 8 values the _mm_castsi128_ps are no-ops and the _mm_set would be cached in registers usage demonstration if your input would have been unsigned short the _mm_add_epi16 would not be necessary and the in the _mm_sub_ps would need to be removed of course
as spark-sql uses hive serdes to read the data from hdfs it is much slower than reading hdfs directly
exim can be made to add argument addresses instead of subtract them by setting the option extract_addresses_remove_arguments false
in this instance libjsoncpp.a had symbols like json value std __1 basic_string a constructor that takes a string because it was build with clang and expecting to be linked with llvm s libc++ but i was ultimately attempting to link the final executable with gnu s libstdc++ and the symbol json value std basic_string was unresolved
and then set the margin of .outer .inner nth-child 3 .outer .inner nth-child 4 by making the child 3 and 4 to have set its margin and width that will still not exceeds to width of the .outer so that they will still be inline to each other and the other child will occupy the whole row because their margin and width is equal to the width of the .outer
firstly i tried to manually create instance of jsonobject class provided by gson but it has not implemented getters and can t be serialized by jackson
the chars y will be converted to int 121 try this system.out.println int y
in the case that the associated store eventually does become globally visible you have an interesting time-travel type effect the load on the local cpu has potentially seen the store much earlier than other processors and in particular perhaps it sees it out of order with respect to other stores on the system
your code is wrong because n cannot be converted to int as it is not a numerical chars
i had php versioning 5.5 and i needed to upgrade to 5.6
i could ve used properties with value 2.0.1.release inherited from spring-boot-parent pom but there is none such properties as far as i can see
there seems to be a couple of issues which you ned to address as follows selenium versioning logs in node depicts selenium versioning 3.12.0 revision 7c6e0b3 time 2018-05-08t15 15 08.936z logs in console depicts selenium versioning 3.6.0 revision 6fbf3ec767 time 2017-09-27t15 28 36.4z jdk versioning logs in node depicts java.version 1.8.0_144 logs in console depicts java.version 1.8.0_77 node startup command the command which you have used to register the node looks error-pront as follows it should have been solution upgrade jdk in selenium grid hub and selenium grid node to recent levels jdk 8u171
in your example if you pass any argument the default value will be ignored and if you do not uncaught referenceerror will be thrown as width and height does not exist provided not defined globally or in the function scope
here the first value in the array will be assigned to width and the second value will be assigned to height
you could have saved as png too then use imagepng instead of image gif
obviously your checkrate will not measure thefunciwanttomeasure correctly so just to show that a settimeout fn 0 loop will fire at higher rate now even if a nested settimeout loop is better than setinterval what you are doing is a visual animation
i m having jsf application and have upgrade the mojarra versioning from 2.2.15 to 2.3.0 and found that restore view is taking more time than 2.2.15 versioning attached the image
i thought that for a min-priority heap the elements should be ordered from min to max heapq.heapify li should be the same as li.sort could someone help me understand
in your specific case all the delimiter are more than one spaces whereas the spaces in the names are just single spaces
first change apache listen port 80 to 8080 apache in etc apache2 ports.conf include listen 1.2.3.4 80 to 1.2.3.4 8080 sudo service apache2 restart or sudo service httpd restart in case of centos then add nginx as reverse proxy server that will listen apache port after changes restart nginx server sudo service nginx restart now all traffic will be handled by nginx server and send all dynamic request to apache and static conten is served by nginx server
the orginal uav image s metadata can not be recognized by gdal so i have to extract them out and then rearrange them to proj the array
when i switch to other browsers launcher such as firefox or safari the problem goes away
any hdfs user account you create should exist as an os or pam or ldap user on the namenode at the very least for any permissions to successfully get acknowledged by hdfs clients
if you read the red line you ll see an error likely around state being an abstract class that expects one or more methods to be defined instance getter and setter methods can be abstract defining an interface but leaving its implementation up to other classes in this case i believe state expects the build method
a max-heap works the same way except the root is the largest node rather than the smallest and parent are larger than their children
meaning the same route name can be used for post and get and other methods which usually lead to different controller methods or even controllers
the 2nd error is permute_all_list_numbers.java 48 error incompatible types chars cannot be converted to int permute sequence 0
i have a checkbox and then i have an anchor tag that displays some text and then will have chevron button to toggle either up or down
probably easier to use a nested map instead achieving the same thing with a for-loop is much more verbose and confusing and shouldn t be done in most cases arrays methods have better abstraction and don t require manual iteration but if necessary
no it s not mandatory to deployed war file microservices can also be deployed as jar or war file on the server
simple event timing can be achieved with settimeout and setinterval they work the same as in browser side javascript
both setcategorybitmask and getcategorybitmask seems to be simplet setter and getter however so i have no idea what is happening here
we re working with gitlab 8.16.4 and i want to upgrade it but since the backups are not compatible between versioning i want to make sure everything is ok first
result summary numeric 5 million loops int 1.08 sec 20 faster than variant long 1.09 sec single 1.29 sec variant 1.34 sec double 1.37 sec numeric 25 million loops variant 6.16 sec variant is 9 faster than string string 6.76 sec numbers stored as text 5 million loops int 5.45 sec variant is 32 faster than int variant 7.99 sec therefore it it true arrays of non-variant data types are handled up to 20 faster than an array of variants
when it comes to interfaces the keyword extends can be seen as implements for classes
similarly a 4-level assignment can be made using minimum 1st quartile median 3rd quartile and the maximum
edit regarding parent-child relation our solution for root of diagram was to extend anchor pane as he gives most control to its children every node on this anchor pane had to be umlelement which further down spreads to umlnode and umledge then umlnode has sub-types parentumlnode and childumlnode child can be put inside parent and their position is bound to parent position it doesn t care about outside because of that once parent moves his children follow him respectively
that s why a 32-bit client code should be built as x86 and 64bit as x64
it is because in last iteration of your loops you are accessing the element which is not in the arrays index is higher than size of arrays so try this when length of the string is even you need to keep an edge case check explicitly after your for-loop
it has already been fixed in debian and will be included in ubuntu shortly
it has already been fixed in debian and will be included in ubuntu shortly
on the outmost for-loop iterates over an arrays this arrays is more specifically a list of objects where each contains an arrays with codes that i need to use in order to reach some information provided by an external api for the sake of simplicity i am using mockup objects data resultofrequest code1 code2 code3 resultofrequest code4 code5 code6 .
this is also a situation where aggregation one class has other classes makes more sense than inherited a subclassing is a superclass
for efficiency in common case of simple case of normal non virtual single inherited the semantics of the vptr of the base class that we then call a primary base class will be augmented with new properties so the vtable for x will be augmented the layout and semantics of the vtable for d will be augmented any properties of a vtable for d is also a properties of the vtable for x the semantic will be inherited there s an inherited of the vtables in parallel with the inherited inside the classes
point 2 - a number leading with zero and do not contain 8 or 9 in remaining number will be considered as octal and converted to decimal when printing its value
however a single pipe can be used by children to relay information back to the parent
to have it available within the code module only private booradio as boolean to have it available within the whole vba project all modules user forms and for the workbook and worksheet events public booradio as boolean when vba starts all boolean variables get initialized to be false likewise all int or long get initialized to be 0 string to be etc.
in case of authentication failure 401 http status will be returned endpoint post api auth logout headers - authorisation bearer token invalidates authorisation token by storing token in appropriate table so that user cannot have access to the protected api with given token endpoint get api auth validate headers - authorisation bearer token validates given token must be called before processing request in servicea
i have a form like this in my chrome i can see it will be send as post but if i do this i get this result and i have no idea why
just to keep being able to use 32 bit drivers i compiled a second version in x86 mode which can be used in 64bit environments to address 32 bit odbc drivers
all you have to do is a request generally post containing the data you want to be converted and get a pdf back
yep after a lot of search i found there are three databases approach to build a saas product separate databases for each tenant separate schemas tables and common one database for all tenants shared tables and one database for all tenants finally i decided to use option 2 and i moved to postgresql instead of mysql because postgresql has schema based approach
your basic operation can be computed using for row 1 of a the list can be done using lapply - the other options don t give options for the right input output tapply requires a vector input apply only allows a matrix output
in the given question the superclass is the one that has a more general object as the parameter while the subclassing is more specific
in my question the subclassing is less specific than the superclass meaning the subclassing is always able to handle whatever the superclass requires
this can be done with charindex and substr
you can use map in this case some data we will use df2 to create a dictionary which can be used to map id to quantity
i have been happily transpiling a typescript library of mine to cjs for some time but decided i wanted to transpile to es2015 to get more out tree-shaking
i m looking for ways to improve the efficiency of the following calculation the two data.tables that i am relying on look as follows sapply dlong class origpat ref.pat jac originv refinv idx numeric numeric numeric int int int and sapply pp class pnum inventors pryear pr_date inv_patc iid int chars int date numeric int my objective is thus to look for the inventors in origpat and ref.pat they are stored in pp as chars in column inventors and as int in iid i am assuming that int matching should be faster than chars matching
finally i decided to use option 2 and i moved to postgresql instead of mysql because postgresql has schema based approach
project dependencies such as static archives that were built against libstdc++ will also need to be rebuilt against libc++
so on calling popviewcontrolleranimated in controller second then controller first viewwillappear will be called then viewdidappear is called viewwillappear animated for controller first will be called
what we tried initially the queues had pre-fetch set to 1 and consumers to be min of 2 and max of 5 we removed pre-fetch and we added more consumers as max concurrency setting but the issue is still there the delay just takes longer to present but after a few minutes the processing starts to take around 20 30 seconds
you can think that s my opinion but if you look at the direction things have moved in the industry you ll see that it s not just my opinion. if a person is not in the habit of periodically fetching and seeing if new changes exist they ll find out when they try to push because the push will be rejected and they ll be instructed to pull and merge in the changes at that point
in my experiments the space after the # seems to be required in google-chrome and not in firefox which basically means it s required
info mostly this app will be run on google-chrome and safari
eval already does what you want if your project does truly demand wrapping eval in a lambda if you are using sympy lambdify is a more robust alternative that comes with multiple backends
create swift framework geolens.swift when i am trying to access in objective-c project cannot call 2 methods createuser startsessionforuser getting error like this method cannot be marked objective-c because the type of the parameter cannot be represented in objective-c
notes especially when using -r to change entire directory this makes go-rwx more useful as the e x ecutable flag is usually only set on folder so they can be entered and program files. using 700 would add the e x ecutable flag to all files that don t have it yet which is usually not what you d want to do
moreover the heatmap can be produced with heatmap apiris1 which is as follows as seen in the plot above the different colors on the top and left side depicts the total number of clusters
the easiest way should be to test if your positions are superior than 0 for left and top and lower than #container width and height for respectively right and bottom
here s some ideas store log entries in parquet format in s3 to be later queried using redshift spectrum parse log entries and send them to a redshift database parse log entries and send them to a elasticsearch cluster to be queried using kibana etc
under one plausible definition of average case quicksort is expected to do about 40 more comparisons than mergesort
in your case the character is u+252 ü which can be substituted with decimal octal or hexidecimal
declare int like an array of chars compare userinput as ascii not as int you can compare it as int but you have to use the int that corresponds with the chars on the ascii table delete the cin.ignore line
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value
however if two objects do not compare as equals the gethashcode methods for the two objects do not have to return different values
the heatmap plot is more appropriate for hierarchical clustering
if the settimeout lasts more than 1 second that the setinterval lasts i break the loop since the setinterval does not wait for that time to pass it is executed again
it seems like you are using an ndk versioning that is no more supporting some abis armeabi in you error log so you have to upgrade build in build.gradle project .... to the latest one classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 3.1.3 and in gradle-wraper.properties and finally you have to add abifilters in android block of your build.gradle module app depending of wich abis you need
see the detailed tutorial about how to use one here you can use listview or gridview which is more suitable for you
every string operation in nsis can be coded with strcpy strcmp and strlen
bunch of steps but should be clear add a scrollview set constraints as normal add a uiview to scrollview - name it contentview set constraints 0 for top leading trailing bottom of contentview to scrollview set width and height of contentview equal to width and height of scrollview add a stackview to contentview set stackview to vertical fill fill spacing 20 set stackview constraints top 8 bottom 8 leading 40 trailing 40 to contentview set stackview centery constraint to contentview add three labels to stackview set fonts and text set number of lines 0 for center and bottom labels change stackview top and bottom constraints to change contentview height constraint to priority 250 i think that s everything..
ems is a broker that supports standard protocols jms tcp rv has focus on low latency like zeromq or maybe akka point-to-point over tcp or point-to-point over udp or multicast over udp licensed per server messages are sent via topic supports topics with wildcard segments that don t require specific routing rules or explicit subscriptions to receive data from new topics after tibco acquired 29west rv seems to be evolved from the 29west low-latency message bus broker for any fans of low-latency messaging 29west and or rendezous rv i would recommend taking a look at zeromq a.k.a
i am trying to pass a list of strings from the server-side to be used on client-side
this can also be done with lubridate package in tidyverse which is what i prefer
if you don t want to install imagemagick then you should link your code with libjpeg library and enable native jpg file support in cimg putting this before including cimg.h #define cimg_use_jpeg #include cimg.h using cimg with libjpeg is definitely better
if yes then i recommend you to create one or more plugin s if not then you can upgrade your code first to next released versioning and so on..and then finally upgrade it to 3.80
i have a table with the schema shown below for each id i want the n1 corresponding to max h and n2 corresponding to min l where n1 and n2 are row numbers expected output id n1 n2 1 3 10 and similar for each id if the max or min value repeats more than once only the first one is considered i tried select n1 max h n2 min l from t group by id it gives me an error error column n1 must appear in the group by clause or be used in an aggregate function help is super appreciated
due to policies in vsts can t push branch updates these can only be done through pull requests
also pypy works in the vast majority of cases and is usually much faster than cpython
you could make a hacky solution by setting your button height 12 more than the width and also changing the padding but i would not suggest it
i want the form method to be set to get instead of post
in my case when soft keyboard is opened width of the screen becomes greater than height note that i m calculating the height as full screen height - soft keyboard height
i would recommend to prefer using settimeout instead of setinterval indeed the browser may be overhelmed by heavy processing and in that case you would probably prefer updating the clock less often instead of queuing several updates of the state
although you declared grain as a double which can go well beyond 2 63 your calculations like will be registered as int which only range to 2 147 483 647 leading to an overflow and these high unrecognizable values
this solution is in swift can be adapted to objective-c
i m making outlook vsto add-in that launches wpf window
you re building up your total in a double and then doing this which is as radiodef said if temp s value is greater than integer.max_value int temp will be integer.max_value 2147483647 which when divided by 1000 with int division is .
add listener property with getter and setter in your component controller
for such models would keras be a better option since it is more high level than tensorflow
based on the implementation a circle is a specific ellipse so i would have used inherited here each subclassing of polygon are abstract those are used for the validation of the number of corners
this normally more apparent with post requests but is also applicable to get requests
udp server cannot be transformed into tcp server
if you really want your tiles to be squares try saving the plot and setting width to be much much larger than height
the intel x86 encoder decoder software library is an open-source library that can be used to decoder and encode x86 machine code
i had the same issue and ended up downloading the package from in rhel7.5 this package can be installed with rpm -ivh ruby-devel-2.0.0.648-33.el7_4.x86_64.rpm also the development tools can be installed before that using yum groupinstall development tools

so this macro a+b c becomes because multiplication has higher precedence that addition it gets performed first
as said by kirill karandin you can write a generic method the difference is that the inner sum will return 0 if x is either less than of min or greater than of max
unfortunately i should make each date cell to have height smaller than width that s why i set app mcv_tileheight to 40dp in xml
after i provide my selector drawable it gets stretched all over the bounds of cell. but i want it to scale like square not like rectangle that being said if width of view date in my case is bigger than height i expect to have empty space on left and right
if you re using multiprocess which is a forked version of multiprocessing that pre-substitutes dill for pickle it s less obvious how to patch that

where i work malloc free is slower and more inefficient than new delete for two reasons free does not know the size of the object whereas delete often has this size at compile-time
instead you can search for the last space in the string and take anything before it as the name make sure it is less than 15 chars + 1 null terminator and everything after the space you pass to strtol which converts it to int
the question is old but if you were to do it nowadays i d recommend using prometheus as data source for grafana along with it s jmxexporter agent on cassandra
so in some of the case my data interval is not linear diffrence between min value and max is very large
it s installed with lxml in fact you probably want to use lxml instead of libxml2 because lxml is based on libxml2 is more pythonic sudo pip install lxml libxml2 page says note that some of the python purist dislike the default set of python bindings rather than complaining i suggest they have a look at lxml the more pythonic bindings for libxml2 and libxslt and check the mailing-list
so if your parent documents have less than 100 children why not otherwise i d seriously consider going another approach
you may try the firefox browser which is less strict than google-chrome in this regard
now what if the containing block is an inline level element like having a p inside a span which you don t often see for obvious reasons i guess this speaks for it self the height here is shorter the height gets larger in the other example only when we add width 100 because we push the text downward therefore the height increases the same doesn t happen in this example width 100 has no effect so it is safe to say that the elements gets outside then the parent follows could be a bug could be how it was intended to behave
it work like this in jtextfield i need to put a word then after click enter this world must be added to jlist
also if it is possible to make sure the min is lower than max
that sum could be accumulated with integer arithmetic although floating-point would suffice up to the point where integers can no longer be represented exactly
i have to create a temp table at some point in order to present the data and what is really strange is that on the ubuntu system it takes 400 ms response from browser and on the debian it takes more than 10 seconds

this is basically all you need you dont need e and when iterating an arrays from begin till end or return before a for-loop is easier to read and write than a while
you can choose between orchestration and choreography in your microservices based on what fits best for your use case based something similar lines of above mentioned explanation
also make sure to include jquery this is possible paste this beneath all other scripts to your .userhasscrolled class you can set something like this --first answer-- what you ask for is media screen and max-width 767px while the screen width has a lower size than 767px you can define an overwriting css style like this but this causes another problem while the navbar is closed the main class will still have a margin of -336px and that s not what you want i guess
given the fact there is always as chance to define how many io-threads are to be spawned in a to be instantiated lets put it short a zero-io-thread equipped context 0 will spawn itself as a thread + 0 io-threads 1 thread a solo-io-thread equipped context 1 will spawn itself as a thread + 1 io-thread 2 threads a more-io-threads equipped context n will spawn itself as a thread + n io-thread 1+n threads given the experiment above the real composition in-vivo could get easily validated

for people who ended up here having the same problem but have too many nodes here are few simple improvements on hooked s answer although i am sure there are better solutions out there as hooked mentioned in comments this is just a quick copy-paste fix for people who ended up here with the same reason as i did and had scaling problems 1 igraph scales way better than networkx 2 we can only take a neighborhood of a node to eliminate most of the unnecessary combinations for example if we are looking for a motif in larger network both igraph objects
syntax malloc takes 1 argument the size to be allocated and calloc takes two arguments number of blocks to be allocated and size of each block
example the same functionality as calloc can be achieved using malloc and memset note that malloc is preferably used over calloc since it s faster

besides changing the c++ standard library build setting developers should audit hard-coded linker flags and target dependencies to remove references to libstdc++ including -lstdc++ -lstdc++.6.0.9 libstdc++.6.0.9.tbd and libstdc++.6.0.9.dylib . project dependencies such as static archives that were built against libstdc++ will also need to be rebuilt against libc++
the solution is as zephyr mentioned to move the actual processing into a seperate class which inherites javafx.concurrent.service. the data exchange with this class has to be implemented with getter setter and events
though it would require the application to be adjusted in probably many places and if your mysql versioning is older an upgrade of the database
strtok modifies its input - so a temporary buffer is used for safety it checks for invalid characters - and will return a non-zero return code if found strtol has been used instead of atoi - as it can detect non-numeric characters in the input scanf has not been used to slurp the input - due to rounding issues with floating point numbers the base for strtol has been explicitly set to 10 to avoid problems with leading zeros otherwise a leading zero will cause the number to be interpreted as octal it uses a num_simple_fraction helper not shown - which in turn uses a gcd helper also not shown - to convert the result to a simple fractions log10 of the numerator is determined by calculating the length of the token after the decimal point

i m trying to construct a codebase where subsystems can be developed as maven modules without the importing pom.xml needing to concern itself with the internal structure of the maven module
solution that is pretty close to what i want but not really the solution what i want - open a small pop-up dialog that tells user to crop their image when the select image input button is clicked
edit as klutt pointed out this solution adds some bias of its own since the obtained number has a 50 chance to be lower than your min and a 50 chance to be higher than your max regardless of size difference between the two intervals
using the google-chrome dev tools option to copy the selector on the inspector i can get the most specific selector posible for the html structure you have so aplying a 200 size to this element tricks the table to not missbehave tested on google-chrome firefox and safari my working code hope this helps
when in is closed in the implicit finally block zipinputstream will also be closed because bufferedinputstream is a subclass of filterinputstream which closes its source when itself get closed
you now have three clean options a standard ubuntu package docker.io a snap package from docker inc which has some restrictions on where your dockerfile is and is 5 months more out-of-date than the ubuntu package but works on more linux distros the official docker-ce package from docker inc which requires their private repo and more install steps for more helpful instructions details and references see askubuntu docker-ce or docker.io package
for starting out your pom.xml file should have these directories this is for maven and and these should be under the so in the end your pom.xml should look like this subsequently you should right click your maven project run run as maven install and it should install properly

that being said given that the threading module doesn t come with a pool interface i often find myself using multiprocessing.dummy.pool or multiprocessing.pool.threadpool instead for i o heavy stuff not restrict by the gil when shared memory is more important than shared processing and the overhead that it incurs
you do not need check if it is int since int number can also be parsed to double
i specify if width greater than height the and if width less than height and
it may take the following configurations for hide the parent directory link indexignore should be written as show in the code above
c source files should be compiled by gcc not by g++
c++ source files should be compiled by g++ not by gcc
in any case you should always use powers of two so your multiplication and divisions can be implemented as bit-shift and the modulo calculations as simple and-operation with some appropriate mask
use the ceiling function as suggested by rezaaghaei third you should not substract x y from the height width your calculations should be done as width scale
however you can try to change the limit by editing the web.config of the tfs site follow the instruction mentioned in this article easy ways to upload and validate large files in asp.net if you use iis7 and you want to upload files larger than the restrict 30000000 bytes or 28.6 mb you can add the following code to your web.config file in order to set that value to 100 mb if that still not work then please shared the steps to reproduce the issue especially for the large number of html tables and lots of text you mentioned you can store the strings in a file e.g word if it s too large then shared the file in onedrive or another site we can access
the problem occurs when a serializable is slower then the next request s deserialization

let me help you with a simple manner - lets assume we are going to use whatsapp app when you click on the app the methods that will be called are oncreate onstart onready lets now assume you pressed home button and the app got minimized the methods that will be called are onresume onpause onstop and now lets assume now you are going back to the minized whatsapp app methods that will be called are onrestart onstart now lets assume you just closed the app and removed it from task manager the methods that will be called are onstop ondestroy here is a diagram to get the sequence
i wanted to use holoviews with bokeh to get their color legend as i prefer it over bokeh s disjoint grouping one
the device s path is a string which can be passed to createfile to create a handle suitable for use with deviceiocontrol
now you just need an array of int that is larger than 0 must fit any chars that might appear as input the set of the chars should be specified somewhere but a safe number would be 256 for ascii a loop a condition that terminates the loop chars from input . and you are almost done reading and counting no functions needed for it
however i need to dynamically type cast it based on the for-loop number if loops is less than 3 i need to type cast the object to customswitchview otherwise i need to type cast it to customtripleswitchview

when i change only height to be greater than width arrows remain in the previous size... i also tried using this is the previous arrow from chrome inspect img is inside that div
to properly handle this type of data structure requires that each item be looped through arrays method or a for-loop
you have too many double values to read all of them using qint8 type as counter. counter has type qint8 so you can hold signed int in range when you assign value greater than 127 in your file there are more double values than 127 to your counter variable it is treated as negative number and your app crash while calling index operator because counter numberitems is negative value
joining on int is much faster as int are 4 bytes per row vs string which in mysql is 1 per chars length latin1 encoding + 1 byte
hey hemil in pls number system convention if you use zero as a prefix number will be considered as octal number but compiler will convert it into decimal number system and gives output in decimal. 02000 is in octal and its decimal value will be 1024
i am working on a project where the keypad should provide inputs and all the chars should be converted into int values and my code is as follows everything is fine the prob comes when i am pressing the del key it is deleting elements sometimes from the beginning of the output. output is 7.77 pressed back 7.7 pressed back 7.77770
i am trying to have for-loop statement inside another for-loop statement where table_name used in the inner for-loop query is result of first for-loop body of inner loops is much more complex
if speed is your concern base r can be faster than stringr stringi the only consequence is that the na is turned into a literal nana here so the workaround is which makes base r about as fast as stringi and slightly faster than stringr in this case. i m mildly annoyed that paste converts na to na though that s already been addressed here on so .
here is 2018 update for you your off-the-shelf solutions are red 5 pro wowza kurento unreal media server flashphoner also note that in modern public networks tcp is not much slower than udp
example 1 since unsigned chars is smaller than int we apply the int promotion on them then we have int x- int y int -1 and unsigned int -1 4294967295

after run selenium tests many times in the background i found that browsers will have given max and min sizes
therefore since string values can be parsed to double values if they meet certain criteria and double can be converted back to int assuming their values do not exceed the max value for int i decided to sum at the double level and then convert back to int at the implementation of the method to ensure no numeric values are missed
also due to deserialization of the data it will take more memory than the serializable disk data
also make sure that you are getting a string as a response from the server if it s a jsonobject i again recommend to use a wrapper data class loginresponsemodel and define the json structure as an object that could be parsed by gson or moshi
i think you might not have added the getter and setter methods related to your new variable z

using server-side rendering in react does not imply that react will not be used on client-side
this can be either a literal of type o or a binary expression containing expressions that represent more specialised number types than o int being more specialised than double
because query is ienumerable and hence can t be combined with iqueryable s into one expression and then translated into one sql statement
can anyone help me because i really don t get it that is my testng file and that is my setup method i m using selenide which is a wrapper on selenium but that s not the point. the point is that i want the same tests to be run on google-chrome 2 here and firefox to here . when i run them on debug then everything is okay and 2 tests are done on firefox and another 2 on google-chrome
this function can be passed any range of numbers you like i just set the minimum at 455 as that is the lowest valid number to save some computing time because i am packing it into a set the output is out of order so i sort it
i have searched for the various rest api library to consume rest api in .net core 2.0. i found that httpwebrequest is the original class provided by .net. webclient is wrapper of httpwebrequest. restsharp implementation is easy than httpclient. i am confused which library should i use and which support .net core 2.0

as a member of the outerclass a nested class can be declared private public protected or package private
update this question is marked as a possible duplicate of another question which answers how to sort but i need more than sorting a coping the list b filtering out elements c sort it
but there are some exceptions for small int between -5 and 256 and small strings interned strings with a special length usually less than 20 chars which are singletons and have same id actually one object with multiple pointer
my previous solution involved monitoring the individual files but this is error-prone as some files may be forgotten my next solution is to take a hash of the directory structure in one resource and use this hash as a trigger in the second this works okay except changes to mydir-checksum are only picked up after the first apply
the issue with children referring to their parent is more complex
your question is a little ambiguous but i believe your activation would be on mouseover or hover and your click would be completed on mouseup or click perhaps you are talking about mouse capture which is not an event at all but a behavior as michaeltracy has stated
chars strings cannot be compared to int which is what you are trying to do with your if block
the width of the canvas should be set to height set to you have both set as which will not work
if those are smaller than dbl_max_10_exp the range of double is greater than the range of int and we can cast int_max and int_min to double
if this operation overflows it means the range of double is smaller than the range of int and we can use dbl_max -dbl_max as max_double_to_int and min_double_to_int respectively
here jquery script code if checkbox length is greater than 1 then submt button will be enabled
a bit of history before nsurlsession came out a third party library afnetworking became the de facto standard for doing networking in objective c as it provided an easier and more convenient api than nsurlconnection which it was a wrapper around - i think these days it wraps nsurlsession instead
i have configured jar.version as dynamic input to pom.xml i tried to configure maven goal in eclipse s run configuration as i also tried to add jar.version 1.0.1 in parameter section of maven run configuration. but this parameter is not accessible by maven build process
note if you load data from hdfs to hive inpath the data will be moved from hdfs location to hive
in my situation using the uibutton was the best solution because i had a simple single line text i didn t want to use uiview as a container for uilabel i wanted to simplify math calculations for autolayout in my cell i didn t want to use nsparagraphstyle because tailindent works incorrect with autolayout width of uilabel is smaller than expected i didn t want to use uitextview because of possible side effects i didn t want to subclass uilabel less code fewer bugs that s why using the contentedgeinsets from uibutton in my situation become the easiest way to add text margins
int represents a double performance hit listarray with iterator is 3x slower than int
edit after groing through the source code while debugging i have found out that in fragmentnavigator.navigate fragmenttransaction.setreorderingallowed is called which allows reordering of operations even allowing oncreate of a new fragment to be called before ondestroy of the previous
since aes is much faster than rsa and aes is much shorter than the actual message
it would resize the width or height whichever is larger to the maximum pixel size and change the size of the other dimension to be proportional it would not skew or distort the image when resizing it
post example put example business logic id should not be passed in post request and will be ignored if passed
installing pyicu from the conda-forge channel can be achieved by adding conda-forge to your channels with conda config --add channels conda-forge once the conda-forge channel has been enabled pyicu can be installed with conda install pyicu this solves the problem and it will install pyicu with dependencies
this method would need fixed height and width to work
both ways lower the level of the binary heap i am just curious as to why the minimum would be chosen assuming both children are not smaller than parent why is the smaller of the two larger children chosen instead of one of them arbitrarily to be clear these methods below also belong to the binaryheap class the code for the binary heap class is
then when dennis ritchie started to cook together some manner of de facto standard for c he apparently decided that chars literals should always be promoted to int
if you would rather use glassfish then you might do better with amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk which should support glassfish 4.0
52429 is the closest integer to 2 19 10 so division by 10 can be achieved by multiplying by 52429 and then dividing by 2 19 where the latter is a trivial bit shift operation instead of requiring a full division
to permit broadcasting with boolean arrays you can use numpy.ix_ the magic ix_ performs is noted in the docs boolean sequences will be interpreted as boolean masks for the corresponding dimension equivalent to passing in np.nonzero boolean_sequence . as a side note you can use a more direct approach if you have int indices see also related question on why this method does not work with boolean arrays
before installing scikit-learn numpy and scipy have been successfully installed as much as matplotlib and pandas thanks in advance for your help - here is the partial screenshot of the problem
its not accessible by keyboard mouse
so using the approach suggested in the article i changed the code to give tablenames as a parameter to generate new observables and use switchmap i could have used concatmap flatmap but switchmap suited my requirements
furthermore the clustering of the pk in innodb may make your main selects run faster than with myisam which handles indexes differently
have tried with addclass removeclass but no change in html onclick
several options or if it can be marked constexpr like in this case which can be simplified to because in c++17 constexpr implies inline for static data members
note that i use the scrollheight and scrollwidth which i think will load much nicer than using height and width like the answer provided
my problem is similar with mysql select rows with more than one occurrence but i am using postgresql
afaics azure vault represents keys as com.microsoft.azure.keyvault.webkey.jsonwebkey which appears to be limited to rsa or aes

details it seems the latest version of swrl api is 2.0.5 and swrlapi-drools-engine 2.0.5 are not compatible with owl api 5.1.0
the precipitating 0 causes it to be interpreted as octal which is then converted into decimal to bind to the int
onclick event on option tag will fail on most versions of ie safari and google-chrome remove onclick from option.it should be handle by onchange event on select box
but i want to use all of the stuff on ubuntu since linux works better for the stuff i want to develop. everything works fine from the point of downloading anaconda for linux running it in the terminal and installing it
if the image is more high the height should be the max-height width is less than 100
we have a third party api for uploading a file which requires transfer-encoding header to be set to chunked but this header gets ignored from the header if i set it manually using xhr.setrequestheader
values of int types that are smaller than int chars and short are converted to int ¹
so any callback function passed to c code should be declared as noexcept and handle error in some manner that does not involve throw of exception across language boundary
based on this the full steps to fix this issue would be brew uninstall python2 brew update brew upgrade openssl brew install python2
however i have no idea how this problem is supposed to be handled in linux in general and in debian and ubuntu in particular
either the state ui boundary line would have to be removed or parent state would need to be passed down to children both of which are terrible solutions
in order to make the javascript work in a vertical orientation you should use css and style the container your slider element to be vertical having a smaller width than height
hevc h.265 is more complex
not totally familiar with nginx or apache log but i think most logs contain a timestamp an http request the document requested and status etc. and an ip address
they can be used for chars short int long and also long long
this question doesn t make much sense as it excludes sed and awk which would be the obvious answers and also restricts the solution to a for-loop whereas a while loops is the more usual choise
if your compiler supports c++11 you can just use range-based for-loop which is much easier to read than this normal loops
you have 2 options create a page with a width larger than height create a portrait page and rotate it disclaimer i work for the company that develops the xfinium.pdf library
instead of defining custom get and post routes is it better to use resource
you may want to look into swift which is much stricter about compile-time type safety than objective-c and is largely compatible with existing objective-c code on apple platforms
but don t use des it is not secure use aes it is no more difficult to use and is secure
that s horribly wordy so a couple examples within group 1 subgroup 1 is clearly less than subgroup 2 since max 2 3 min 4 6 7 . within group 2 subgroup 3 and 4 are not clearly less or more than the other since max 7 from subgroup 3 and 5 is not less than min 6 7 and max 6 7 is not less than 7
by the way i can t set fixed height for the image we only allow to set fixed width and let the height vary
my tabbar width is fixed in here so when i have long text in my tabbar it will not shown completetly i want to make my tabbar width is flexible base on the content so when my text is just short text the tabbar width will be small and when the text is long text the tabbar width be bigger than the short text tab
from the rich bradshaw s answer an implementation of a fadeout in jquery with a callback would be and of course .fadeout you can then use as normally the same can be done with fadein
in the expression the compiler is free to evaluate c+d before even though multiplication has higher precedence than addition
the result on the above matrix should be 5 7 3 3 6 8 4 3 6 8 4 4 6 6 2 2 i m trying to implement it in numpy but if it can be done in opencv or skimage please let me know
you should add a foreach-object to your pipeline two additional things i added to your code block above you used curly-braces where you should have used parentheses as evidenced in jacob s answer
auto access setting which means that visibility rules are to be used to automatically determine read- and or write-access of this property. read_only access setting that means that the property may only be read for serializable but not written set during deserialization. read_write access setting that means that the property will be accessed for both serializable writing out values as external representation and deserialization reading values from external representation regardless of visibility rules. write_only access setting that means that the property may only be written set for deserialization but will not be read get on serializable that is the value of the property is not included in serializable
the accepted answer works for me but with zsh shell terminal.integrated.shell.windows c msys64 usr bin zsh.exe things are much slower than with bash
isdigit should be passed a chars not an int
then endpoint i m writing should be accessed using post and not get
usually int can hold larger numbers than chars
i wonder if there is any way to do what the for-loop does any faster you have the chars arrays indata 4 0x30 0x30 0x3f 0x3f you want an int time 255 output indeed you can unroll loops to at the same time using potentially less expensive shift operations rather than pow
without parentheses is evaluated as because the multiplication has a higher precedence than the addition +
just check for the length of your value then if it is more than 0 hide everything and only show the s you have filtered with .filter
believe me i m a google-chrome fan-boy myself but firefox is better in this case. here are the reasons firefox uses its own ssl cache which is purged on shift-reload
i would suggest that you don t mix setlayout and setcentralwidget as this will lead to sometimes non-obvious issues with mouse and keyboard events
for setting config property based please take a look at this question node.js setting up environment specific configs to be used with everyauth in vsts release you could use environment scoped value per environment
csrf attacks can be performed over get or post requests
many similar procedure calls could be made to voltdb which would queue them to the partition where the relevant records are located and then execute them in a serializable sequence as fast as they can be executed often in small fractions of milliseconds because all the data is stored in main memory
actually the onclick prop expects a function you are already providing a function call so the setstate will be called each time the component is rendered not when clicked
if this is the case i would appreciate some direction to an article or content that explains why the request can be made server-side but not client-side
while searching on so i found out that it s not possible with get i have to take post
both is working but as you know the end of loops lastrow i think a for-loop is the better choice in this case
from documentation p pick use commit s squash use commit but meld into previous commit for example if you are looking to merge all the commits into one the pick is the first commit you made and all future ones placed below the first should be set to squash
then somewhere in your objective-c code the wrapper could be implemented thus the wrapper can then be used in swift code in fact the wrapper could be used in a swift extension of newkeychainmanager
i want to do center-cropping of the all volumes in a way that if width or height is less than 256 that dimension is padded with zeros
the easiest way to create that is using lapply as follows then if you want to create a single data.frame out of those you could use dplyr bind_rows migr2010 data.table rbindlist migr2010 or do.call rbind migr2010 although do.call is much slower than the other two

in the result if the image width is greater than height the height will be 500px and the width will be more than 500px but the extra part will be hidden vice-versa for if the height is greater than width
recall that the int type may have greater precision than double
i load a bitmap into the image view i read the bitmap from the file and then see if the width is bigger than the height
this can either be set using getter and setter or directly - and so on.
python 3.6 output i prefer lxml over elementtree because of better xpath support but elementtree is another option same output as above .
double s being floating point values and having a range larger than int s cannot guarantee no loss in data so c# requires an explicit conversion usually termed explicit cast via the explicit operator to indicate to the compiler that we re okay with losing data
parameters clientid - the client identifier with which this message is associated if any message - the message to be appended throws illegalstateexception - if this method is called after this instance has been released nullpointerexception - if message is null which of course raises the question what a non-associated message could mean is it displayed or not or queued somewhere - association is just a word with zero explanatory force in this context
and postgresql does a lot of things better than mysql
use indexof to find the starting position of the little string inside the big string you can then find the index of the character immediately following the little string by adding the little string s length to its starting position then use charat to pick out the character you should be prepared for the possibility that the big string does not contain the little string which would be indicated by indexof returning a result of -1
keep line-height less than height and width and u get perfect button. example line-height 12px
instead of localhost it is better to use lan local ip

i have a standard recycler view adapter i created but it has a strange issue where certain views will change their visibility or size randomly ok i say randomly it s obviously me changing the size and or visibility of these views so lets have a short example if i change the visibility at position 0 to gone based on my object having no text inside it when the adapter is called position 0 will indeed be gone but if i scroll down and back the view becomes visible a similar thing happens with my text views so if it has less than ten chars it should be size x and else should be size y on first load the size is correct but scrolling down and back the size changes i m aware that behind the scenes the view is loaded and recycled hence the name recycler view however i thought that the position passed into onbindviewholder final myviewholder holder final int position would always be correct as it comes from the main list if anyone can help me here i d appreciate it as right now i m scratching my head i m going to post my entire adapter class for the fear of not including enough but generally its my onbindviewholder that i feel is the main culprit which does include a lot of mostly arbritary code as mentioned everything works to a degree but i have strange errors when scrolling up and down with views changing i believe i m doing everything i should be everything displays the correct data just not always the right size or visiblity would appreciate any help a couple screenshots first the initial load second after scrolling up and down
swift - class method which must be overridden by subclassing this solution allows to inherited from a class and also to have the protocol s compile time check
i guess there is no solution so the answer mediarecorder android is buggy or mobile companies didn t care of all android features while developing their devices update mediacodec is also buggy with canvas it works on much more devices with mediacodec but still some devices may fail to record video correctly using this method so final answer don t ever use lockcanvas or lockhardwarecanvas when working with mediacodec or mediarecorder it s buggy
the primitive type chars is nothing different than and unsigned greater than zero int which can contain values from 0 to 65535
you could also try using caddy web server as a reverse proxy it is the simplest to manage that i ve come across and the config file is much simpler than apache or nginx

when data fit in memory pandas is faster than dask
for and on my laptop the dask version is faster than the pandas one
a faster convert function multiplication is always slower that sum and shift therefore change multiplying with shift
as ulrich eckhardt pointed out a better way to implement this is to use a for-loop it s more clear this way and the scope of ptr is limited to loops which is good because we don t need it later
yet another way to do it without the primary key would be using the json functions or pre 5.7.22 ordering or filtering can be done before grouping .
i assume the div is rendered before you get the data from the get and then post is still undefined. add to the div so it won t be rendered if post is undefined
at first we have to determine the number of parent both parent and children can be numbered starting with 0 and then a child can be assigned to parent x with this will produce an even assignment

you have to replace the touchesbegan with a tapgesture or replace the uilongpressgesturerecognizer with touchesended but is more precise the first option
angular doesn t offer such pipes because they perform poorly and prevent aggressive minification ... the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself this means you should get rid of your pipe and put the logic directly inside your component
but building a network and debugging it in tensorflow is more time consuming than keras
in firefox it is even worse because in firefox 52.9.0 for some reason the first column is as wide as the image before rescaling even though the image shrinks to to row height and keeps the aspect ratio thus its display width is lower

it is a reported bug on npm which versioning above 6.0.0 do not support node versioning under node 6.0.0. if you run node -v there is a strong suspicion that your node versioning is older than node 6.0.0 i ran in the same difficulties by innocently upgrading npm from versioning 2.14.20 to the latest stable versioning with nodejs on v4.4.0. problem is that you cannot just upgrade node since as you mentionned npm is totally blocked
i m not 100 certain but i m fairly sure this has to do with the fact that your variable operater is an int but you re assigning a chars to it this works - chars can be assigned to int and then comparing it back to the int eg doing so to fix it either use the chars in your switch or assign the int 1 2 3 4 rather than the chars 1 2 3 4
after some researches it seems to be linked to lapack which is no longer used by opencv but still by armadillo

this issue is particularly problematic in situations where a linq query is used such as points.distinct as the resulting points may be considered equals if comparing directly such as personally i believe the best option would be to change equals as follows such that it s behaviour is consistent with gethashcode however as this is already heavily utilised within an application this would be a significant breaking change
i believe it is the wrong thing to do but i m considering changing gethashcode to my understanding is that the above would force the equals method to be utilised which would result in a performance hit but also allow for points within a tolerance to be considered equals within linq queries
according to the aws article tutorial subscribing an amazon sqs queue to an amazon sns topic see the following note amazon sns isn t currently compatible with fifo queue

in recent releases of virtual box we can also automatically mount shared folder on creation see the image in the answer provided by the_ousek after a reboot of the guest this shared folder will be mounted to the guest directory media sf_ accessible to all users who had been made member of the group vboxsf
so it is necessary to have knowledge about wow64 implementation details file system redirector registry keys affected by wow64 and it is also advisable in general to have knowledge about application registration on windows
1 - make sure pyinstaller is installed in your anaconda pip install pyinstaller 2 - move to the directory of your python script cd c users.... program.py 3 - just type the following pyinstaller --onefile program.py if everything goes well in the folder where you have your script.py you it will be created many folder and your executable is inside folder dist
when training a neural network with some toy data the resulting training curves are very different between tensorflow and keras and i do not understand why
within such a plist you can use various triggers when the daemons shall be started by launchd when your application tries to connect to a specific ipc unix socket
one thing you could do is find the connected components and remove the ones that are small you can do the labeling with opencv as well with connectedcomponentswithstats or something like that but i m more familiar with skimage
tensorflow uses no initializer on the other hand keras uses xavier initializer
maybe correct your configure to get this and be carefull to put this before your usemvc
i prefer coalesce over nvl simply because coalesce is ansi iso standard
in case auto rotate is off you do nothing so the orientation will be block in portrait or in landscape depending if the user pressed the full screen button or not
first the data which gives us id value 0 1 3 1 2 20 2 3 21 3 1 6 4 2 24 5 3 7 6 1 21 7 2 8 8 3 50 then use a grouping filtering pattern to retain only the grouping where the min value in the grouping is greater than or equal to 5 and the max value in the grouping is less than or equal to 25
the goal is to get to i am sure this can be done with dplyr and lubridate but have ot been able to accomplish it
for reconstruction do something like note casting msb to unsigned here is necessary as otherwise it would be promoted to int int can represent all values of an unsigned chars which could overflow when shifting by 8 places
you can declare several constraints like that to automatically respect different constraints like making sure your button height is always taller than 36pt width is never wider than 400pt etc
this dropped my bad dates probably could have found min max dates before altering then selected anything smaller or larger then those after switching to varchar to find most issues not necessarily all though but i was not concerned with data loss on this table
i got a etherdelta-like decentralized exchange script and decided to install it on cpanel as i am not very familiar with linux commandline as the installation instruction is done with ubuntu commandline
this code snippet will do the work for those who are not familiar with concatmap it is a flatmap that doesn t allow interleaving of emissions
it seems wrong to recommend using flac or wav and having a 180 minutes of length in audio limit if the server can t even handle my hour long audio file that has been encoded to amr_wb
so since the rendered height is less than 53.167px the width will be as well
i m not familiar with objective-c following is my swift definition http status enum in swift 4 based on httpstatusenum.strings
so i m relatively farmiliar with linux been using it for a few years now and recently i ve been toying around with freebsd and dragonfly bsd
this will put this include in the bison generated file s before the definition of yystype the union doing this with generic yacc is harder -- you can use the

currently i have 3 arrays i would like to merge all the arrays into one object instead and i tried using for-loop but got an error instead the end result i want to achieve
any packet larger than the mtu including ip and udp overhead will be fragmented to multiple layer-2 packets
you may also take a look at background-clip or mix-blend-mode for infos to switch from a color to another a gradient image background-size can be moved via background-position and transition
a for-loop is not a code block by definition however and therefore the local variable defined in your for-loop is still visible after loops within the same module
not an option for me to write my own console so i ll just stick with mocha sinon for now
if you bytes s value is greater then 127 it might be modified by encoder decoder
playing with different range showed me that the linear strategy gets to be sane with range between 0 and ushort.maxvalue with a reasonable minimum value of 10.78294704 for ulong range the minimum value was 3.03518e+15
the java controller method you have written is of type get it should be changed to post as the ajax call you are making is also of type post try this and it will work
looking at that last line if max is less than min then min prevails
the way that this key exchange current works is client generates rsa public private key pair client sends out his rsa public key to the server server generates and encrypts aes key with client s rsa public key server sends encrypted aes key to client both parties now have the correct aes key and all messages can be encrypted using aes however every time i get to step three i am unable to encrypt the generated aes key with the client s rsa public key because i get this error as a result i am unable to complete the aes key exchange that i m trying to do
first check out this hortonworks guide some personal notes bare minimum depending on replication factor of 3 you need about 50tb 10x3 30tb 80 rule 40tb usable this give you 8tb to work with - so 5 nodes at 10tb a piece for hdfs hdfs can only use a maximum of 80 of total cluster space more nodes faster yarn jobs hive pig can read compressed data as if it was uncompressed i d personally start with 5 nodes 3 for a zookeeper quorum and 2 can be assigned namenode all of them can be set to datanodes don t forget about an ambari server and make this a vm...you ll need backups and snapshots daily upgrades updates can blow stuff up always have a plan if a job fails sometimes the most basic install doesn t go as planned
items you will need an ssl certificate for your domain available for free from letsencrypt.org a web server on the pi since motion doesn t use any installed webserver but instead has its own inbuilt one - i d recommend nginx or apache certbot to generate install the certificate on the pi configure the web server to be a reverse proxy and serve the http motion website as https using your ssl certificate secure the website both apache and nginx support http basic authentication which if the reverse proxy is configured correctly will be served over https so encrypted which is better than unencrypted base64 encoded and easily decoded credential info transmitted in the clear for all to see intercept
i guess the version of my wireshark is lower than the pyshark requirement
for a start all of your swift classes and any properties or functions you need will have to be exposed to objective-c
edit note that web.xml is the standard configuration file for war files web applications and it will be ignored inside jar files libraries
caveats include that the beans cannot be injected as factory-method parameters although with a bit of work you might able to fix this and that aop proxying will not be applied to these methods within configuration classes realrepository should never be called as it will not reference the singleton inner bean -- instead the instance field should always be referenced
you want to filtering the records so think where not grouping by in most databases this will have better performance than a grouping by if you have an index on document_history doc_id created_date
this corresponds to multiplying a column vector to the transpose matrix from the right thus multiplying a vector from the left to a matrix corresponds to multiplying it from the right to the transpose matrix this means if a matrix is defined like this and the matrix uniform mat4 transformation is set like this see gluniformmatrix4fv then that the vector has to be multiplied to the matrix from the right but of course the matrix can be set up transpose or can be transposet when set to the uniform variable then that the vector has to be multiplied to the matrix from the left note that the glm api documentation refers to the opengl shading language specification 4.20
gaussian elimination with row interchanges is used to factors a as a p l u where p is a permutation matrix l is unit lower triangular and u is upper triangular
so d has to be converted from double to int

you can t control browser but you can control another page in your website to have fixed height and width in a new pop up browser control
we have observed metrics time taken for render grid in firefox is more compare to google-chrome
i know about the one where the width is set and you use top bottom padding to maintain a certain aspect ratio like so but in my case i need the height to be set and width to be variable
i m using matplotlib version of violinplot instead of seaborn s because the former returns a dictionary with the various artists that were produced although the same could be done with seaborn with a bit more effort to locate the proper collection object
the main difference between the two is restlets can be used with get post put delete requests this makes it ideal if you are building and api which you can use in another application
suitelets can be used with get post
there are surely many ways to achieve this but the easiest would be repeated division by 10 another way would be modular arithmetic taking the index modulo 10
as detailed in documentation here the 1 cpu in is equivalent to 1 aws vcpu 1 gcp core 1 azure vcore 1 hyperthread on a bare-metal intel processors with hyperthreading so you can request a core using cpu 1 or cpu 1000m but if you want to be more precise - you can allocate like 250m of a cpu cpu 250m lastly if you need more than one cpu you could do cpu 2
gradle sync works completely fine with versioning 1.2.51 but as soon as i upgrade to versioning 1.2.60 which released recently gradle sync fails with the following error message could not find method kapt for arguments build_9jdgbsb8xiz9dkrq42qtcg5eg _run_closure1 _closure6 576656b5 on object of type com.android.build.gradle.libraryextension
need working example in 2.xx version what should be used war or jar
so if you really want to remove the values one by one like in your current algorithm you should store the current bounds but of course you do not need to work by increments and you could directly set the right min max bounds using integer division and of course but i don t know what is the context of your question you do not need to define a new constraint you can just use the predefined modulo expressions in the model that is posting at the concert level
however in some cases where i m writing tests i do keyword packing unpacking and in these cases dictionary is much more maintainable as i don t need to change to a 1 b 2 it also helps in some circumstances where i think i might want to turn it into a namedtuple or class instance at a later time
similar stuff can be done with vis.js node.js neo4j arangodb but as i see python libraries for that like seaborn plotly bokeh their graphs are not interactive
chars can be represented with int in consequence you would be able to concatenate those int and generate an int that represents the whole string
you need to change height and add change layout_gravity to gravity like the code bellow it probably will solve your problems if you want to improve your code i suggest you not to set fixed width and height it cand bring you problems in some devices
for example multiplication is of higher precedence than addition so 2 + 3 x 4 is equivalent to 2 + 3 x 4 not 2 + 3 x 4
visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero
so you can also access them through array0 as single array of 10 values mainarray .long array0 array1 array2 array3 now if you want value 2 3 the value 8 you can t simply multiply row value 2 by column size like in the matrix16x16 example because rows don t have fixed length so you will instead calculate offset into mainarray first like i will use x86 at t syntax because i don t know y86 but you should be able to get the idea as they are basically the same instructions just y86 has more limited instruction set and you have more verbose and cryptic syntax with more prefix suffix parts of instruction name sorry for not using y86 but as i said i don t know it.
if user changes her his mind later clicking on the image will erase it. i am not sure of qtableview will support it functionality. if i am wrong with my assumption that it can be done with qtableview or qtablewidget i appreciate any guidance in the right direction
i could also have chosen ntfs filesystems type but i already have lots of those usb sticks around and wanted to try something different
in python indentation is how you specify code blocks so anything indented exactly one tab more than the for-loop will get run every time loops iterates
so while racket has a sicp language where sicp code should work racket s default language is not compatible with scheme
if you wonder why this kind of vectorization is useful it is because a loop written by a compiled-language is faster than a loop written in an interpreted-language
a better architecture might be when there is work to be done push it to an amazon sqs queue or store details in amazon s3 and push a message that points to amazon s3 create a cloudwatch alarm that triggers when the size of the queue is greater than zero the alarm can trigger a lambda function that starts the gpu node the gpu instance has software running that pull work from the sqs queue when there is no work remaining the gpu instance calls shutdown on the operating system
a problem that i m having is with command import this is all the commands are stored in a folder called lib in the root folder of prosser and inside it can have folder and files if a folder is in the lib dir it can t be named as folder anymore its name now is package but this doesn t care for now
for a given number m we can find out how many magical numbers are smaller than m add m a the count of numbers divisible by a that are smaller than m and m b the count of numbers divisible by b that are smaller than m subtract m lcm the count of numbers divisible by both a and b that are smaller than m to avoid double-counting them
because the original size of my image is that the height is much longer than the width
also interested in this question when specifying the target platform as anycpu32bit-preferred in which mode like x64 application x86 application wow64 the executable file will be executed on windows rt arm and on windows ia64
my current jooq-codegen-maven configuration maps all tinyint 1 fields to java s boolean values issue is that in some cases db contains columns marked as tinyint 3 which should not be treated as boolean but some real int
activiti community web platform but is not compatible with alfresco content services workflow engine
in my testing i have a test trait to provide spark context the problem is that i need to add an import in every test function i managed to reduce this to on per file by adding to the sparktesttrait the following and then in the constructor of the implements file import testimplicits._ however i would prefer to have these implicits imported to all classes implements sparktesttrait i can t have sparktesttrait extends sqlimplicits because the implements classes already extends an abstract class
look the code bellow to understand requirement above ad section will only be rendered not show hide when browser size will be greater than 1300px
i have a picker that access the photo video gallery but my problem is when the video is portrait the width and the height of the video comes inverted. i ve wrote a patch that check for the size of the video and when width is bigger than height then it rotates it
if min is strictly less than max then tabbing will cycle naturally until either the min or the max is reached
according to the c c++ standard using memcpy with overlapped memory is ub on the other hand memmove is potentially slower
int such as +2 can be converted to boolean where 0 means false and every non-zero int true
in my point of view your second case is a way more efficient as sorting out or filtering data in simple php will make your application much slower
but speed of google-chrome is slower than firefox too
but i am required to draw polygon inside div as well and polygon does not allow to specigy poins in percentages that is why i am required according to svg polygon points with percentage units support use viewbox but it creates repeating pattern if the width of my div is larger than height
because http is a text protocol with no concept of boolean or int everything must be stringified for boolean test this and in php or and in php good luck
by default dragging the table from the data sources window onto the designer surface generates a datagridviewcheckboxcolumn for isnegative like so an ordinary checkbox has the appearance property which can be set to button to make it look like a toggle button but a datagridviewcheckboxcolumn doesn t seem to have an equivalent property
unsigned division of 64-bit division by 32-bit divisor by repeated subtraction of divisor from dividend with remainder may be faster than regular division if the dividend is not expected to be much bigger than the divisor
everything is technically working but as the div begins to expand the paragraph causes the height to extend much quicker than the width in order to contain the text in the paragraph
it s real unfortunate that the json you retrieve via get can t be inserted via put without stripping all of this out first though
to make the imageview always scale to fit the screen in my case the key solution was to set the constraint for the width the longest size you might want to set it for height if your image is height is bigger than width of the imageview equal to 1 superview width
i would like to set up a subdomain on my virtual server with debian 9 and apache 2 which points to a directory at var www html test. ssl and let s encrypt is also enabled so the subdomain should be reached with https too
there are few problems with your code is not applicable to as double doesn t extend int
then you can loops over your dataset and put the data in each arrays or if you are more familiar with for-loop finally you can create an arrays as you pointed in your example and the result will be for more informations take a look at array.foreach array.push and for...of documentations edit as you pointed in your comment you can generate arrays dynamically creating an object like

when i use this on my style tag the font works just fine with firefox and google-chrome and edge but it s not working on ie so i seareched about it and it s looks like i have to use woff and eot in order to make it work with ie so i used this code but when i change my style to it s not working even on firefox
this can be done without any trigonometric or transcendental operations in each pass of the loop about 21.5 of points will be discarded but this should still end up faster than using sin and cos
while slower than hdfs object store in s3 is significantly cheaper and scalable triggering actions via lambda or another scheduler can actually happen faster than oozie launching a yarn job
your are comparing them as string so by alphabetical order 1xx is before 9xx you need to compare then as double or int so use comparator.comparing double valueof or int valueof
it uses the query api endpoint rather than the query_range api endpoint on prometheus which is more efficient if you only care about the end of your time range and don t want to pull in data that grafana is going to throw away again
unlike the grouping calculation that column can be indexed and filtering on efficiently -- at the cost of more effort when storing reviews
this will be smooth on google-chrome but not on safari
i read on sololearn that the method attribute of an input tag within a form can be set to get or post
for example if there is a pressable interface which represents everything that can be pressed button checkbox should implement it
the trick is to override hittest within uiwindow extension could be done on uiview level as well but it would have wider implications because uiview is ancestor of uiwindow and return touch handling object whenever you see touches emanating from uiremotekeyboardwindow
with verilog being closer to c syntax it might be easier to start there and i also prefer it over vhdl but let s not get into religious discussions i know that emacs and sigasi editors provide auto-format options for rtl languages but their format options are strict and i don t like the outcome hence i intend to make the formatting style configurable i ran into this work it might be useful to build on it if possible

for the comparison and retaining the assumption that chars is a narrower type than an int both arguments are converted to int with -5 and 251 therefore retained
hence both chars values get promoted to int first see integral promotion for full details
yes using a salt hash is hugely better than an unsalted one but sha is a much more secure hash than md5
also i m looking forward if there any better ways to do orm in swift currently the code does working with dynamic object creation but when comes with orm relation it really drove me nuts here just looking for ways to manage it in a easier and more manageable ways where currently it looks like there are not much functionalities to do meta programming a lot of other orm libs still using objective-c which is much more easier but boilerplate on dynamic instance creation or class inspection
so fix it with chgrp and chown as per the many answers posted about such things ok maybe just permissions will be enough so now i m stuck
i need this query to both work postgresql and mysql due to requirements or i will need two queries if one query can t achieve this postgresql query has more priority so far i ve tried to use .extra syntax but it didn t work so asking it here
it s certainly easier and safer than git-rebase it doesn t modify true history and it keeps the branch tree clean using amend is also a good choice if you are correcting the most recent commit but an errata commit may be a good choice for older commits
consider these statements 32-bit plugins are not compatible with 64bit executable 64bit plugins are not compatible with 32-bit executable either go with 32-bit executable notepad++.exe and 32-bit plugins or 64bit executable notepad++.exe and 64bit plugins note x86 is another term for 32-bit means the same thing in this context at least

although i would recommend against using inherited to hide properties in your dtos dtos are declarative models used to define your service contracts hiding their properties behind inherited makes it harder for anyone reading it to know exactly what each service accepts and returns
union can be replaced with union all in my suggestion as the second query already produces a distinct result and the result from the first query is also free of duplicates in the result of the second query because the o is always different
more info in this so post order in maven the same behavior as above can be achieved in maven by specifying higher priority jar in pom.xml above lower priority jar

it seems like this is currently not possible with mongodb dbref fields
the ion- prefixed directives ion-list ion-item etc are angular directives that let you have extended features swipe to delete reorder etc . link as mentioned here main difference is that ionic tags serves more functionalities and other than that
if you are interested take a look at other than that i d recommend using carthage or cocoapods
something like this then using it like so extending collection makes more sense in this case which gives more flexibility as the hide show could be used with arrayslices then
so i came up with this in this case if width is bigger than height i wanted the width to be 600px and if the height was bigger than the width i wanted the width to be 400px

my question is is there a a way to do this in either pandas or dask that is faster than the following sequence group by index outer join each group to itself to produce pairs dataframe.apply comparison function on each row of pairs for reference assume i have access to a good number of cores hundreds and about 200g of memory
another way would be to replace each for-loop with an sapply which is faster than for loops and doesn t require the use of expand.grid
and i ve found that you use input.mouseposition as the index to seek pixel in texture.you also should note that once they donnot match if the pixel coordinates are out of bounds larger than width height or small than 0 they will be clamped or repeated based on the texture s wrap mode
so you will get more information about scaling horizontal here in elasticsearch terms when you start two or more instances on es in same network with same cluster configs then they will connect to each other and create a distributed network.so if you add one more computer or node and started one es instance there and keep the cluster config same that node will automatically will get attached to the previous cluster and the data and the request load will be shared .when you make any request to es may be its a read or write request each request can be processed parallel and you get the speed according to the no of node and shards in them of each index
the nearly correct specifiers would be hhu for unsigned chars hu for unsigned short and u for unsigned int
if the height is greater than the viewport then it increases the width of the directive

this way when you will visit the relevant url your form will be instantiated in get request and than when you will submit it it will post back to your view where post data will be used to populate your driverform and if the form will be valid the new_driver will be saved to database
you can set the width and height of an iframe to configure how much of the website will be visible at one time but making the width and height smaller than the width and height of the embedded website will just cause scrollbars to appear so the user can scroll to see the whole website
there could be a few minor enhancements to be made such as multiplying by 0.5 instead of dividing by 2.0 as division is slower but the basic premise should hopefully help
implementation consider this 6x3 dataset example in which each row represents an input example and each column represents a feature for the example first we need to create a covariance matrix of the features of each input and that s why we set the parameter rowvar to false in the numpy.cov function so each column represents a variable then we find the inverse of the covariance matrix but before proceeding we should check -as mentioned above- if the matrix and its inverse are symmetric and positive definite we use for this cholesky decomposition algorithm fortunately it s already implemented in numpy.linalg.cholesky def is_pos_def a if np.allclose a a.t try np.linalg.cholesky a return true except np.linalg.linalgerror return false else return false next we find the mean m of the variables on each feature shall i say dimension and save them in an array like this note that i repeated each row just to avail of matrix subtraction as will be shown next
the aggregated logs in the elasticsearch cluster can be viewed using kibana
and then for displaying the metrics you can basically choose between grafana kibana and think influxdata has something as well
some people for some reason thing post is somehow more secure then get well it s not
i don t know the exact solution but binary stuff needs to be done in hex or something other than text
in these cases fractions units can be represented with integer registers short int long if a scaling factor is used
then you would have resulting in a somewhat nicer jstree with parent children the way you intended when you did your bookmark management
data can of course be delivered through get requests as well but typically for normal forms the correct method would be using post
they are supported in google-chrome and safari and as of aug 2018 are soon to be supported on firefox and edge

you may assume that no name will contain more than 30 chars when displayed in this format no department will contain more than 15 chars payroll numbers will contain at most 5 digits and all salaries will be int less than 100 000
there is no hard limit on the data size you can process however when your rdd resilient distributed dataset size exceeds the size of your ram then the data will be moved to disk
you could also go through serializable form deserialization which is also less risky and handles more situations the code there uses a slightly different format though so you ll probably have to adapt it
and since inline const combination can be replaced with constexpr as m.m noted in the comments you can achieve the same effect with just
yes there is a .net sdk for native service fabric applications which can be used for stateful or stateless as used in the service fabric monitoring tutorial

there are more secure versions of some of the functions available strtok_r and strtol also comes in an int version so you don t need to cast its return value to int called strtod if you are on a nix system it would be a good idea to run man function_name man strtok to get a better idea of the function prototype and what it does how it behaves etc
compilation will fail because is a double . for the above to work the values of input array have to be cast to int after being truncated or rounded off
it s a simple drawer with standard actionbar classic detail with image going under the translucent status bar supposed to use collapsingtoolbarlayout to turn into a standard actionbar when scrolling up in this case it is non-standard actionbar i d call it a floating toolbar cause it doesn t expand to the full with of the screen and contains an already expanded searchview edittext fairly standard appbar with tabs list of issues that arise from leaving the single activity can t share viewmodel s between activities complex navigations which re-use parts already defined in another activity navigation graph have to be duplicated moved into a dedicated activity back navigation re-construction doesn t work between activities those are issues i want to avoid if possible but how do you guys manage these kind of situation on a single-activity with navigation component
page 5-1 states that the fields of a transient object must never be stored in persistent memory
it is also reasonable to expect the experts who wrote and tuned your c library to have implemented fgets more efficiently than you can reasonably expect to match by rolling your own with getchar
i know someone will have a good suggestion for something cleaner than the sorting looping and filtering i ve tried
this would be good start for you spring serving web content with spring mvc once you have a backend service created your frontend will call the service as a rest endpoint values will be passed as get or post request with the request to this backend service

because a double is typically larger than an int and because the struct is packed the field b is not properly aligned when the smaller field appears first
for example in your polygons there are 3 points p1 p2 p3 we calculate the distance between point p2 and the line |p1p3| if this distance is less than the given epsilon value p2 point is removed from polygons
so it is only down to choosing whether the int or long overload is more specific given that the actual parameter is a chars it is the int overload which is more specific because int is narrower than long
it s just that no effort is made to make them resistant to cryptographic analysis that could lead to constructed collisions . take a look at these pages which have extensive info on recent developments in general these hash are going to be slower than an ad-hoc xor implementation but much faster than cryptographic hash like sha and md5

i know there are a lot of solutions for a fixed header and i tried almost all of the examples but none of them worked out exactly how i wanted it to be. i am trying for four days now to create a table with followed specs the table should have a fixed header the table should have the class table table bordered from bootstrap the table is not of top of the web page there are some other elements above it the width sould be 100 the table should have 10 colums the columns should not be all the same distribution should be like this 10 |9 |8 |11 |8 |9 |8 |12 |20 |5 if something in this column is longer than this it should make a line break the table should have an height about 55vh if the table is longer than the height it should be scrollable if the browser window gets smaller the website replaces the elements because i use the grid system but the table should stay with the size it had before and a scollbar for the x-axsis should appear the columns from the table body should always be the same size like the columns from the table head i also tried different solutions with jquery but none of them worked like i wanted to
edited after some development and many bugs i finished with this elegant solution that i am sure apple would not be happy to approve but i do not know that works from ios 10 to ios 12 when the searchbar is in the tableheaderview the above code can be called in viewwillappear but if it is in the navigationitem on ios 11 and above it should be called in viewdidappear
i would like to recursively search through project directory for feedback report folder and if that folder has no more sub directory i would like to process the files in a particular manner
the first is easily fixed with an option the second can be fixed by using match.fun instead of get and the third can be mitigated with dplyr rowwise purrr pmap or base r s mapply
clojure s fold seems to be constrained to reductions with a monoid whereas scala s fold is closer to the general list catamorphism at the expense of parallelism
so you can create a list of the words and their prefixes output name value prefix app 3 app apple 2 app application 7 app bow 2 bow bra 6 bra brave 5 bra bravery 3 bra canes 4 canes caned 2 caned that data can then be summed and grouping by prefix output prefix sum value app 12 bow 2 bra 14 caned 2 canes 4 sqlfiddle demo note i took the liberty of sorting bow before bra
when a range of values is scanned to find the maximum we usually compare each element to a variable let s say max which holds the greater value found so far and which is updated when a bigger value is found
the tabcontrol contains more than 1 tabitem
redirection can be done on stderr standard error and stdout standard output but not the exit status
the problem is that you are working with strings if you compare two strings with it will only compare as many chars as it has to until it finds a chars that is smaller smaller being it s int representation than another here it will only compare 1 to 9 meaning chars code 49 to chars code 57

of course that can be done easily client-side using javascript in the following way jquery syntax however for various reasons linked with the real application i need to perform the computation server-side and show the result client-side after calling my api
if your web app is being hosted over https as you ve indicated then all external resources it is consuming cdn scripts css files api calls should also use ssl and be secured through https
also if you don t use sublimetext i recommend it over notepad++ atom-editor visual code and others because of proper threading implementations making it much much faster to use.
here is a simple program to list all files and directory in a folder it seems less complicated than your code. it should be easy to find out by looking at the dirent structure for each entry in the folder whether or not it is a directory and if so abort
so the reason why your form is sending a post even when you didn t set the method attribute is because you are using form collective else your form would have defaulted to get
by analogy with addeventlistener it is better to use rather than onload
myisam is slower than innodb in most cases and fails to support any acid properties
for example if i want to type this table character ascii tab 9 linefeed 10 carriage return 13 spaces 32 without using tabs i have to type spaces many times after the word tab not as many times after linefeed and only a few times after carriage return
however you need to keep an eye on jvm heap usage and garbage collection activity this can be done using jvisualvm as if you set too high heap which won t be really used by jmeter the jvm will spend much more time while doing the garbage collection and if there will be page file extensive usage your jmeter engine will not perform well as disk io is much slower than ram operations
a working example is run here it really depends on what you need to achieve and if your users are unique you should simply get a set rather than a list also if instead of string the info is contained in user object the order of users need not be changed by this and can be implemented to put users by id or name later
in the dialog we can choose to vary based on width landscape or height portrait which means that we can define a distinct set of constraints for the orientation that we have so far not utilized
so i elaborate this a little bit this is valid and can be used with struct for whom which are to lazy to type the struct always a typedef can help it might look confusing but the compiler separates struct tags and types in separate lists
for example the first user is connected to antenna 3 between 00 00 and 1 00am and antenna 5 between 1 00am and 2 00am so the value in a should be plus i used a for-loop to do this which gives user h01 h02 a 1 1 3 5 92 2 2 3 5 92 3 3 6 3 47 4 4 8 4 92 5 5 9 1 49 6 6 10 2 156 7 7 4 8 16 8 8 1 8 28 9 9 2 9 42 10 10 5 10 7 this loops works and gives the correct values the problem is the 2 datasets df1 and array1 are really big
this should be tested in mysql not postgresql select table_schema # db name round sum data_length + index_length 1024 1024 1 # db size in mb from information_schema.tables group by table_schema
there are a number of problems in your code power in fortran isn t but sind and cosd should be replaced by sin and cos as the later are standard functions and the versions with the d are extensions
so ive been designing a site where you see a table with persons and can filtering that table by searching for an expression and make your search more specific by filtering by grouping member guest etc. first name last name and company the person works for
bson to java data type mapping the int value can be converted to double in java
note that replacing elements of lists and double vectors is faster using rcpp while for int vectors base r solutions are preferred benchmark 1
i don t think the problem is shiny data.table may be a little faster than dplyr but i think the main issue here is to try to execute the query in postgres and avoid moving the data in memory
it means that compiler mandates that such exception-handling to be handled by try-catch block or throws keyword
i want to return null. if it does i want to select max date where editing_type zajem that is smaller than min date where editing_type notranja kontrola the query i came up with the where val ko between 0 and 9999 part is only to check if the entry is valid

generally serverspec is used with chef via the test kitchen integration testing framework though these days inspec is more popular
two of the sub-selects were too slow as client-side queries in access so i created them as server-side views which worked better but still had room for improvement
in your case you have given flex-basis 300px and padding 10px so each box width will be since you didn t set box-sizing border-box padding will be included in width
i tried sending encoding in http request s content encoding field but it doesn t seem to have any effect also in post request content encoding to be used for post put patch and file
if you want to use threads as your execution pool you can choose between eventlet an gevent
i am quite free in terms of the type of the interpolation but it shouldn t be too fancy nothing crazier than a splines or a low order polynomial
typically declarative code is better then imperative code
what you want is called proxying and can be achieved via nginx or apache
for code changes i recommend using packer to build ami s as a part of your ci pipeline it can definitely be cumbersome to manage launch config changes with terraform and asg s given how buggy it can be but i think the result is much cleaner and safer than updating code with ansible
both of them can be used to show hide columns on device size
same concept can be used to hide show columns
however a better way to deal with that is arguably to use -format strings in the log calls for example logging.debug starting s self.name finally the line super .__init__ could be changed to super device self .__init__ all other things being equal your code looks cross-compat now
i m somewhat familiar with printwriter and bufferedwriter etc but i m not sure what to do when i want to print out results that exist on the console such as below where the questions are system.out.print and the digits 3 18 19 are user input
if it is rejected with a redux-form submissionerror containing errors in the form field1 error field2 error then the submission errors will be added to each field to the error prop just like async validation errors are
i know that there are similar algorithms like floodfill watershed and distancetransform implemented in opencv scipy and skimage that are really fast but don t give me the path i want
so you can effectively use or but a really fast way in you case could be as strpos is stated to be less consuming and more faster than strstr and also because you use all the same substr

i know strncpy is a safer version of strcpy as said here
so an alternative is to simply convert to from json object before and after transformation - and of course this could be done in xquery which might be preferable before running the xslt
have tried returning boolean int string values and adapting - nothing with each variant
this appears because chars evaluation like that you have above is done by comparing the code points which also is why chars types can be treated as int
in general if you want something to occur at a set interval setinterval is a better alternative to settimeout
this is for django but i m sure it could be adapted for flask

the compiler isn t allowed by the standard to do the conversion to for you the ellipsis notation in the declaration of printf means that default argument promotions occur but that affects only the float type and int types smaller than int short chars etc
i m facing weirdly inconsistent rendering between webkit and gecko
well in other programming languages like c the int would be converted into chars or chars and would undergo operation 2.
as of sep18 also have a look on quart apistar as of mar19 add fastapi looks very promising nota bottle is lighter faster than flask but with less bells whistles falcon is fast
well in other programming languages like c the int would be converted into chars or chars and would undergo operation 2.
ch must have type int instead of chars for the test to behave correctly
i need to create a very simple design a card image + title + some text a button simple button that is fixed in the bottom of any screen now requirement is to make sure it renders great on most popular modern devices iphone ipad androids but also if opened on pc this is what i did so far it sort of works but a i can not resolve the following on mobile devices where width is smaller than height - the card is too small i need it to be spreaded around a bit more so that it tried to occupy most of the space but was still always centered both vertically and horizontally
this is the same situation for a linked list or for any data structure where there is a notion of next but not a notion of size instead there is some sentinel value that marks the end nul -terminated strings in c or a way to check whether there is a next element iterator in java there are also situations that can be handled with a for-loop but a while loops is more elegant
a for-loop for this will then typically look like this in order to skip the iterations from the actual number of iterations up to the upper bound which would much better be expressed as while not terminationconditionreached dosomethinginteresting end using the for-loop could make sense in this situation if the value of i is of interest a last situation i can think of where a while loops is more appropriate than a for-loop even though the number of iterations is bounded by a known constant is if that constant is not semantically interesting for loops
however i would still like to find an example for that which is not also an example of a semantically un-interesting termination condition. so we have two classes of situations here one where a for-loop simply cannot be used when the bound is unknown non-existant or infinite and one where a for-loop can be used but a while loops is more intention-revealing
most of them will be created with matplotlib within a loop but i would need also to include pandas plots and dataframes the whole view and seaborn plots
since int are wider than chars an int containing the value a typically contains one byte with the value a and one or more bytes with the value zero

recently i had the same issue using jackson-annotation 2.9.0 and lombok 1.18.2 this is what worked for me so basically adding the annotation means that the property may only be written for deserialization using setter but will not be read on serializable using getter
first of all using a for-loop is better than using a while loops here now to answer your question you can use random.choice to exclude range j - 5 j + 5 if you only want to use randint an alternative is to use a while loops to keep rerolling value k until it does not fall in the j +- 5 range as shadowranger points out the while loops strategy is less computational demanding and is easier to read so you might want to go for that
as ekscrypto in swift 4 or later all functions need objective-c if you use less versión than swift 4 is enoguh objective-c in class
you have to add the extra data with name and value indexes where name holds the name of the variable to be posted and value is the value of the variable you want to append but before i suggest the actual code you have a few things to look after you cannot name a variable containing - like you have declared hyphens can be mistaken as subtraction attempts
the query should be converted from int to boolean here is the code
geojson is much simpler than shapefile kml or gml and it used widely on webgis.we can easily conveter shapefile to it with geotools
will work as long as all your users are on the planet after making all the calculations use an array sorting method to find the x closest nodes to each node and there you have it you may or may not want to prevent a user being grouping on more than one grouping but that s just business logic actual code would be a little too much to provide at this time without seeing some of your progress first but this is basically what you need to do algoritmically
this should set the default type for all columns as chars while time would be parsed as int
then you can use dynamodb streams with a lambda that looks at each update and checks if latest is less than min or greater than max
prints 9 this is because d means print int value and any int with size less than int like a chars is promoted aka converted to int when calling printf
for your current problem i recommend using uistackview horizontal with distribution set to fillequally and if items exceed screen width embed it inside a uiscrollview or use a uicollectionview instead
in your second you also have three other characters which will be treated as delimiter so the words are humans cats and dogs if you really wanted to process a spaces delimiter list of quoted strings then tell scan to use blank as the delimiter and add the q modifier to allow quoted strings
but if i invoke the to_csv method then dask is as slow as pandas
we have two problems here some of the udp packages are being dropped at some network hops because they are bigger than their mtu when a service get a number of commands to announce bigger than the max datagram size it will not be able to work with the rest isolated forever... because of what i have wrote above i am going to port the network layer of swim-js to use tcp which allows reliable communication
to give some further clarification i ve included the diagram presented in the node.js documentation these phases can be read about in much more detail at in short summary timers scheduled callbacks and anything set on timers will execute here such as setinterval or settimeout
similar can be applied to add and subtract methods in the 1st code snippet and you can apply modifiers there
1 protocol gcloud introduced new health checks which can be configured for https ssl tcp ssl http https or http 2 probing
dr you run two ajax calls in this case the get response is faster fewer data to precede probably or some other case than the post request so you ll get the outdated data at the first time
object returned by this method will be passed as props to your component and if you define your selector inside this object it will be redefined each time your component receives a prop
the normal output will be found in stdout and all errors in stderr
the tricky part is the parent active mode and passive mode can be shuffled so the active mode would be after passive mode the children local eu and international ww can also be shuffled a parent might be missing or a child might be missing so there is a chance that there is no active mode which means i should get something like none one possible solution i thought of was to somehow convert the flat string into a multi-layer dictionary list or json but i don t know how am i suppose to do it
put another way everything we do in http could be done with post - what the other methods do is allow us to unlock optimizations in generic consumers observers of the messages
i am on windows 10 and have installed linux ubuntu directly from the store using the guidelines given here i also have xming and have set display 0 in my bashrc file. programs such as firefox and pycharm run just fine but vscode does not run. it s not the same as this issue and the produced error messages seem different
i have a post module and i already tested with the post method in the loopback explorer and it worked the loopback is sending the data to firebase but when i enable the rules for only authenticated users to be allowed to post i can login and set the token but when i try to execute the post method in the post module i get the 401 message from unauthenticated user
i need to change form submission action url which is depends on onchange of values of 2 select inputes.form should be submited onclick of button

looking into plugin for jmeter discussion at the newrelic forum the nr support guy mentions there is a blazemeter integration with newrelic which you can consider given blazemeter is 100 jmeter-compatible hence you should be able to run your tests via their cloud
the code also sets a fixed height while you want a dynamic one as bootstrap does not provide fixed width containers
if your parent component and child copmonent exists strong relationship like child component must be placed inside parent component probably you d like to try vue provide inject parent component provides one method to allow the children to register their tracks then uses provide to pass it below demo pass the instance by this keyword to the children
be also very careful with printf strcpy strcat .
you can find information about required libraries inside pom.xml it is much easier to use tools like maven to build java applications
these are the stackoverflow links - is custom kibana plugin installation in aws elasticsearch possible kibana read only dashboard how to block selected kibana subpages using nginx kibana dashboard only mode another approach is given at this link applying read only permission to kibana dashboard but this would lock the .kibana index and it would be a problem for other users using it
i m pretty sure you guys aren t experiencing any errors the adding of n does nothing more than fflush your printing buffer and make it in fact a visible indication within your stdout or a terminal for this matter
you re probably loading all of the data in your ram thus allocating all memory available forcing your system to rely on swap memory writing temporary data to the disk which is much slower
i might be late to the party but easy and fast solution without or minimal downtime could be aws database-migration-service which can be used to upgrade your database to a different versioning as well as to some other server or rds
swift 4.1 xcode 9.4.1 1 swift enum must be prefixed with objective-c and be int type 2 objective-c name is enum name + case name eg calendarpermissionauthorized and of course remember to import your swift bridging header as the last item in the objective-c file s import list #import myappviewcontroller.h #import myapp-swift.h
an example of what s possible in postgresql 11 but not mysql 8 is this with t v as values 1 1 3 5 5 5 6 select v array_agg v over o groups between 1 preceding and 1 following exclude current row as current array_agg v over o groups between 1 preceding and 1 following exclude group as group array_agg v over o groups between 1 preceding and 1 following exclude ties as ties array_agg v over o groups between 1 preceding and 1 following exclude no others as no_others from t window o as order by v yielding i ve blogged about these postgresql features more in detail here
in other words just like is treated as because multiplication has higher precedence than addition the precedence of that example code works like this so f# processes this as which becomes
after all you could do this insert into accounts user salt password values myuser 1234 sha2 concat xyzzy 1234 256 but now you the password xyzzy appears in plain-text in your query logs and binary logs even if it is stored in hash form in the table itself
i believe the issue at hand is my bad implementation of one of the 3 resources which either cause the foregroundservice to get killed the alarmmanager to get cleared or the wakelock to not aquire
let s assume we have the following objective-c class now if no nullability annotations are specified either explicitly or via ns_assume_nonnull_begin ns_assume_nonnull_end then the name property will be imported in swift as string
currently i use v.2.x sdk written in objective-c and need to update it to v.3.x which is written in swift and cannot be imported into objective-c project as it is using swift-specific features
project dependencies such as static archives that were built against libstdc++ will also need to be rebuilt against libc++
2 but if i open a multi-module maven project the debugger cannot start because of java.lang.classnotfoundexception org.springframework.boot.web.servlet.support.springbootservletinitializer 3 the project can be built with maven and running the jar is all right i guess the problem is because of the classpath settings however to my understanding the .classpath file should be derived from the pom.xml file which should be correct otherwise maven would have not been able to build the project
finally your while loops really only counts and so a for-loop is more appropriate
i would recommend using mouseenter and mouseleave instead
that is you could use to give but for the more interesting case of images like you mention at the end of your question then the axes probably won t be integer multiples and you ll be better served by a splines or other type interpolation
case sql server uses the following precedence order for data types user-defined data types highest sql_variant xml datetimeoffset datetime2 datetime smalldatetime date time float real decimal money smallmoney bigint int smallint tinyint bit ntext text image timestamp uniqueidentifier nvarchar including nvarchar max nchar varchar including varchar max chars varbinary including varbinary max binary lowest data type precedence so this expression has data type of datetime since datetime has a higher precedence than int
it has to be created with loops such as a for-loop and if statements
i assume that the form will be sent using post so you can get the data create hidden type inputs and assign them the corresponding data values attach these inputs to the form send the form please consider this example having this set of forms given this logic i hope it is useful for you

but height is smaller for 300px width image and larger for 600px width images
as it is commonly implemented smalltalk is focused on messages being sent to methods making decisions at runtime and common lisp is more focused on macros calling non-generic functions making many but not all decisions at compile-time. these are fundamental design and implementation decisions but there s no reason you couldn t create a lisp that had a more smalltalky feel by utilizing clos and deferring more decisions to runtime
for instance if wanted to write something like bivariategraphics iris_data petalwidth sepalwidth the second and third arguments would be construed as height and width not x and y
if you have specific time frames you want people to insert this can be added by min and max
i would have preferred to have injected an idictionary but because of the limitation with injecting ienumerable into the constructor this limitation is unity specific i came up with a little workaround
i m guessing png type cairo takes longer than xlib because it produces antialiased output
the for-loop does not execute the command goto if the user entered string consists only of digits as in this case nothing can be assigned to loops variable i
that would extremely white-box and expects far more than the functional spec. question currently my conclusion is that i can not utilize the .received instead i must install callbacks for all the 4 overloads and set a variable inside them and in the assertions part i examine that variable
to check a checkbox radio button value you can use checkbox.checked where checkbox is your dom object selected by queryselector
so as per the recommendation it should not be returned in the response of put request and a subsequent get call should be made to get the status of the emails
which also allows to simplify the component and make it a stateless function one thing to keep in mind alertplace function prop will be recreated each time state.geography.place changes so if the connected stateful component was something complex you would like to avoid re-rendering too often not in this case with a simple button further changes are needed
to clarify all browsers under ios will be reported as safari webkit all browsers under android but firefox will be reported as google-chrome blink google-chrome opera blisk vivaldi etc
i ve currently set up a client-side test in javascript but it needs to be shifted server-side for security reasons. i m struggling finding a simple way to do this
just use apiversion v1 kind endpoints metadata name external-server subsets - addresses - ip aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd - ip aaa.bbb.ccc.eee - ip aaa.bbb.ccc.fff ports - name metrics port 9100 protocol tcp and a new target with several endpoints will be added to prometheus targets .
this was an earlier versioning of node that i didn t want to use so the solution for me was to either remove the local node.exe so the one listed in would be used or upgrade the local node.exe file if the node.exe.config is really needed
the property can be accessed via name using getattr the property can be set using setattr
filtering and concat since you don t care about the order other than these two grouping and you know the larger array has all the elements from the smaller rather than sorting you could just filtering all critarray items out of array than concatenate critarray and array this assumes _id is a unique identifier
i know that jersey uses hk2 as default di and because hk2 is performance loss the alternative di is guice which is better we need to configure jersey to use guice using guice-hk2-bridge
the width is fine but one of them is shaped like a square and the height is longer while the other is rectangle and the height is shorter and i know its because of the way video was taken one was taken vertically and the other horizontally
it is highly probable that representing small maps by an array of pairs of int double is more efficient both in terms of memory and in terms of cpu time
if i have not misunderstood since my nodes depend on my message assemblies when i upgrade one node i also have to upgrade their dependencies to the same major versioning so that i ll be forced to upgrade my message assemblies too
to check by doing would require you to implement your arrays as below and it will look for keys that are identical to your search or if you want to search for a word in the keys of an associative arrays or with a foreach however doing it with a for-loop is faster and more optimized
go to an android v7.0 tablet acer b3-a40 and the same changes can be realized on firefox but google-chrome fails
i tried both using comparison and custom icomparer with comparison with custome icomparer both custom comparator and comparison have same logic code but i was suprised that the performance of sorting by comparison is better than comparator
i m getting the error that there cannot be converted from double to int
and one final note the site with the embed play button code must be accessed with ssl so via https
how can i make the program randomly choose difficulty between min and max difficulty
in fact it s probably not being sent at all and instead buffered inside of stdout but that could be fixed with fflush stdout after printf
that leaves the objective-c interface unchanged but the function can be called from swift as oclass.classinit if no modification of the objective-c header file is possible then you can still call the function from swift as my3rdpartyclass.init as void the void return type resolves the ambiguity
you get an even more efficient query this query adds a convenient hyperlink to the user id. note that just the top 10 users have more than 50k post
i can have a post on auth that needs to be redirected to get login
i don t want this enum to be considered during serializable or deserialization
to parse a string i used this but during compilation this error appears caused by the lexer.lex above error this expression has type sedlexing.lexbuf - parser.token but an expression was expected of type lexing.lexbuf - parser.token type sedlexing.lexbuf is not compatible with type lexing.lexbuf from my understanding this error appears because ocamlyacc expects the lexer to be generated by ocamllex and not by sedlex
-webkit- - would be support browsers such as safari or google-chrome -moz- - would be supported by firefox -o- - would be supported by opera -ms- - would be supported by internet explorer browsers
i m making a webextension for google-chrome and firefox that adds more information to github
an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of it though it may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screen. the default value for this actually varies between some versions so it s better if you explicitly declare this attribute at all times
scala curry also makes it easier to pass around a function as a first-class
a workaround for now would be to choose a range max - min that is a power of two but is larger than the range you want and then modify your component to either add a large penalty for a minimization problem to the objective value f when you are outside the desired range or raise an analysiserror can be imported from openmndao.api when you are outside the desired range
i was also facing the same issue the possible solution is to install the gulp-sass module but if you will run the below command npm install -g gulp-sass or npm install --save gulp-sass this is not going to be updated on node-sass project s end
you can check it in this answer in my scenario i am checking the error code if it is -999 then i just return from a function like following note unlike nserror of objective-c code property is not available with swift error
since some items may be deleted from listbox1 the counter1 needs to step from the max to min to avoid any array index issues from the counter becoming greater than the max index
note while it would be nice to allow all screens sizes for this application it is not currently possible for devices smaller than a tablet to have a usable experience
http_build_query params if the request is using get but the accesstoken api must be requested as post request not get so make sure your curl call sends a post request see the second error is related to the first one because the access token is empty you get a http 400 error bad request
this is a shorthand rule that breaks down to flex-grow 1 flex-shrink 1 flex-basis 0 source 2019 update since the posting of this answer in 2018 it appears that google-chrome s behavior has changed and is now uniform with firefox and edge
or on x86 with sse4.1 for 16-bit integer elements phminposuw _mm_minpos_epu16 can be used for min or max signed or unsigned with appropriate tweaks to the input
as mantissa for the double in such a case has less bits than the int then double is able to represent less digits and a loss of precision happens
if we re talking about a safari app extension and not a legacy safari extension deprecated in safari v12 then my understanding is that the background script needs to be rewritten in swift. regarding the content scripts they are still in js but all the messaging written with google-chrome api calls must be rewritten using safari app apis
matplotlib has many more color maps but it is not straightforward to apply these colormap to given opencv images
however imagesrc is not an arrays so it does not have element 0 you need to have an else statement if not so the code after the if is always executed moreover image1 imagesrc is overriding image1 whole content anyway this code should work if you want a default value for imgsrc instead you need to get it before loops array_column is not intended to be used in for-loop here you can check the manual an example using array_column edit obviously if you have more than one variants and you want them all you need a foreach on variants
we tested the same device with skype wich also goes over the call channel and the sound on skype is alot louder than our own application and google hangout or even a normal telephone call
i have some data on hdfs that i am trying to setup to be queried via hive
but currently there were some changes in the implementation and the put response need to be changed to post response for new object creation and remains as it is when updating it
if ordering of output column should be swapped - first f and then m columns explanation first rename columns by dictionary then set_index by counter series created by cumcount with added 1 and converted to strings reshape by unstack soer second level of multiindex by sort_index flatten multiindex columns by map and join last reset_index for column from index if ordering of output columns is important is possible use double rename of columns
it took me a while to understand that this is according to documentation requires that a b and clearly is larger than max since lowest is negative unlike min
update i am a little bit closer after trying out this code i get the correct data for the first day but for the second day i get all zeros the third day the max is lower than the min and so on
you could use an hadoop platform to build a data warehouse by using mapreduce to process data and load it into orc files that will be stored in hdfs and that can be queried by hive
the i cannot be converted to double and the d cannot be converted to int
code allocates insufficient memory when int is wider than chars - something that is very common
it has created a temp file though in the specified temp folder i have windows 10 32gb ram about half look free after the imagemagick command above is run inter core i7 cpu and disk has more that 200gb free
i ve come to swift from objective-c and there s a lot of things that objective-c can do but swift is much more complicated
if you define your column as char 8 then it will always be padded with spaces whether the value in the file has spaces or not if i make the file have a mix with varchar2 the column value will only have spaces if the file has trailing spaces so with the same file with a mix you get varying lengths in the table if you want the column values to not have trailing spaces even if the file values do you need to trim them off if they exist create table arranger_check matriid varchar2 8 organization external type oracle_loader default directory ext_tab_data access parameters records delimiter by newline fields matriid char 8 rtrim location file.csv reject limit unlimited
putting the advices together no include but select to fetch only the used data no tolist but as enumerable to fetch data per page instead of all data return ienumerable after all the data is in local memory ienumerable can do more than iqueryable
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0. element_to_be_clickable locator mentions class selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.element_to_be_clickable locator an expectation for checking an element is visible and enabled such that you can click it.
i know that this is a silly example but when you want to do more complicated stuff i thought that using tensorflow would be easier than keras functions as there are more functions available
a more sophisticated version of this trick would be to create an inheritable attached properties treeviewitemlevel that would be set to zero on the treeview and to one more than the inherited value on treeviewitem s
the problem is that the more paging to disk that is required the more you are going to degrade the performance of your applications since disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram access
follows is the basics we managed to get working posting without issues to kibana however we are finding it difficult to get class method and line number to print out in the jsonlayout so that it could be indexed by elasticsearch and hence searchable in kibana as a field
since ram access is faster than disk access storing and fetching data in redis is much faster than sql but the catch is ram has limited storage
my current thoughts are the following start the file generation as soon as the client opens a connection to on a specific route previously this would have been a post the background task gets started as soon as the client connects and get the channel name as a paramenter once it is done it sends back the file path to the consumer which in turn sends it to the browser where i ll use js to create a download button
if you want a loops that ends more naturally at the end of file it s recommended to use the file object as an iterator so you can use a for-loop to iterate over it instead
i have a feeling that i have probably not set the in my test properly to be used during post but i am not sure and really need help to get it right
i personally prefer to go with ionic 4 since the angular adaptation makes it easier for me to work around
i am building a program in c++ it is being build on windows using visual studio but as it will be used on linux and windows i tried to compile it on ubuntu using g++ but the compiler keeps giving me an error
indeed a + b is an int type since an unsigned short is a narrower type
as patrick haugh pointed out in the comments section you could explicitly set all of the attributes of enemy at construction if you update your method to be titled __init__ self name hp skills attack defense loot expget flvrtxt alternately if you intend to instantiate specific types of bush es and imp s you might want to create them as their own classes that sub-class the enemy class but have their own default implementations for their associated fields class bush enemy def __init__ self super bush self .__init__ bush 10 none 0 5 a stick 50 just a bush it cannot attack class imp enemy def __init__ self super imp self .__init__ imp 50 none 10 10 gold 150 cliche rpg enemy this way would allow you to write code like the following to instantiate a bush that would come pre-poulated with all of the fields that you define for a bush in its class
according to this 5 2 is widened to 10.0 and which is equal to 10.0 if you are comparing the mixed data types then the result will be considered on the basics of data type which is having long range so in your case float range is more then int float max number can be -- 1.7976931348623157e+308 int max number can be -- 9223372036854775807 thanks
the algorithm works as follows iterate each arrays element for-loop until main_array elements index is less than chunk arrays size a size
unlike most integer operations division throughput and latency on modern x86 cpus depends on the operand-size 64bit division is slower than 32-bit division
it looks like you only have two points left to make it work one the http method should be set to post instead of get since you want to send something
however i learn that all qobject should not be instantiated before qapplication instantiated.you can read qt document about qapplication s detailed description
using this would result in the following - notes as is used to rename the output columns without renaming the columns they would be named max sum_score and min sum_score respectively. sql as understood by sqlite - aggregate functions this utilises the sqlite aggregate functions max and min and the group by clause to aggregate the columns according to the _id column
for example using your logic with a slight change in variable names to make it clear whether you are operating on the least or most significant bits in an element you could do the following note you need to look carefully at your logic for determining cont_idx and test whether the number of bits you are replacing will span more than sizeof unsigned bytes effecting more than two elements or whether the bits to be replaced all fall within a single element -- that is left to you putting that in a short example using your test case you could do example use output
a convolution with a box kernel can be computed using the integral image where the output for one pixel can be computed by addition of 4 values plus one division no matter what the size of the box is
for example for strdup and strndup it s the returned pointer can be passed to free
in short each time posix says that a pointer can be passed to free or a pointer to memory allocated as if by using malloc it actually means you need to free that pointer if you want to avoid a memory leak
for the sake of simplicity let s consider that these elements are int we could have used boolean and forget about some of the aspects of dictionaries to only count the size used to store the keys and the values
1800 is the number of seconds for 30 minutes change it to whatever delay you need on the other hand you may be writing a script that will reboot your server and you may want to keep it from working if it is run before 30 minutes of uptime which makes more sense
my problem is the jenkins or the mvn release prepare my pom.xml not commited and my file was not uploaded to the nexus. mvn release prepare not committing changes to pom.xml but we get it now that my jenkins process uses a newer version of the maven-release-plugin to build my project
rsa is using bigger keys than ecdsa and thus it is recommended for inclusion only for its backwards compatibility properties and only for usage where legacy constraints or government regulation forbids the usage of more modern approaches
all the metrics lay in the metrics declaration like counter my_http_requests_total by log_file request_method exemple let s imagine you have an http server log file with get and post 192.168.0.1 get foo 192.168.0.2 get bar 192.168.0.1 post bar with the following mtail program prometheus generated metrics would be -- there are two magic metrics here that can be mangled using prometheus relabel rules prog is the mtail program name script the mtail function getfilename return the log file name containing the log line
we filtering the grouping which has less than 9 rows and for those grouping we repeat the last row for 9 - n times and add these rows to original dataframe using bind_rows
the renderitem prop should be a function that returns a react-native component see there the renderitem method will be called for each element of your marketing_updates array
we found for example that purrr map is much slower than dplyr do which is deprecated we also found that functions like pull are very slow

read -p uses stderr precisely so that it can be used when stdout is redirected it s less common to redirect stderr in such cases
doctrine doesn t even support associations between entities handled by different entitymanager
it s just overall easier to get your freebsd system running and while openbsd can boast to be the most secure operating system out of the box there s however fewer people looking at it and the code and using it which after running it as a user configuring it and installing stuff could make it less secure than freebsd even though it was more secure at installation time
reading the documentation it looks like i need a vpn deployed inside of k8s if i want to have encrypted tunnel so that each internal network can talk to the other side
upd i propose the following code i need that layout should be restricted from min to max cant be less than min and cant be larger than max + without stretching the space it must have fixed size between and around the buttons
my current implementation i have set the following autolayout constraints thumbnail is pegged to superview on top left and bottom thumbnails width is proportional to superview width by a multiple of 0.2 thumbnail is pegged on its right side to title and subtitle trailing space 8 title is pegged to superview on top and right trailing space 8 title is pegged on its bottom to subtitle trailing space 8 title height is greater than or equal to 24 subtitle is pegged to superview on right and bottom trailing space 8 subtitle height is equal to 20 additionally title numberoflines 0 thumbnail contentmode aspect fill thumbnail cliptobounds true the problem the image height does not respect the height of the labels so the height of the cell is set to the full height of the image and the title label is stretched vertically
in my jwt authenticated api i want these paths to be accessible without any authentication and all other endpoints to be disallowed disabled get apis id id post apis patch apis id id delete apis id id get swagger-ui.html as you can see most of the above endpoints begin with apis id post has apis
in your case for instance you initialise a variable called value to be the minimum. your test to continue is whether value is less than max which it will be unless min is greater than max the thing you do each time after executing the body of the loop is .
it is possible and quite common that some heap memory is allocated with malloc in thread a and would be released free -d later in some other thread b often the main thread just before exiting
this is a lot simpler how it works strips off the minutes and seconds from the time reducing every date to just the date and the hour finds the max consumption in that hour finds the max consumption value whose id is less than the min id in the hour the max consumption value from the previous hour subtract the max consumption this hour from the max consumption last hour to give the consumption for this hour there are other ways to skin this cat this works by join the data to itself on id id-1 gets you a this table and a previous table work out the change in consumption between successive records this.value - previous.value and then group them up by the hour same technique as above reduce the datetime to a date and add on the hour s and sum them edit modified the first query to work with your revised sample data the significant change is added a where clause to restrict the rows to just the subset day and device
on pc the infowindow should ideally pop up on mouseover and be hidden on mouseout
i have the following svg the h_img jpg might vary on time loading different images so i can t be aware of its size in advance yet i know that most of the time its height value is greater than its width but i need to apply it to a rect element that has a smaller height compared to its own width and this is for sure despite i m using a relative 100 value for that one
important note i am not comparing the 2 web servers that is not the point of this site but generally they have comparable performance so if https in nginx is 10 times slower than apache i feel that something is wrong in my nginx configuration i want to fix it
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0. element_to_be_clickable element_to_be_clickable locator is defined as follows class selenium.webdriver.support.expected_conditions.element_to_be_clickable locator parameter locator - used to find the element returns the webelement once it is visible enabled and interactable clickable . description an expectation for checking an element is visible enabled and interactable such that you can click it
note that simply detects whether the width is greater than the height

the following code needs to be converted into vb.net from access vb6 or written in vb.net
the aim is to detect any all images on the application that have a height or width that is larger than 500px and if it does then resize it before allowing the request to continue
also namedtuple use less memory than a dictionary since it implements __slots__
if you need more than a double wich is 8bytes an array of int or chars and create your own arithmethic for this type
in this case one would define a simple person class if it is know that certain attributes properties will always be loaded then accessor such as getname could be added though note i would expect name to not be a single entry for most datasets as there typically would be last name first name etc
even you define a variable as double the value which you assigned it will be seen as int if you don t indicate its type
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0
and you get the output 110 instead of the ascii chars n which have the value 110 because the addition causes the chars to be promoted to int values and the result is an int value that is not converted to a chars
a chars 14 14 bytes isn t much larger than an int 4 bytes
so in fact you just need to intercept calls to trait s methods and forward them to corresponding implementations this may be done with cglib or javassist or you may generate relevant dispatchers with a macro
this is due to integer overflow in computer programming an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of digits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value

i am merging two images using ciimage filter cisourceovercompositing issue is it is losing alpha opacity of watermark foreground image if its applied opacity is less than one. i applied alpha value like this i think issue is i need to change alpha from ciimage through some calculation as ciimage working space is not same as uiimage
addition is faster than multiplication
it is faster than mergesort but it still slower than quicksort because quicksort has fewer data movements on random data quicksort requires o log n extra space while timsort requires o n to provide stability which also leads to an overhead

thus to convert directly to date into arcgis your column should be transform as posixct the format f is explained in the help of strftime and lets you decompose the way your date is written
however if the box has an aspect ratio and no specified size its automatic minimum size is the smaller of its content size and its transferred size ...and transferred size if the item has an intrinsic aspect ratio and its computed cross size property is definite then the transferred size is that size clamped by its min and max cross size properties if they are definite converted through the aspect ratio
in summary none of these work it seems that the decimalformat syntax is not compatible with messageformat s argstyletext syntax
if the width is greater than the height it should set the width to 1200 px and calculate the height according to that
meaning the time set for settimeout is always less than setinterval s
you have to respect the aspect ration when you calculate the distance to the center point of the circular view note if you have a rectangular viewport where the width is greater than the height then a perfect circle is squeezed at it left and right to an ellipse when the coordinates are transformed from view space the normalized devices space
for those who are not familiar with map and indexset check this the logic is that i m iterating over the elements of the given array and each time checking whether the value at that index is not less than value at index + 1 by 1 if it is then i am splitting the array using array slice and adding it in a dictionary having a key which is given by the variable count

operating system differences are not by definition at the machine code level most are at the high level language level c libraries that you can to create gui windows etc have nothing to do with the machine code nor the processor architecture for some operating systems the same operating system specific c code can be used on mips or arm or powerpc or x86
if you have a hosts file that you want to compare with another file containing entries you want to eliminate this will be easier with uniq than with grep
note that filtering before the grouping by is usually more efficient so i recommend where instead of having

as you already state content mode option aspect fill tries to fill up the live view and you are also right that it crops some rectangle from center cropping top-bottom or left-right depending upon the image size and the image view size for generic solution there are two possible case the image needed to be cropped along the height to fit the image view proportional drawing height is smaller the image needed to be cropped along the width to fit the image view proportional drawing width is smaller considering your size notation is 4000x3000 height 4000 width 3000 a portrait image and your drawing canvas size is 375x800 height 375 width 800 then your cropping would be height wise while setting the content mode aspect fill
the words are separated by spaces so we choose spaces as delimiter press finish
in the variable-length portion of the argument list all integral arguments smaller than int are promoted to int and float is promoted to double

it s very easy with zsh globs if you are using bash you just need to upgrade
threads -- threads shares a memory space it is an abstraction of the cpu it is lightweight. processes -- processes have their own memory space it is an abstraction of a computer. to parallelise task you need to abstract a cpu. however the advantages of using a process over a thread is security stability while a thread uses lesser memory than process and offers lesser latency. an example in terms of web would be google-chrome and firefox. in case of google-chrome each tab is a new process hence memory usage of google-chrome is higher than firefox while the security and stability provided is better than firefox. the security here provided by google-chrome is better since each tab is a new process different tab cannot snoop into the memory space of a given process
instead of this my opinion of the code inside the for-loop is that the arrays code is more readable than the object code

you are probably better off using cheerio which is lighter than jsdom and supports most of the jquery syntax
as composite numbers are made by multiplication of prime numbers and prime numbers can not be generated from multiplication of any other numbers so the number must be multiplied to all prime numbers some numbers like 6 when they are reached our smallest number is dividable as its already multiplied to 2 and 3 but for those that are not multiplying by a prime number that is obviously less than the number itself so should be in our prime list would make our smallest dividable to that number too

use a numeric for-loop to reduce a into a plain object a numeric for-loop is faster than arrays methods like reduce and foreach and generally faster than for...of and for...in since it doesn t use iterators or reflection to enumerate the keys of the arrays
then you can copy the keys into the map using memcpy compare using memcmp and hash them using any hash algorithm that can hash byte sequences almost every hash algorithm
imperative seems more clear and obvious but a declarative approach scales very nicely for larger applications
in order for this to work the iteration variable of the final for-loop in the previous example must be defined outside loops

for 1 2 answer is 3 for 1 4 2 answer is 3 for the case where answer is 1 if minimum value in the range is greater than 1 then answer is 1
for the case where answer is neither 1 nor max of the range +1 for this case we will need a segment tree that will give smallest missing positive value that is greater than minimum value of the range and less than maximum value of the range . we will use value 0 to represent there is no missing value for this range . for leaf node we will set missing value to 0
this means a for-loop over a list that is being extended within loops will iterate over the extra elements too in other cases you could use a while loops that tests a counter against the length each time while does re-evaluate the expression each iteration a while loops is more cumbersome for this task as now you have to manually maintain the counter index into your self.racks list each time and it s easy to forget or miss the at the end

if your response is really big i would recommend switching to md5hex assertion tick save response as md5 hash box at the advanced tab of the http request sampler calculate md5 checksum of the file the approaches differ depending on the operating system and software you have as the majority of the world is on windows i d suggest winmd5free check out how to use jmeter assertions in three easy steps for other options and more detailed information replace response assertion with md5hex assertion and use the checksum from step 2 instead of full response the idea is that equal strings have equal hash and comparing 2 short hash is faster operation than comparing 2 big strings
so if you specify the text font number of lines you don t need to set fixed width and height
with both boxes floated right the second box is placed on the left of first box +------------------------------------------------+ | +-----++-------+| | | red || black || | +-----++-------+| | | with widths added on the boxes the second box is pushed on a new line +------------------------------------------------+ |+----------------------------------------------+| || black || |+----------------------------------------------+| | +----------------------+| | | red || | +----------------------+| | | with negative left margin width added on second box the second box is placed next to first box +------------------------------------------------+ +----------------------++----------------------------------------------+| | red || black || +----------------------++----------------------------------------------+| | | | | | | | | a rough explanation of this behavior is that when you add a negative margin equal to greater than the width of the element it apparent width becomes 0 and browser will fit it on the same line
however this introduces manual memory management and this can become tricky in more complex code memory leaks double deallocations dangling pointers so a more c++ like solution would be assuming the pointers point to something more interesting than an int because now there seems to be no need for pointers
for instance this exception-handling won t get caught by try-catch and you will see something like this in the console log it happens because java.lang.error extends java.lang.throwable and it is not a child class of java.lang.exception
no it does not work when keyboard pops up and height of webpage is less than its width
or you might have to make adjustments like exclude certain elements from getting relative position applied if they are otherwise positioned already and or not overwrite a higher z-index they might already have. limits this to the children of the parent already descendants further down the tree are no affected.
this is the html i couldn t replicate the problem in any of my browsers but i tried adding and that actually caused the image to appear jagged in firefox and safari so i took it out
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlist
for each component can be configured width height
transient only means more instances created and the istringlocalizerfactory invoked more often than required
the small bucket always contains the median which can be found as max smallbucket.keyset
it seems that google-chrome is stricter than firefox and won t allow this fix to work over regular http
the order by should be constructed concat prepare execute deallocate instead of having that huge expression that cannot use any index
x becomes 3 + 1 not 4 then order of operation causes an unexpected answer to be produced since addition happens after multiplication
push everything to elasticsearch i can push everything to elasticsearch and create graphs on kibana or grafana grafana seems more fit for the job
since null can be returned by malloc in some cases it is safe to pass null as argument to free so that free null just does nothing
since 2018 imebra has objective-c wrappers that can also be imported into swift projects
it can be done with dplyr tidyverse package code output
main magic here is in 2 lines the one that you mentioned and the one which checks if password is changed in fist one the salt for the password is generated in second hash password from database is used to extract the salt which has to be used in crypt method here you have more info minus may be because you didn t put enough work at first and the thing that made it harder for me you didn t put your password verification code and you didn t put your python code
let s say i have the following entries id title year 1 avatar 2009 2 avatar 2020 3 hello 2014 4 hello 2013 5 new 2017 here is how i would get each title with all its years select title group_concat distinct year from table and it would give me title years avatar 2009 2020 hello 2013 2014 new 2017 how would i do a query to get all results where the min year is more than 5 years away from the max year

the block timestamp is within the valid range in bitcoin the timestamp cannot be greater than 2 hours from the current network time and cannot be earlier than the median time of the past 11 blocks
it can be simply done by generating random numbers from the range 0 ... 127 and then doing some arithmetic this will likely be faster than invoking prng multiple times
i had the same problem and could trace it to this javascript source line that worked just fine with firefox and google-chrome according to the mozilla docs this call has an optional 3rd argument
and || i do however have predefined add and sub functions that handle bitwise addition and subtraction and they are used in the following example
simply use a base 64 encoded string to convert to from string and data so now you can construct a dictionary like then create json data on the other side once you receive json data you need to convert it back to dictionary and get the values i hope this fixes your issue but the thing is you may actually need more data than just width and height
the empty list is inside the for-loop meaning that a new empty list is created every iteration the return is also inside the for-loop which is less than ideal you want it to be returned after loops has been exhausted and all suitable elements have been appended
so far what i understand and hope is correct is from i will have temlplated fct 1 signature double int double t1 will be deduced as int t2 as double ans return type double
temlplated fct 2 signature int int double rt will be deduced as int t1 as int and t2 as double
this can be done in scheme racket with apply map list list list 1 5 list 2 6 list 3 7 list 4 8 which in racket returns 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 basically calling in pseudocode is the same as calling map list a b c .
i am working on a project that was written in objective-c and needs to be updated to swift
swift methods with variadic parameters cannot be called from objective-c
default is microsoft sql server but can be changed to postgresql or mysql
if that tag does not exist you could examine the width and height of the image and make a guess if the width is greater than the height it might be landscape if the height is greater than the width it might be portrait this will fail for square images and this will fail for cropped images the photo was taken portrait but the user cropped it such that the width is now greater than the height
tooling is worse the code is longer debugging and profiling is harder
as i can see in your screenshot the uiimageview s height is greater than its width
and for the user that has uploaded picture if you store the relative path to the picture stored in the public folder then you can use if the value of is img profile.jpg then you should have img folder containing profile.jpg within your project public directory

this means that the parent always has a higher value than its children
the children of a maximum value are no higher than the parent so the maximum value in the priority queue never increases
if you wrap a c type as an nsnumber and then unwrap it as above could the type change due to argument promotion which means that int types smaller than int get passed as int values float values as double in c
knowing that pypy is on osx compiled using gcc and apples llvm this is more akin to the linux world than python which is on osx compiled directly against clang
finally i have found an answer...editing the config file of nginx default config file has the apache port and apache html pages path. i suppose this can be done using apache proxy_mod but i don t know which way is better...if anyone can explain the two ways via apache or via nginx i apreciate it
another way is doing is the same. if you already know the dimension of the two arrays maybe is better to take the arguments as pointers it will look like and you will have to allocate memory this coul be done with malloc at the end of your program you will want to free that allocated memory doing free wsk
it is abstract in composition so i can override it in the children now i can add override the method in the track which takes it as a parameter and finally i make the album whose duration is the sum of the tracks it works as intended but i do not understand why i cannot simply use since in kotlin properties are nothing more than getter and setter i m thinking about the getduration in composition
where you can improve your code is to use a for-loop which is faster than a for each when dealing with arrays
what i am looking for is a way to show the desktop view possibly a larger desktop when using the builder on a smaller laptop or tablet so the width of the users screens is smaller than what the desktop view would be
i m trying to prove a that if y a rational-numbers is greater than zero then y is not equal to zero
warning you are using a nested for-loop which means that the process time will grow exponentially if the arrays becomes larger
c + 1 is an int as the operands undergo binary numeric promotion c is a chars 1 is an int so c has to be widened to int to make it compatible for addition
you can use developer tools in the browser and reload the request to see if you right-click the highlighted item and choose copy as libcurl you can use the curlconverter package to automagically turn it into an httr function this is what you get you still need to parse some html note that this is a super common problem that s been covered many times on so
in this case the conversion between int - double takes lower precedence because a user-defined implicit conversion between int - value exists
that fact will be assigned ubuntu on ubuntu and not debian

i want to hide a single div at a time so that below flashing can be avoided show in image note i cannot use visibility hidden or visibility show or or my expectation when i do in the dom see html area in image provided by me where is happening for every element rather i want to hide that particular element at a time so no multiple display hide at a time only one display hide similar to #snippet2 #snippet1 should work but hidden element should not contain any width height below is my code which should work with #snippet1 question above snippet #snippet1 should work as same as below #snippet2 one but without using visibility #snippet2 working without flashing #snippet2 please help me thanks in advance
the way i setup the directories to reproduce your error is this structure root directory package package package __init__.py package a package a __init__.py package a b package a b __init__.py package a b module1.py package c package c __init__.py package c module2.py in package __init__.py put the top-level module imports from a.b import module1 and then the only change i made is to module2.py to contain only this function for testing then in the top-level root of the package from terminal you should be able to run module2.py should print out from a.b.module1 some object improvement and refinements can be made to get the exact behavior you desire
1 maven packaging must be set to war then only it puts everything under webapp into the target war file. if packaging is jar its omitting the webapp directory
transitioning to a for-loop is messier than using a while loops as you re checking a boolean condition
visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0

and that s by design if you want to put anything into the array you must be prepared to get anything out of it
just to note that if you want to update the adfs ssl certificate this does need to be changed for https sites in iis
javascript files would not be included in maven project files such as pom.xml but would be imported into the pages that you are using the javascript in
the dask dataframe is stored mostly on disk rather than in ram- allowing you to work with larger than ram data- and can help you do computations with clever parallelization
your code should look like this your code received an arrayoutofboundsexception because the k in your 3rd for-loop should be 3 instead of 4 since your k should be less than your arrays size which is 3
still odd with height but not with width
i had some benchmarks for google-chrome headless being faster than firefox headless sometimes back
a for-loop is faster than a for each for arrays and using transpose turns it into a one dimensional arrays to loops over
i guess i could have used min or max because they will all say 21 or 22 depending on the month only one to avoid would be sum as this would add them all up
apple recommends using awt s filedialog instead of the swing file chooser because filedialog acts more like the native macos file dialog
i m not familiar with lasagne but you should know that all of tensorflow uses graph based computation unless you use tf.eager but that s another story

maven is way more standardized than ant and this means that you will not always be able to do exactly the same in maven and ant
the server can specify whether the method should be the same as for the original request uri or whether post can be changed to get
as stated in those answers i can not use scipy.integrate.quad to vectorize the integrals over the arrays because it employs an adaptive algorithm which is why i use numpy.trapz below i could also have used scipy.integrate.simps or scipy.integrate.romb this works fine for a single dimension but now i d like to perform a double integral replacing the c2 constant by a variable for what i could gather the only available function is scipy.integrate.dblquad bu that means i could no longer apply the integral to an entire arrays in a single pass and i would have to use a for-loop which is considerably slower
if you re targeting lower api then i would suggest that you generate an rsa key that will be used for aes key wrapping
i think apply solution for such a problem will always be simpler and more readable than dplyr i am assuming you meant tidyverse solution but since you asked here is one way -
and setup project.follow this steps import existing maven project or create a maven project goto project explorer and right click on your pom.xml then select run as maven install
visibility means that the elements are not only displayed but also have a height and width that is greater than 0
visibility means that the elements are not only displayed but also have a height and width that is greater than 0
runtime of o n² i don t consider it worth to care for such one that much better switch to quicksort right from start o n log n average runtime heapsort with maximum o n log n runtime but worse constants than quicksort or intro-sort hybrid of first two standard sorting algorithm of c++ std sort in most implementations
onchange is probably better to use than onkeyup

setting the aspectratio 1 means you always want a square selection you would not be able to select the whole image if the image is rectangular the height is bigger than width or vice versa
there are only two cases where a filechannel is faster than a fileinputstream or fileoutputstream
they recommend filtering list items in the component logic the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself
a custom class must be written extends jlabel implements listcellrenderer
as long as the cpu designer is willing to dedicate the logic multiplication can be almost as fast as addition
there are methods of division that are faster than basic long division but still they are slower than multiplication
code explanation if you re not familiar with setinterval and clearinterval they are similar to settimeout
they have just added server-side encryption support which is much simpler to support compared client-side encryption
but you can have custom getter and setter e.g
imo you have 3 options for implementing equals hashcode use an application generated identity a uuid implement it based on a business key implement it based on the primary key using an application generated identity is the easiest approach but comes with a few downsides joins are slower when using it as pk because 128bit is simply bigger than 32 or 64bit debugging is harder because checking with your own eyes wether some data is correct is pretty hard if you can work with these downsides just use this approach

step 0 the input expression step 1 in terms of operator precedence increment decrement have a higher precedence than multiplication division and multiplication division have a higher precedence than addition subtraction so add some parentheses to clarify that step 2 the next thing to do is to replace the variables with values taking into account how the pre post-increment decrement operators work step 3 the only thing not related to operator precedence performing an operation on integer operands yields an integer result even if the result of the expression is assigned to a floating point type
update onchange is more better than onblur and updated my answer accordingly
the accuracy starts off at around 40 and drops down during one epoch to 25 my model i have 4 labels 60k rows of data split evenly for each label so 15k each and 20k rows of data for evaluation my data example name label abctest label1 mete_test label2 romobo label3 test label4 the input is turned into int for each chars and then hot encoded and output is just turned into int 0-3 1 epoch evaluation loss acc update more details about the data the strings are of up to 20 chars i first convert each chars to int based on an alphabet dictionary a 1 b 2 c 3 and if a word is shorter than 20 chars i fill the rest with 0 s now those values are hot encoded and reshaped so and labels describe the way a word is spelled basically naming convention all lowercase - unicase testbest - camelcase testtest - pascalcase test_test - snake_case with added 2 extra layers and lr reduced to 0.001 pic of training update 2 seems to start and immediately dies with no error -1073740791

signed unsigned chars and short get promoted to respective signed unsigned int float gets promoted to a double wikipedia s variadic arguments page also qualifies that bool chars short and unscoped enumerations are converted to int or wider int types as in int promotion emphasis mine i m not exactly sure what or wider int types actually means
what is not stated is what happens to other larger types such as long long and long double and possibly long if it is longer than an int on the compiler
2.3 signed or unsigned can be combined with chars long short or int

lbs sold yoy actuals-v1 lbs sold yoy actuals-v2 i am more experienced with dax than mdx so any insights would be appreciated
instead of this another common practice when you need a string return value instead of returning a string allocated with malloc -that would need to be released with free - you pass a local buffer that will hold the result as a parameter like this i think your code would benefit greatly if you can transform it to using this style where applicable
there it says in pom.xml add the following xml stanza between i am not familiar with maven or gradle or how it works nor did the documentation of maven really help me with importing this library into my java project in eclipse
the frame of one cell is wider than higher kind of landscape and the other cell is higher than wider portrait
alternate design another design might consist of a more complex arrangement create a dedicated blockingcollection for each id encountered create a single dedicated long-running consumer thread for each blockingcollection each thread that processes a request acts as a producer by enqueing the request to the relevant blockingcollection the producing thread then waits in async style until a response is ready to be collected each consumer thread processes items from its blockingcollection queue in a serialised manner and signals the thread that is awaiting a response once the response is ready a disadvantage of this design is complexity a second disadvantage is that there will be overhead due to switching data between threads at least twice per request however i think that on a reasonably busy system where lots of requests are coming in this might be better at reducing the number of blocking threads
since i m more familiar with bash than zsh i ve included bash references but all this should apply to zsh and other posix-ish shells as well
there are other ready interfaces like webdriver to implement but i am curious if there can be other ways to define an interface and use it for a selenium project to make the project more efficient. a possible use i can think of is define an interface with must methods such as implicitwait dbconnections browsers reportconfig etc and being implemented by a base class which can finally be extended by each page class
however you need to consider that at some point in time ram is no longer sufficient and swapping to hard disk occurs
i have a collection of objects same type that i like to display in my view wpf . these objects are some kind of print previews so every object is a page that could be printed in portrait mode height is bigger than width
i want to store selected checkbox text to firebase when the button is clicked and go to another activity
long int and spacing each needs reasonable less than 21 chars
that s how i should have done that if a height or width is greater than what i ve specified in my setattribute
as of gradlew 4.9 application plugin understands --args option so passing the arguments is as simple as build.gradle src main java my app.java bash
i d rather not refactor the layout to not use screens have a single screens and just switching out the widgets that are not common between screens when changing nor do i want to add if this_widget_on_current_screen style logic to every property s on_change handler
you used here don t use because when number is greater than 0 min and max value will be set to the input number so the if and else if statement below it will not work
the empty string is used as a delimiter between individual joined letters so they will be joined without spaces or other symbols. and i deleted all superfluous useless statements
in terms of implementation terracotta ehcache may be based on top of jgroups services and provides a specific set of apis specific of a caching system and so less generic than hazelcast
and it has a parent can be retrieved using qabstractitemmodel parent qmodelindex qabstractitemmodel parent const qmodelindex index const returns the parent of the model item with the given index
i ve also tried providing different types instead of chars sticking to the ones that std hash should be able to handle automatically such as int and std string
to compute these gradients a symbolic definition of the model is needed which requires the model to be defined using tensorflow either directly or through a high-level abstraction like keras
see the blog post all new sites on netlify are https by default and this issue on github issue #158 disabling forced ssl even for old sites the option to turn off https or to turn off the redirect to https is no longer available
am creating method for library with two int parameters min max method can accept only the parameters if max value is bigger than the min value on the run time means while the person is writing down the code if the parameter is not valid it shows warning before running the code because i need to get random number between both values
the aurora it is completely different database than mysql but when it comes to the compability with mysql or postgresql amazon team did a lot so that there would not be a lot of differences
use pypy as interpreter it is up 6 times quicker than cpython if it is not enough use a quicker language than python
i am using migradoc because its at a higher level than pdfsharp
you can use some commands like this the caveat is that you will need to use this conda installation whenever you need to use the aws cli but its easier than messing with system-wide installations or pip configs imo and conda is more robust than a python virtualenv
that is this should suffice tested with ggplot2 version 3.1.0 alternatively as i mentioned in annotate outside plot area once in ggplot with facets you can make use of cowplot draw_label
the output is a string and as such double-quotes need to be escaped with backslash
my issue is a duplicate and the answer to my question was given by stefan-peshikj in turns out google-chrome and safari are more permissive than firefox which doesn t accept an turn url with username not accepted accepted this solves my issue
int is a 16-bit signed int type that can easily fit into a double which is much larger than 16 bits
in cases where that is practical however it will often allow better performance than using many separate calls to fread and may be nicer than using fgets
here s another approach using the tidyverse packages since dplyr has more or less supplanted plyr
parent params can be consumed in children but not vice versa
this is faster than a for-loop by creating a correlation matrix with np.newaxis in the index and then np.argwhere mask to get the mapping from the old arrays to the new
there are three main problems should be sum can not be used before be initialized so int division so cast either sum or numofints to be a double
i recently read in so that even vs2017 still seems not to support them. so for a portable solution this has to be fiddled with malloc and free btw. malloc and free are more stack-friendly than vlas because allocating on heap and i realized that a lot of people in this community are very critical concerning extensive stack usage
i know that pack and pack_forget can be used to show or hide widgets
the max values of the rgb channels are lower than that of the n channel but look at the mean values of the rgb channels they are much smaller than max 2 you have a high dynamic range hdr image here and want to compress its high range to 8 bits for displaying
what i do locally is i add in each company repository e.g product_x_company_a except for origin that has its own repo url also parent pointing to product_x repo git remote add parent if you type git remote -v you will see a list like that in this specific folder origin fetch origin push parent fetch parent push then changes being pushed to the product can be pulled from children repos locally like that git pull parent master and if everything works as expected locally - they can be pushed to specific clients repo like that git push origin master you don t usually need to commit something as you are passing commits from one repo to the other basically
i ve got a problem with my program a bit here is the the code the problem is in the file i ve got parent who have more than 1 children example mary- patricia mary- lisa but when i call children_and_parents mary .child i get only lisa but i should get patricia and lisa also i would like them to be different entities so i can call and use them later on
after that the oracle patch 19692824 dbcontrol is not coming up on oel 7 must be installed to upgrade the versioning of oem agent
if you read the advanced integrations section they suggest doing this adds an event listener for the load event on the script element that loads stripe and sets the state when it is available so no continuous polling with setinterval settimeout is needed
can anyone help me to clear my doubts - why debian os takes less time for context switching although ubuntu is based on debian kernel
updated to be well-formed python output if you re able to use lxml it has much better xpath support than elementtree
proceed with caution consider using the rectify function running the rectify function throws the following error error in .intersectextent x y validate true objects do not intersect in addition warning messages 1 in .local x ... min y larger than max y 2 in .local x ... min y larger than max y and when rectifying just one layer in the raster stack like so generates the following error error in validitymethod object invalid extent ymin ymax i can t tell what s wrong
instead handle it in one event handler only like this edit additional logic will be needed to show hide the text below but that should be simple enough
this happens as a result of that std is_trivial which is used in stl to determine if a class can be copied via memmove memcpy or resort to a loop
the previously installed packages will be downgraded upgrade to the new versioning
for me logging in was as simple as sudo mysql -u root don t forget the sudo i really hope there should have been a message stating that ubuntu no longer used passwd when attempting to run mysql
included name you might not need to pad the id or salary so much come of the casts to chars on flag columns can be dropped if the flag column is 100 guaranteed to always be 1 chars long if salary max value in table is larger than an int can hold consider a cast to something else by padding the salary with leading zeroes the sort will work out
preloadjs is really only designed to load webaudio sounds to be played with soundjs
as a maintainer of the createjs libraries i am certainly biased but if you want to preload audio with preloadjs then soundjs is a better option than howler
it seemed it was way to tricky to be handled with subprocess and hence i had to pexpect to solve this and it worked in first go
the long contour is considered a line if its width is much longer than its height or its aspect ratio is large such as 8 and you need also to optimize this value finally you should get something like that
a very inelegant solution with dplyr and tidyr which someone can probably build on update
if you read the travis log you can see project name missing project description missing project url missing license information missing scm url missing developer information missing invalid pom.xml io reactivex rxjava2 rxjavafx 2.11.0-rc31 rxjavafx-2.11.0-rc31.pom project name missing project description missing project url missing license information missing scm url missing developer information missing missing no javadoc jar found in folder maven central has many more requirements than bintray i suggest you look through the minimum requirements here
chars has size of 1 byte and int has bigger size depending on platform 4 bytes most of the times
int is in your case probably 4 times bigger than chars resulting in looping over whole of your data structure of type chars 4 times quicker as you expected
note the intent is that an inline-functions that is the subject of an explicit instantiation declaration will still be implicitly instantiated when odr-used 3.2 so that the body can be considered for inlining but that no out-of-line copy of the inline-functions would be generated in the translation unit. end note 14.7.3 a declaration of a function template class template or variable template being explicitly specialized shall precede the declaration of the explicit specialization
in a max-heap the parent is greater than the children
we can have a new type of heap where the parent is in the middle of the children - the left child is smaller than the parent and the right child is greater than the parent
the zoom is ignored if the elapse time between mousedown and mouseup is less than the double click time
imageview will automatically resize based on height of the textview and wrap of the width
you would then ensure that apache or maybe lighttpd which is lighter weight is running on your rpi
and the artwork image it self can not be bigger than height or width 100 of the grid-item max-width 100
i started by using a bootstrap template and could quite easily generate fields with min max values etc now i would like to setup input elements that could hold only numbers and also would persist to use a certain variable amount of decimals
the first solution likely will be faster with smaller list of dicts since the sorting is easier but you would need to test that. it is not required in the solution that i gave that the keys be grouping it is required for groupby to work
so i would recommend either using matplotlib 1.5 together with seaborn 0.7 or matplotlib 2.2.3 or higher together with seaborn 0.9
for example it can be done using loops consider the last dictionary since dataframe is expected to be pretty large and it may have many columns to select on i am looking for the efficient way to solve the problem without using for-loop to iterate the dataframe
the textview with id recomm_prdct_itemdesc cannot have the height set to matchconstraint as it does not have a reference view to match its constraint like the width which can be matched to imageview with id recomm_prdct_img
react-native-router-flux is a wrapper over react-navigation it is really simple to use and allows you to write a lot less code than with react-navigation however if you want to implement complex features it might not be the best choice
in your case it s int because chars can be implicitly be converted to int easily but not always the other way around
i did it to support the postgresql jsonb datatype something similar could be made for mysql
this works perfectly well in firefox but google-chrome never downloads more than 10 files
i would argue that every bit of code should be covered including getter and setter tostring equals and hash code
imagemagick has many more features than graphicsmagick but may be slightly slower
to read a whole file into an array of pointers to char which represent the lines you can do using only a fixed-size two-dimensional array and fgetc could be done with fgets too
if you want to stick to python then you can use mayavi which is faster compared to matplotlib
there is also a page called data type precedence transact-sql documenting what type would be implicitly converted to what type when the implicit conversion is a result of a calculation - for example - 1 + 2 would result with 3 since int has a higher precedence than chars result implicitconversiondemo 3
it will be called server-side once on the first request to the nuxt app and client-side when navigating to further routes
i am trying to integrate spring cloud zuul with the consul. both the microservice userui and zuul apigateway get registered with consul
biginteger cannot be converted to int error incompatible types stringbuilder cannot be converted to chars c sb.append c
i know what i could save the variable value to a temp file but i am trying to do this without creating intermediary files i still have two stream that could be used stderr and stdout
however it s my experience that gradle is not slower or faster than either maven or ant
glew must be included before glfw
use something that ll always cover every other option like or as swordfish commented you can flip the bits of an unsigned integer literal to answer your comment you can explicitly tell the compiler what type you want your enum to have enum eventtype unsigned int
the downside is that the only place it prints its output is standard output you may send an std ostream object and use it instead of std cout converting an int to an std string is very conveniently possible with std to_string
since we have multiple schemas for various data objects i want to make my code cleaner by using something like this activities and fragments can inherit from realmowner and implement the mandatory realmcontainer using lifecyclerealmcontainer and passing their lifecycle into it then - the initrealm would be called with oncreate and closerealm would be called with ondestroy
note that i deliberately did not use strcpy because if length is known memcpy is more efficient and if not known strcpy is unsafe risking undefined behaviour due to writing beyond target array bounds
a hacky solution that worked for me if m2e is complaining that the following jar is not found in the maven cache you can find the bad path in the error log for the pom.xml file or in the java build path maven dependencies list then try the following command fill in java_version_here for an installed jdk jdk1.8.0_191-amd64 then use the two path sections after .m2 repository above to determine the correct groupid and replace 1.6 with whatever version m2e is complaining about -- it may or may not matter if the jdk you have installed matches the version m2e is complaining about this command copies tools.jar from your jdk and puts it into the maven cache also creating a pom.xml file for it so that it can be used by maven
i am guessing that count distinct is a better approach than union in the subquery but you could test that
there are applications where maintaining the necessary data integrity using an external database sqlite mysql postgresql makes more sense
i am trying to create a python script where the user can type in their fasta file and that file will then be parsed using biopython
limited ram where your working set is significantly bigger than ram and slow disk can contribute to slow queries
edit and inside your toolbar xml node add the id attribute with value toolbar as called in oncreate callback since the view with toolbar as id could not be found findviewbyid returns null and setsupportactionbar will get a null value that means no toolbar to cast as actionbar
try this one - problems with your query - you are trying to insert more than 10 chars in course increase the size to 20 you are using int for timeofupdate and inserting a string value - change the type to datetime username should be a string
my question is how can i import pdf from mysql string to be edited by fpdf and fpdi or any other free pdf classes
if you try to start a thread when the number of active threads is less than max and greater than min you ll see a 2 second delay

vhdl needs more code to describe a program but it often catches errors missed by verilog emphasizes unambiguous semantics and is portable just to name a few
to make it easier than a for-loop you could use .map to create a new arrays from the old one by transforming each object
to achieve expected result use below option do another check for end date checking if greater than 28 add and subtract days based on that condition codepen -
i prefer having setter getter
since you have initialize a git repo using git init in a parent folder automatically all the subfolders children will be added to the repository and can be controlled from parent folder
500-599 for errors rejections i prefer this to simple int and while it can be less descriptive than chars it can also be less ambiguous
as you mentioned in your question geckodriver firefox combination is faster then chromedriver google-chrome at this point it is worth to mention that diferent browsers render the html dom in a different way
if you try to start a thread when the number of active threads is less than max and greater than min you ll see a 2 second delay. so i ve prepared a sample code to test it threadpool.getminthreads returns 8 for my machine and i run the code on my local machine
if you try to start a thread when the number of active threads is less than max and greater than min you ll see a 2 second delay
but the height of cells is bigger than their width
that is because we have the same amount of elements at both side but the median value is closer to the minimum thus there should be elements with smaller difference between them
with regard to aspect ratio the general accepted terms are landscape an element with a width greater than height portrait an element with a height greater than width square an element with equal height and width react native implements aspectratio as a non-standard property of nodes not of viewport defined as a number allowing locking the ratio between width and height in place
an aspectratio value of 2 will attempt to size the node with having a height two times smaller than the width and a value of .2 will result in a node having a height 5 times bigger than the width
which i see you re already doing but you can do it a little cleaner using an istream_iterator as far as evaluating out of range you can easily evaluate if there are any elements less than minimum using any_of and either a lambda or a bind statement for example live example
i m doing a web application where i need to use websockets and for that i use the socket.io library in local everything works correctly but when it comes to uploading to my vps with windows server 2012 it does not work i got the following error so i opened port 8082 from the windows firewall but this port is for protocol communication http and according to the socket.io library i need the communication to be done through https protocol since if i try to access through this port i get the following error my server is from godaddy and i already have ssl certificate i would like to know how i can open a port that communicates by https protocol since before i tried my application on a test server called www.c9.io and it works correctly because on this server the ports are already configured to be accessed by the url with the http protocol and https protocol both i appreciate your help i do not really know much about ports and servers it s my first vps thank you very much
int is more specific than double because there s an implicit conversion from int to double but no conversion from double to int
so your second example represents this data obs id name value 1 1 blah 100 2 2 has spaces 200 3 3 ends with quotes 300 4 4 surrounded with quotes 300 if you want to represent it as a delimiter file where none of the values are allowed to contain the delimiter in other words not as a standard csv file than it would look like id name value 1 blah 100 2 has spaces 200 3 ends with quotes 300 4 surrounded with quotes 300 but if you want to allow the values to contain the delimiter then you need some way to distinguish embedded delimiter from real delimiter
it seems if the image width height is more than 35000 pixels it does not show pixels grater than 35000
and of course add the username and passwd that you already created on postgres if you don t have an user you can create one like this sudo -u postgres createuser -s dev sudo -u postgres psql passwd dev #here you can type the passwd you want for this user q in this example we are creating a user named dev so you add dev to the username part and change the passwd for the one you typed
the first two lines of the file are names the third line is a number and any line after that will be ten int with a newline chars at the end
i m getting my image from base64 decode it then check if the image width is less than the height
udp snat ports generally exhaust much faster than tcp snat ports due to the difference in the algorithm used
i want to export selected data from excel sheet to simple txt file. column a must be exported as int column b as string column c as int column d as string column e as double on export must save data as double format - 35.50 30.00 0.00 you can take a look to attached picture for more info. column a.b c d are fine but i can not force column e values to to be extracted to txt file as double in excel this column is look fine - 35.00 for example but when is extracted to txt file is 35 this is my vba script and that is result in my txt file 1 1144641 1 name-string value 350.5 everythink is just fine except last value must be 350.50 you can take a look at the screenshot in the attachment

to start here is the first two arrays where array1 0 0 will be used to subtract the the input value from array3 0 0 and then array2 0 0 will be used multiplying the now subtract value from array3 0 0 to give the new output of array3 1 0 in other words these calculations will get array3
because addclass is much more common than removeclass i d suggest making an object indexed by service_type whose values are selectors which indicate which classes should be removed
if we refer to the above linked document as well this provides the current data type precedences sql server uses the following precedence order for data types user-defined data types highest sql_variant xml datetimeoffset datetime2 datetime smalldatetime date time float real decimal money smallmoney bigint int smallint tinyint bit ntext text image timestamp uniqueidentifier nvarchar including nvarchar max nchar varchar including varchar max chars varbinary including varbinary max binary lowest notice that time has a far higher precendence than varchar thus your value is implicitly cast to a time and
multicastloopback cannot be accessed from tcp sockets and lingerstate cannot be accessed from udp sockets thus tcpclient and udpclient are not out of the box json serializable

i have an array i have calculated its cosine distance with pdist and got the distance array now i want to get only those pairs which s cosine distance is greater than 0.4 and less than 0.49
since i wasn t sure if perhaps i had a hidden blocking io request somewhere i figured it would be worth testing the example project from the akka http site alternatively you can bootstrap a new sbt project with akka http already configured using the giter8 template i ve gone ahead and boot strapped it as per the instructions and run the server on local host i ran some very trivial tests with ab tool simple test performing sequential requests we see that the in this case now i bumped the concurrency up to 5 now time per request has increased quite sharply 2.040 ms mean throughput is much higher though and again bumping up to 50 concurrent requests here the latency is extremely high at 13.861ms vs the first case which was at 0.880ms latency increased about factors 16 this simple server has no blocking io
however when the space key is pressed the current value of width 3 will be assigned to height as a static value. after that the height will remain fixed at this value even if the width changes
copy-paste from official python documentation import getopt sys official documentation is here for tutorials see for example on the other hand argparse is easier if you like to get it done in an easier but not c-like way
your first attempt was great except that you should have provided matrix rather than data frames lm as.matrix dependents as.matrix explanatory that however is for the case when explanatory doesn t include any factors
i have isolated down to first top section - 2 textboxes 2nd aligned under the first that has a width that spans over 11 columns to the tablix below followed next to it on the right by an image fit proptional that s height is greater than the 2 textboxes combined but width is the same as the 12th column
you can also omit the primary key in the serializable data of this object since it can be calculated during deserialization by passing the --natural-primary flag

since the generation of the page is done server-side before it is displayed to the user regarding the asp side of things disregarding any ajax that is triggered and posted to the page that may be called client-side you can just provide these instructions in the page load method
instead of explicitly giving the frame a width and height it s usually better to let tkinter do that for you
as i understand it the first method will create activities in portrait mode regardless of phone orientation at the moment of creation meaning that the activity will be created in portrait mode even if you hold the phone in landscape while the second one will create the activity in a configuration given by the phone orientation and then change so if you hold the phone in landscape position and create an activity you ll see the activity created on landscape and then reconfigure itself to portrait mode
i made some minor changes -use enum instead of 4 boolean makes cleaner code -do not use me.refresh it s slow and does things you do not need here -it s better to use not two int lists but one point list hope it helps
on top of that postgresql gives better performance with ef than mysql

advertised.host.name should not need to be changed in ambari but if you did then set it to the sandbox hostname if you don t need hadoop and all the other stuff in hdp i suggest getting the hdf sandbox or just using docker for windows and using the kafka containers on dockerhub
my theory is that opening more instance than cpu could handle would make processors less efficient
setsid is easier and it is usually preferable to have the child run in a new process group anyway as it and its children can be sent a signal without affecting any other processes. now whenever a process that has no controlling terminal opens a terminal device a tty or a pty that device will become its controlling terminal unless the o_noctty flag was used when opening the device
to test that theory move all those calls out of viewdidload and into something later such as viewdidappear
note if you pass dictionary map replaces all values from series with nan if it does not match with dictionary s keys i think you have also done the same executing the statement twice

the addition is performed using floating point arithmetic. with your particular values a s exact int value and the addition result s exact int value are not representable exactly with double and therefore the result is inexact
this attribute tells the compiler that this piece of swift code can be accessed from objective-c
i know i can set a custom variable in httpd.conf to be accessed in .htaccess

as a rule of thumb anything that needs to be created for the fragment which is not a view should be declared in oncreate and anything with a findviewbyid should go in oncreateview not onviewcreated
the setting you re looking for is jmeter.save.saveservice.subresults you need to set it to false however please avoid modifying jmeter.properties file otherwise you may run into the situation when it will be overwritten during upgrade to the next jmeter versioning
also there is not need of calling setcontentview again in onpause because your layout is already get created when oncreate is called
fgetc returns an int that is either eof -1 or 0-255 so ch should have been declared int and then when is true ch will contain 0-255. in the following you are again reading from the file but into the array at the index position ch which is clearly not your intention and it will also probably crash when you read a chars with value 9

step 3 - define constant class and add set portrait orientation and set landscape right orientation function in the class
since we want these two lists to be treated as equals we must let gethashcode produce the same value for each of them
here is a basic example as you can see the trick is to define the margin considering the width of the container 100 and we will have two cases when the width is bigger than xpx we have a positive margin and a normal behavior with spacing when the width is smaller than xpx we will have a negative margin and will have the overlap effect without wrapping
note this multiplication was chosen over this because double multiplication is about 3.6x faster than double division on the cpu that i m dealing with
correct solutions in bash we need to use type -p -p force a path search for each name even if it is an alias builtin or function and returns the name of the disk file that would be executed in zsh we need to use whence -p -p do a path search for name even if it is an alias reserved word shell function or builtin. for a version that works in both

the width will be smaller than the height because the phone is in portrait mode is there an easy conversion i can do
this can be solved by grouping in a non-equi join to cover requirements 1 and 3 and subsequent filtering for requirement 4 and subsetting for requirement 2
you should first initialize those variables to the first element in the array and then loop the rest of the array starting with and updating the values of min and max only if the current element is lower or higher respectively than min and max
a driver for each kind of device that might be plugged in keyboard mouse touch screen bar-code scanner ...
you can rely on element.getboundingclientrect for both parent and child and set a private property on children if their .bottom is bigger than the parent s pun intended
the problem is that the children are bigger than the parent thus they re drawn outside of it overflow
your table s will become huge -- threatening to overflow the disk and slowing down queries due to bulky rows mean that fewer rows can be cached in ram
elements with the attribute role with one of the following values will also be considered clickable button tab link checkbox menuitem menuitemcheckbox menuitemradio source so if your div elements represent checkbox your code would look like this in this case you are not depending on specific class names which are by the extension considered as unreliable
your loop continues while but an unsigned integer is always greater than or equal to zero
let s add some border and we will clearly see what is happening as you can see the nested sticky elements are both having their width equal to parent width since they are block element so there is no room for the left-sticky to have any sticky behavior 1 since it has width 100 unlike the top one that can still stick because its height is less that the parent height
this can be solved by grouping in a non-equi join to aggregate over a rolling window of length k filtering for k consecutive years and an update join which returns op s expected result grp nr yr nr_roll_period 1 a 1.0 2009 na 2 a 2.0 2009 na 3 a 1.5 2009 na 4 a 1.0 2010 na 5 b 3.0 2009 na 6 b 2.0 2010 na 7 b na 2011 na 8 c 3.0 2014 na 9 c 3.0 2019 na 10 c 3.0 2020 na 11 c 4.0 2021 3.333333 the intermediate result mdt contains the rolling mean v2 over k periods and the count of unique distinct years v1 within each period
it should be because when width is bigger than height we calculate and set measure dimension base on width not height

for methods that can be generated like getter setter you can use this answer for methods there is no functionality to edit javadoc
6.3.1.8 describes these conversions ... otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type. ... you can hunt through the standard for similar justification for returning -1 for a function returning a signed type but it s basically the same argument so i won t bother. in other words yes this is perfectly correct

you need to check your size on disk is not full - this s often happen due to creation of some virtual devices that are unused the ram size of emulator is not minimum as your requirements one more thing that i personally use use pen drive as a ram updated use hdd as ram right click on this pc or my computer and select properties
in datatables when handling the crud methods on the client-side and using the django rest framwork api we need to point the right method to the right url which means use the list url for post and get a list since we are not handing a single existing instance so in my case the url would be url api edit_tanks user the detail url for put delete and get an instance need to pass the pk to identify the instance in ajax _id_ can be used to get the pk in the url
here for example using numpy library it is arguably more common than keras or tensorflow
disclaimer i m not very intimately familiar with linux ubuntu docker etc
add basename param to the browserrouter you also need to update the laravel route file to always go to the app index route if it matches the pattern ... project ... so project and project currency both should be routed by laravel to index which is the app and the app handles the routing logic from there on. had to do the same with my cakephp project
this problem could be related to the speed of typing and event handlers that are attached to the input field these event handlers execute slower than input keyup keydown frequency

now why does llvm add this library search path i don t know probably because it was built with gcc 4.8 - or smth close to it but here s what i can think of llvm is not meant to be used with gcc 7 although i didn t find any such restriction while quickly browsing llvm getting started with the llvm system a bug in llvm considering the other issue that i ran into i tend to think this is the winner i found ways for both of them use an older g++ 4.8 - installed by default on the docker might even not be necessary g++ not cmake this time doesn t know about cxx_std_17 so the easiest way is to remove the afferent target_compile_features the drawback is that code won t be c++17 compliant since i don t know how to undo passing the faulty library search path the workaround that i came up with is to specify the correct one before it

i then read the install documentation for keras and it says that tensor flow needs to be installed first so i did that by doing this in the anaconda prompt after checking pip install tensorflow i then got an error message and it said that the version was not supported so i found out that the latest anaconda version that i just installed which was built with python 3.7 and was not compatible with tensorflow which is limited to python 3.6. so i then created a python 3.6 virtualenv within conda by doing i then activated the virtualenv conda activate virtualenv then within this virtualenv i installed the tensorflow pip package that was supported with windows and python 3.6 by looking at the version list here so i copied the link for the version developed for windows and python 3.6 cpu only which is and then i added that url into the command to install it the install completed and installed some other stuff too successfully installed absl-py-0.6.1 astor-0.7.1 gast-0.2.0 grpcio-1.17.1 h5py-2.9.0 keras-applications-1.0.6 keras-preprocessing-1.0.5 markdown-3.0.1 numpy-1.15.4 protobuf-3.6.1 setuptools-40.6.3 six-1.12.0 tensorboard-1.12.2 tensorflow-1.12.0 termcolor-1.1.0 werkzeug-0.14.1 wheel-0.32.3 i then read the keras documentation from their website and then i installed keras i then closed the anaconda prompt window and relaunched it and didn t have any problems so to recap do not use conda use pip to install tensorflow and keras
the command always produces the following output which i would like to suppress generating a 2048 bit rsa private key ............................................. .............................................................+++ ........................................+++ writing new private key to . private.key i already tried to redirect the output with any variants of but his doesn t work in this scenario because of these reasons the openssl command is executed within a powershell session like this again the redirection of the powershell streams doesn t work either. this wouldn t be a problem at all but if your run the command in a non interactive mode the openssl output will be send to stderr and not to stdout
you can assign the result of crypt 3 to a and reference the hash from the pointer since crypt 3 has its own static data space it will rewrite on every call to it you may want to copy the hash to your program s space using a char array and strcpy 3 or more tersely in this way hash won t be overwritten when crypt 3 is called again

to find the unique css selector i would recommend using google-chrome or chromium i am yet to find how to get the css selector in firefox
since the keras api is more recommended there is probably interest in converting a regular tensorflow graph session to use the keras api with as few alterations to their code as possible
even though the above steps should have changed the build.gradle file you should check it to make sure and also sync the project with the gradlew file 1 expand gradlew scripts and double-click build.gradle module app
the solution when using ionic 4 you can simply type ionic ssl generate in the root of your project and then go to your browser settings firefox 65.0b8 settings - safety - scroll down to certificates - click on show certificates - click on import - choose the generated cert.pem from your project - restart cmd+q your browser google-chrome others must be similiar to firefox if you just use angular with webpack you can generate a certificate by using this script and follow this

i m trying to create my first website and ive added content to it however when the screens is made smaller to that of a tablet or mobile screens size it doesn t scale down properly and leaves everything disorganised
my css is constructed this way any time input is focused mobiles keyboard shows up and all my styles switch to landscape orientation as much as i understand because the width is larger than height and it thinks that device is in landscape orient. however i don t want this to happen
so it can look like that so the context object is to be shared between parent and their children
also i first wanted to have only one modal and first show the progress bar and then when the data would be loaded it hide the progress bar and show the data in the modal but i it only work the first time then when i click on another event or the same event the progress bar does not show up
advantages 1.decentralized and decoupled architecture using choreography rather than orchestration makes services publish-subscribe based and as a result fully decentralized 2.do one thing and do it well unix philosophy more focused and singular with very narrow functionality 3.easy to have parallelism and load balancing because of being more fine-grained from the business process point of view 4.statelessness however having a stateful microservices is valid but it is not the ideal 5.individual data storage makes services relaxed to keep tracing the data-flow 6.easy and automated deployment and discovery due to use of container engine-based technologies such as docker 7.more interoperability which makes services able to have more flexibility in accepting dropping a new current service or protocol 8.fully compatible with representational state transfer rest which allows creating stateless services 9.suitable for discrete systems for example for batch automation process disadvantages 1.service synchronization keeping services synchronized in a cooperative way 2.difficult to find systematic problems for example finding a problem in a chain of business activities when there is a logical error in the process is more difficult and it requires to combine several log files into one piece 3.automated deployment and discovery is a must when the number of microservices is more than a few 4.difficult to find the right service granularity which can lead the entire system into instability due to overwhelmed network communication and error rations 5.challenging when the business system is not discrete enough like continues process control 6.developing an automated test is significant difficult than monolithic systems following are a set of articles that published about microservices in code-project you can read and comment on your questions if you like
the problem appears only if the height is bigger then the width this increases the number of limits for the width from 2 to 3 width must be less or equal than 1280 don t exceed width width must be less or equal than initial width don t upscale width must be less or equal than 1280 width height don t exceed height to test for all cases you would use creating a filter of edit in some versions of ffmpeg the line above will not work citing self-referencing issues
in this case we can create an alternative line of thought if the width is bigger than or equal to the height we scale by width using min iw 1280 if the height is bigger than the width we scale by height using min ih 1280 the expression would then be don t forget that you might run this through some shell parsing mechanism which would additionally create the need to escape the commas
if you re on an embedded cpu where division is more expensive you can accomplish exactly the same thing like this the total amount added to accum here is just like the first example but the division is replaced with an incremental repeated subtraction
however at least quicksort is not slower than mergesort for the random case

it is possible to build something like what you re actually thinking of in objective-c using forwardinvocation but it doesn t translate well into swift the underlying machinery can t be implemented in swift and i don t recommend it
this is a result for a responsive bootstrap4 carousel on mobile and tablet but when the screens width is more than 676px it is no longer a carousel
you have to reserve memory to 0 very wrong to copy strings you have to usr strcpy the correct function nowadays is strncpy is more safe
some developers there say that firefox performs much slower than google-chrome or edge in these scenarios but i haven t found a way to validate a difference personally
note this bug is older than forking blink from webkit
you can find most of default email templates in edx app edxapp edx-platform lms templates emails if you can not see the changes immediately you may need to clear compiled folder directory
we can use map from purrr also both the steps can be done with tidyverse in another way with separate_rows and group_by summarise
shadows are different because google-chrome is buggy since many years this is expected to be fixed in google-chrome 73 march 2019 the simplest thing you can do for cross browser shadows is just to create it with firefox or safari
i would drop the idea of absolute content if its not necesarry and try something similiar to where you basically make every container a flex and the non scalable part of its content will have fix width height and the other part get flex 1 which is shorthand for taking rest of the space
even if b1 was picked up immediately after a1 failed you d have to wait to consume a2 until a1 was consumed in order to preserve order and since the queue must be consumed fifo that would block the consumption of c1 and any of the other messages behind it
if in your real chart you have hundreds of elements a better solution is first filtering them and after that applying the changes both on mouseover and mouseout which gives you better performance

you just have to make sure that you always use bind parameters now if some is trying to hack this query the sql injection attack will be prevented jpql injection sql injection can also happen when using jpql or hql queries as demonstrated by the following example the jpql query above does not use bind parameters so it s vulnerable to sql injection
a loop with functions like strncmp or memcmp may come in handy here more than strstr which requires null-terminated strings as parameters
i have worked with google test gtest previously which i am sure allowed your text fixture class to inherit the class you were testing so it could have access to the protected methods of the class being tested without them needing to be exposed as public
now for pre-production testings is mandatory use servers running together such as activemq rabbitmq mysql postgresql due this the pc goes slower even worst if sonarqube and jmeter are running
edit if you need to send back user input as the op explained in the comments then you are better off with get or post params
you may only rarely need to do anything more than extends the abstract classes with nothing more to implements than the common action

it s important to note that when calling t-test with the formula interface y x and where your independent variable is a factors then using the setting will test whether the mean in the lower factors level in the case of your data inter is greater than the mean in the higher factors level here that s mono
probably some debate can be had about that decision but i felt like that was a lot less work than extends each abstract enum class with a custom one of my own and implements the abstract functions
i am implementing dask but its slower than normal pandas sequential streaming
because when you are in the for-loop you are incrementing number variable wich is loops index and should be managed by loops itself
but addcustom 0 integer would be an error a + 1.2 cannot be done with integer arithmetic because 1.2 is not an integer value it s a fractions number
here s what for example a form looks like on my site with a computer i would like that when the screens is smaller tablet like ipad or mobile the name of the field for example email go alone in a line and take like class col-sm-12 and the field who is related to the name field go on the line of underneath and also take col-sm-12. as the screens of a mobile is quite small i would also like to have a single field per line and not 2 as is currently the case in the case where the user uses a mobile or tablet
you can however override the drag and drop functionality in an extension of the nsstatusbarbutton as displayed in swift note that overriding in extensions is not technically something that should be done in swift but in objective-c it might be acceptable
you should use map.panto but set your zoom level so that the change between both points actual and new is less than the width and height of the map to get a smooth transition
and if that s the case that s not really a for-loop that s more of a while loops in which case i d do a script task instead of a for-loop and handle whatever you re trying to do in there

ideally the docker-compose file would install the traefik container including authentication so that traefik can be managed with a webui have traefik use let s encrypt to generate and maintain ssl certificates that traefik will use to reverse proxy both docker and non-docker services install a sample container like apache that will be tagged so traefik will reverse proxy to http automatically redirects reverse-proxy a non-container service at to http automatically redirects i ve seen plenty of examples on how to use traefik and to tag new containers so that they are reversed proxied but precious few on how to reverse proxy non-docker services
prefer using a keras optimizer instead see keras.io optimizers . seems tensorflow optimizers can t be preserved by keras
bufferedwriter has a better buffer writing implementation than filewriter performance wise unless prompt output is required it is advisable to wrap a bufferedwriter around any writer whose write operations may be costly such as filewriters and outputstreamwriters
you shouldn t use pipes for filtering or sorting lists the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself
in some platforms the value should be decoded on server-side client-side encoding - js from mdn server-side decoding - c# follow this answer
so when moving right or down just ensure the values don t grow larger than the width or height of the window -- minus the width and height of the image of course since the position is from the top-left

i have a csv file that can be accessed using pandas but fails with dask dataframe. i am using exact same parameters and still getting error with dask
and for what it s worth when you re iterating over an arrays a for-loop is a better fit because it allows you to define the iteration variable the condition and the increment all in one place
it was explicitly typed as an integer in the code i saw so presumably it s central to ensuring the algorithm works. didn t change. became didn t change. became this time the condition containing the junction reads in english as if temp is less than or equal to both acu and acu times value
however if i put all the flight records together the dataset contains many airlines so the flight distance vary from each other the fuel cost positively changed with the altitude because usually the longer the flight distance is the higher a plane would fly and a longer flight distance always means more fuel cost

the patch spec notes a comparison to post is even more difficult because post is used in widely varying ways and can encompass put and patch-like operations if the server chooses
is a json array so it can be parsed with gson or jackson
float therefore to initialize a float variable use the suffix f or f as in the following example double however if you want an int number to be treated as double use the suffix d or d for example decimal if you want a numeric real literal to be treated as decimal use the suffix m or m for example my advice you should really determine which type you ll actually be needing to use prior to using it
it s an anti-pattern to send inline closures as a prop to a subcomponent since they ll be recreated for each render forcing a re-render of the subcomponent too since the props will have changed
for the sake of the people that will bump into this topic in the future here s how i solved it i had to set a width height of the scrollarea way less than the width height of the workspace element
instead you can have multiple entity forms security role can be used to show hide for different teams
for more information i d recommend googling google-chrome developer tools or firefox developer tools depending on your browser
font-size become equals to 50px when the screen width is more than or equals to 720px

if you give it 100 height that some element up the dom hierarchy must have fixed width for this to work
looking through dask documentation it says there that generally speaking dask.dataframe groupby-aggregations are roughly same performance as pandas groupby-aggregations. so unless you re using a dask distributed client to manage workers threads etc. the benefit from using it over vanilla pandas isn t always there
given integer conversion rules of the language the shown expression would appear to be well-defined if the type of 5 were a signed type of no larger size than unsigned long long and in that case the pointed element would be
here s ten small reasons to prefer moshi over gson upcoming kotlin support
to solve this problem at least one literal should be made double instead of int
a simple branch assignment is way cheaper than addition and division
like this i get what i what in google-chrome but in firefox it works strange. in firefox when slide is moving image is not fixed
a for-loop has three parts an initialization a condition and a block to be executed after loops
in this example you resize the returned image to fit in a 100px by 100px box the aspect ratio is maintained so 100px is either the height or width whichever is greater in the source

for example fancy and easy-reading result can be achieved with purrr package and tidyverse
macos is based on bsd unix which is way older than linux
i can t really figure out why either. if the concern is double-initialization the swift compiler knows if when and where i call designated super or self initializers so it knows whether i m done initializing this instance. if the concern is that i haven t yet called a designated initializer then it should be fine because i d just be making this instance a reference to the other one 2 vars 1 pointer . if the concern is that concurrent access might have caused self to already be initialized.
i couldn t figure out on how to pass variables with type string in swift controller files and pass it to object written in objective-c
i have also checked to see the contents of the _post array in the 2nd file to see if i am receiving data in a format other than a post request like a string that might have to be exploded to get the contents but the _post array comes up empty. this is the output i get when it redirects to the 2nd page array array the _post and _get for testing purpose arrays come up empty

use something like then you can loop over the list and apply each operation to two entities like the key point is that the actual properties value type is handled within each biconsumer but is not part of the generic signature anymore and therefore doesn t need to be declared for accessor
this seems a better solution as multiplication is much faster than division better accuracy as multiplying with a power-of-2 number is exact so i d like to create a small utility function which has a logic like this by i mean exponentiation this function should return a normalized scaler scalerreciprocal both are power-of-2 numbers where scaler is near to value and scalerreciprocal is the reciprocal of scaler
just like properties can have explicit getter and setter events can have explicit add and remove handlers there s no way an outside class can directly access the underlying onaction3 field through the onaction3 event just as you cannot directly access the onaction2 field through the onaction2 property

client - port 80 aws elb cannot be changed - nginx - reverse proxy - apache when blog is request its proxy passed to however after the reverse proxy happens the url is http and not https
this behavior is why tcp exists because each individual packet can go through separate routes between servers and there is a high chance of out-of-order messages and most applications prefer the ease-of-mind of a strict ordering. other protocols such as plain old paxos can work with out-of-order messages but are typically much slower than raft
however i know this can be solved by try-catch ing the exception-handling and moderating what to throw in that matter but that would involve a lot of code

when the height of element is smaller we can align but when the height is bigger and reach the minimum defined by the parent there is nothing to align and the overal height of the parent may increase if we keep increasing the height of childs you may also note that you are applying width 100 on the a which will have no effect on inline element but will apply to inline-block making each element to be placed on a different line
the instance created in parent component can be shared with children component
note that strdup also uses heap memory behind the scenes so the returned pointers must also be passed to free when you re done with them to avoid memory leaks
performance note for larger data sets you may find int indexing more efficient than boolean indexing if efficiency is a primary concern see efficiently return the index of the first value satisfying condition in array

getting the width is doable by subtracting the scrollbar width from the available screen width getting the height is slightly more complicated because we need to take into account the browser ui tabs address bar bookmarks so far this seems to work until .
chars 0 s binary representation occupies 16 bit 0000 0000 0011 0000 while int 0 s binary representation occupies 32 bit 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 when you sum a chars and an int the chars will be promoted to int first
chars 5 s unicode is 0035 in binary 0000 0000 0011 0101 it will be promoted to int by inserting 16 zeros at head 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 0101 and the int represents 53 in decimal
the only solution i found edit similar to this one was to import in my framework s umbrella header every objective-c header that should be exposed to swift and then make these headers public
if the browser s width is bigger than the image s original width the image s width and height should be enlarged proportionally together with its container - thus pushing downwards the page s contents that appear under the image
this is a pretty straight forward piece of code so you need to find what logic get the max in that which is this logic now how can you make it the min well is greater and is less so would do the trick kind of there is a bug but is confusing because you call the var max personally i would re-write like this
in follow-up to phuclv comment i checked the code generated by jit 1 the results are as follows for variable 5000 division by constant for variable variable because division always takes longer than multiplication the last code snippet is less performant

i would like to present you with some arguments protecting protected fields in java you may favor accessing base class members using protected fields over public accessors in situation where you need to avoid value validation . however if this is not the case then private fields with public accessors should be used to compliment hermetization
basically i want to loop through a couple of images in a folder and add the correct class to the image depending on if the image is in landscape or portrait mode if the width is bigger than the height and vice versa
i ve refactored some legacy code within spring boot 2.1.2 system and migrated from java.util.date to java.time based classes jsr310
autosize does not allow the max to be equal or less than the minimum then it isn t auto sizing anyway
most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be unless the jquery.color plugin is used and also considering that the shorthand css properties font background border are not fully supported. you need a plugin to make the border color transition the border-color property is ignored by .animate method. for example try this 2.7kb minified
specification says variables may be marked transient to indicate that they are not part of the persistent state of an object so if you really want to go by the book you should not write them
the point is that keras performance is much better than tensorflow code

upgrade to the latest versioning which is more c++11 c++14 compliant than vs 2015 update 3
the value of output is unchanged by concatena so you print an uninitialized char crash or any other undefined behavior you need to make output an output var so etc like that i also fixed your malloc you missed 1 char for the null terminator warning if output is not set and you still print it not initialized you need to set it to null and test that case before to printf it or more probably to replace by else this is what i did above note also dim_input1 and dim_input2 have the same value it is useless to distinguishes them and the first call of copy_string can be replaced by strcpy and the second by strcat except that copy_string miss to add a final null character
using bash built-ins is always more efficient than spawning separate subshell s to invoke utilities to accomplish the same thing
if we use as a mask to get all of the bits that are larger than an unsigned short with we get a 0 if uint_with_unknown_content fits into an unsigned short
because soapui takes more than a second to respond the jmeter requests are held open for this time
however these are less specific than f int float since int can be widened to long and double and float can be widened to double
next step is using dropdown list to select between lattice ggplot2 plot and finally i d like to click download it and get it. unfortunately every time i do try to download it i receive a blank markdown page
if you are seeing it on ubuntu the reason is probably you have a pre-installed version of google-chrome and firefox which is older
12.8 sec implementing the arrays manipulation right where needed use for-loop it takes 60 less time 4.7 sec vs

i have 2 docker containers one with nginx using ssl 443 and one with java spring api which also needs to be exposed on https 8443
i have a pair of drop downs one meant to be a minimum value the other a max value with values between 0-12 and a default of select value there is two sets of validation i m running on these the first that there is a value selected in them only accepts 0-12 and the min value is lower than max
keep in mind that double variables can hold numbers of much greater magnitude than int variables so the loss of data may be considerable
i ve tested various ways to manage my project dependencies in python so far installing everything global with pip saves spaces but sooner or later gets you in trouble pip virtualenv or virtualenv a bit of a pain to manage but ok for many cases pipenv pipfile a little bit easier than virtualenv virtualenv but slow and some vendor-lock virtual envs hide somewhere else than the actual project folder conda as package and environment manager great as long as the packages are all available in conda mixing pip conda is a bit hacky poetry - i haven t tried this one .
query the max set its key to minus infinity or some value less than the min element and repeat to read out the elements in descending sorting order
basically the int will be promoted to double since the type of 0.5 is double it s not float and the computation will happen there then the result will be truncated back down to uint8_t
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
loose the tf.reset_default_graph and you should be good. as for the memory leaks be sure you are running keras 2.2.4 and preferably tensorflow 1.10 has better keras integration i had a similar issue with keras 2.2.2 crashing when loading multiple models in sequence and it disapeared after i updated to keras 2.2.4
i see that openmpi uses tcp ip as default protocol for communication which is considered slower than udp when synchronous communication is not required
by either i providing a command line argument to mpirun or by ii building openmpi from source with additional flags related to udp or iii possibly there is another protocol support for faster communication than tcp
and anyway bufferedreader is faster than filechannel atleast to read the ascii files and to keep the code simple we continued using bufferred reader itself

low power levels are also useful for limiting detection range but this is more reliably handled with minimum rssi thresholds on the receiving side because leaving the transmitter at max power provides a higher signal to noise ratio and more reliable detections
the keyboard has a landscape and portrait mode based on a minimum width or if the width is greater than the height
division by a constant can be replaced by multiplication by the reciprocal of the constant for floating point operations
i tried about every hack that was mentioned on so yet the string height gets more inaccurate the smaller the width gets the calculated height is larger than the actual height
use a for f loop to catch the output of a command note if there are more than one folder bin within the tree this will give you the last finding only dir s b ad d f0 f1 f2 bin will recursively s list all folder ad named bin below d f0 f1 f2 in b are format b
i am facing so many issues after upgrade the angular versioning then after i update the webpack to webpack 4
you may be familiar with this aesthetics from plotting lines and polygons but in gganimate it takes a more central place
division is inherently iterative unlike multiplication where you can make wide hardware that does the partial products and partial additions in parallel
so this is evaluated as note that this behavior is different from most programming languages where unary negation has higher precedence than multiplication and division vb javascript
you can get measured height and width like below
as i see you use intervention image so you can try with that you tell intervention to create an image and choose to fit the square as per width if your image s width is bigger than height or per height if your image s height is bigger than width
the resulting archive can not be extracted using gunzip or tar
edit this issue appears to be isolated to firefox - in google-chrome ie it works exactly as expected
it is also possible to test if a certain percentage of the screen width height is smaller than a length in pixels
i also tried using chart.renderer.image to add the svg image and managed to position it well but can t make the image responsive chart will be viewed on tablet and mobile devices in addition to computer screens
but i ve certainly found that string manipulation via ssis script component was much faster than using charindex substr etc via sql
now given a user s name i would like to get the post details of all the post that a given user might have created or post that were shared to him her
on a mobile device in portrait mode width is smaller than height
use aes - using des isn t any easier than aes
you can get the image name from its src attribute which can be obtained using attr
this is mostly a concern when processing requests is computationally heavy - which is something to avoid - if a request needs to perform some heavy computation it s a good idea to move it a background job using a library like can t be used on jruby since it does not support forking threads the configured amount of threads will be run for each worker process - meaning if you have workers x and threads y then you are getting a total of request processing threads share memory so they have smaller memory footprint even though there are gotchas here as well on mri which is the default ruby implementation threads do not allow for executing ruby code in parallel due to the gil - this should not be a big concern as the gil is not locked during waiting on io which is where a lot of the execution time will be spent - accessing the database communicating with apis etc
i found hive over hdfs is faster than hive over hbase

my protractor config contains the following if i comment out the google-chrome capability line as shown above firefox does not get run - google-chrome still runs
i m using http but i need https so i assume if i get ssl certificate and configure tomcat accordingly suddenly all my pages will now be dispalyed as https .
it s quite often a humongous folder and it would be cumbersome to push pull it each time
whereas in python a for-loop is more of a for each loops - you give it an iterable object and it runs the code for every item in that iterable object
the conda documentation explicitly mentions this issue in their troubleshooting documentation conda upgrade error cause downgrading conda from 4.6.1 to 4.5.x and then trying to conda install conda or conda upgrade conda will produce a solving and upgrade error similar to the following solving environment failed condaupgradeerror this environment has previously been operated on by a conda versioning that s newer than the conda currently being used
the code i tried - this prints out duplicates like i want to assign the values to variables and those to be assigned to prometheus metrics
however i still not satisfied with the workaround approach and invite more simple and straight approach to solve the proble m consisting txt file with comma spaces and semicolons while semicolon is to be treated as delimiter try this is the result input output
finally as you do a waitpid it is not necessary to retain the child pid and call waitpid you can simply call wait 2 as you only create a single child and you can trust that wait 2 will give an error if the child finally could not be created the fork call didn t succeed also returnstatus is composed of more info than just the exit 2 value from the child process so comparing it with 0 is not the proper way to check how did it go in the child
an architecture that makes sense in flutter is as follows a top-level stateful widget stateful works better for hot reload a stateless one can cause issues something like myapp but change my to the name of the actual app
it s because you bind ellipse width to the actualheight and since your window isn t square but wide rectangle height value is bigger than width so is not enough wide place to fit square
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition
in a case you need different instances for different cases - you can create a singleton wrapper which will contain all required instances with correspondent name irepository will be registered as transient but wrapper as singleton whenever you need one of those instances you will inject a wrapper as a dependency and use required instances through well-named property because di need to know how to instantiate different instances of same class we need to create some workaround
i find rspec s syntax and support for all the different tests model view controller feature helper services etc very clear and easy to implement also mocking and stubbing is relatively trivial compared to minitest and also rspec has a large fanbase from the rails community.but when building a gem i advice using minitest since it s the official test suite but in testing large and complex codes rspec makes it easier imo
get put are of o 1 concurrentskiplistmap more operations than just get put like sorted top bottom n items by key get last entry fetch traverse whole map sorted by key etc
as an addition if the output would have gone to stderr whats not the case here you would still see it in the terminal because the pipe | only redirects stdout if you don t specify otherwise the rest goes unfiltered to the terminal
the ugly the simplest way to do it for the schedule is to put the following in your jenkinsfile in blueocean every branch and every pull request counts as its own job -- so if you follow standard git workflow the above code will create no less than three cron jobs the feature branch you push even though it hasn t been merged the pull request branch whether or not you merge it the master branch if when you merge the feature branch there is no way to undo this damage unless you push more commits to the feature branch and keep the pull request open under the same number -- otherwise you will be configuring a different job than the one with the cron script
you need to have a variable max and for every word inputted check if it s greater than the max then change the max to the new word and same for the min don t forget to check if min is still then change it to first word also you need a counter to count the length of all words inputted and a counter for the number of words that has been inputted to calculate average word length in the end and to output them as string 1 hey string 2 hello world etc.. you need to do like this
maven expects every dependency to be listed with maven coordinates groupid artifactid version in the pom.xml
after further testing i realized any double that i cast to an int that is greater than integer.max_value just makes the int equal to integer.max_value. for example after further testing i realized if you try to cast a long to an int it seems to assign the int to a seemingly random number
dask arrays are mostly api compatible with pandas and support parallel execution for apply

it looks like this is data you could flatten using a for-loop the inner loops is a more generalized approach to using something like which would be more specific to your problem
..then one approach can be set max + min significant bit s in java

since your dictionary key is a string string.gethashcode is o n depending on the length of the string and dictionary perf can be hurt by hash-collision
there is never never any reason whatsoever to square-bracket an int literal it s nothing more than a rather roundabout way to turn an int literal into a double since worksheet numeric values are variant double which is much better off done with an explicit conversion debug.print typename cdbl 42 double ...or even with a gasp type hint debug.print typename 42# double

b. the virtualbox versioning runs on osx as well with virtualbox installed there whereas there was never an official ise versioning for osx macos - but you need to run the installation after download on a windows machine first - and then transfer the virtualdisk to osx - c. the virtualbox ise for win10 is made for spartan6 only - it looks like there are spartan3 files too but if you start making a project then you will see lots of files are missing for spartan3 - but you can create a tar file from ise_ds ise spartan3 from the native package and restore it in the virtualbox - and xilinx said that the virtualbox has some spartan6 files which the native package doesn t have - same here - use tar to transfer between environments - d. unfortunately oracle linux 6 has some older tools such as gcc binutils etc - in most cases that does not matter - but some fpga projects like walter s pdp11 70 require uptodate tools - in this case check out the oracle linux rhel centos 6 to 7 inplace upgrade path - the xilinx license which comes with the virtualbox is tied to the ethernet address - whereas for the native versioning we need to get a license at xilinx website with your personal log in e. some people have problems on win10 with the programming devices driver not working depending on your hardware digilent adept might be an alternative f. the virtual box has host-only network after install - but you can easily change settings to share host s network connection and reach the internet to clone from github or get updates i hope this helps a bit for orientation - after transferring the missing spartan3 files from the native package into my virtual box i run 97 of my projects on win10 or osx using the virtualbox ise - which i upgrade to ol 7.6 ymmv
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
it s complex but basically long has a higher rank than int and int has a higher rank than chars
the integer promotions are if a type is wider 1 than unsigned int it is not changed
this is too big for a 16 bit int but not a 16 bit unsigned int so each is multiplied by 1u to force the values to be converted to unsigned int as per the usual arithmetic conversions specified in section 6.3.1.8 the integer promotions are performed on both operands
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
because it s impossible to analyze all the subclassing the base class is fragile in the sense that any change in it may lead to unexpected changes of behavior in subclasses. to protect against this problem effective java by joshua bloch addison-wesley 2008 one of the best-known books on good java programming style recommends that you design and document for inherited or else prohibit it. this means all classes and methods that aren t specifically intended to be overridden in subclassing need to be explicitly marked as final . kotlin follows the same philosophy
you might get better results with dateadd datepart number date
here is one of the correct ways for calculating the bounding box based on his answer this way you ensure the minimum is always lower than the maximum you can also change things when you re querying based on min and max but i figured this is simpler

if you want to re-run expo build then you ll need to upgrade from sdk 25 preferably to sdk 32 so you won t need to update again for a while and also because each expo versioning is better than the last
well this while loops is slower because more happens you check two conditions every time you iterate and inside the while block you index a list you do the same check as in the for-loop and you add 1 to i
are there good reasons why the request can t be processed by google-chrome and firefox

requirement given a width and height give me the name of the smallest papersize that is larger than this width and height there is something tricky about this
personally i d go for area size now that you ve defined your comparer your linq is easy give me the name of the smallest paper that is larger than this width and height when concatening linq statements always make sure that only the last statement is the one that does not return ienumerable
and there is no need for your range loops there is a more elegant way to do this in python use a for-loop over all elements of the list
the last block of code loops through the numbers list and compares every number with the current maxnum and minnum variables to see whether that number is greater than the max or less than the min
it appears null can be used for int data types but not double
the apply functions are generally faster than loops and i think you want to use a for-loop not a while loops here anyway
with pull it is less repetitive to use the saved remote and the remote can be tracked by your git client to check if pull or push is needed
if as indicated in your comment to this answer this needs to be modified server-side input#destinations needs to be filled out server-side than simply include that input in the partial-view and read it from there and ignore the code that modifies it client-side

you can perform operations on it more readily such as sorting or filtering
result question i m not very familiar with textkit but i do know the position of the text inside a uilabel is supposed to be decided by baselineoffset or at least something anything but the foregroundcolor of the text.
the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself
upgrade cassandra cluster if you are using lower versioning of cassandra.higher versioning is giving better performance as i am using 3.11.2 and 3.11.3
because the final expression that occurs in a for-loop the i++ here will always be executed after loops body
in short if an operand is an integer that is narrower than an int it undergoes integral promotion as described above to int or unsigned int
regardless of their positions chars should be promoted to int type
google provides a set of geocoding apis that can be used to reverse geocoding but it s slightly more complicated to use but it s much better than geocode
i have different images each one with their own dimensions some presenting more height than width

i would say that auto properties are syntactic sugar over a private field and a properties with get and set accessor which is just more sugar so having get and set value methods
most organizations would have devs push to a branch like feature-a and then open a pull request to master once the code is tested and ready to go out
then i filled it with a md5 encrypt model- id the md5 value is much shorter and because it also uses laravel s crypt it can t be guessed
or you can add a few dummy items.so they can be view with width and height of your normal items.that should do it
but since you defined __init__ in child you have to call parent __init__ method as well for that else parent constructor isn t called prints moritz mustermann to call the parent __init__ method we used parent.__init__ self we could also have used super like this super child self .__init__ which amounts to the same thing here single inheritance so even like super .__init__
depending on whether you want to save or not the state of the qml that you want to hide there are the following alternatives reject the same qquickwidget i recommend changing qquickview to qquickwidget and just change the source
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
text file involved should consist of comma spaces double quote and semicolons while semicolon is to be treated as delimiter
it was straight-forward with matplotlib but not straight-forward with bokeh

according to official flutter website only primitive types can be used int double bool string and stringlist so if you want to store binary data you should consider using sqlflite which is a self-contained implementation of the famous sqllite database for flutter
full example advantages over pointer-to-pointer an actual 2d array that can be allocated free with a single function call and can be passed to functions like memcpy
it seems that it allows you to pick the queue so one should expect high_priority queue to be used when jobs are scheduled by cron and default queue to be used when the same jobs are scheduled by other means other ruby code that is not the cron
i ve attempted to change the field to a string input but i have so many calls to those entered fields that would need to be cast to int that it would seem to me to be far easier if i was able to change the maximum allowable chars in that field to 13
get-childitem server share folder1 succeeds set-location server share folder1 fails edit evidently it is possible to use set-location on directory lower than folder 1
so basically using exception-handling to return value should be avoided because exception-handling implementation is optimized assuming they are used for error-handling and not for returning values hence they might be inefficient for that
so this is useful if you are doing a for-loop but do not know if the element will be found in loops returned true in loops
example let _types be deduced to int double float then the expression will be expanded unfolded to you cannot simply erase the

in a nutshell get should be used when get ting stuff and post ing when you need to change stuff on the server side
instead pass strncpy the size of the buffer or one more than the strlen str
see here if i look in their documentation on localization it appears that billing address fields can be customised different translation
similarly casting it to int32_t or uint32_t will result in a sign-extension from signed chars to the 32-bit wide value 0xffffffff if you cast to unsigned chars like in instead then the unsigned chars 0xff will be promoted to int using zero extension 4 therefore the result will be exactly the same as in summary when in doubt consult the standard
first i thought i may use delim_whitespace true in read_csv method this helps when you have more than one spaces as delimiter

the right way to look at pushgateway imho is like yet another scraping endpoint . this means that it will not aggregate the metrics you pushing and will just hold them as-is . but you actually do not need it to be aggregated - prometheus will scrape the data from pushgateway and all your data will be available in the prometheus
should be declare in for-loop and adapter is outside of loops
i normally prefer beautifulsoup with lxml parser for parsing xml. sample code below output you can then use the methods provided by beautifulsoup like find and find_all to find the corresponding node or subnodes
queries that hit tables that have not been read before will cause data to be read from disk while tables that are already pre-loaded to page cache will be much faster as they are fetched from ram

some details i builded and trained a u-net model on keras and used a method from some user on github that converts a trained keras model into a .pb file which can be reloaded on tensorflow and runned for inference user
it is this line the takeaway is that something with a width of 100 and a margin will end up being more than 100 width of the page
in grafana 5.3 they introduced for prometheus that s easier to use this variable represents the range for the current dashboard
dask dataframe developers recommend using pandas when feasible
if your union share a common property with distinct values you can use discriminated union like mateuszkocz suggests
from what i can see there are 2 problems with your app.api.call you got the first argument wrong it should never be get but instead it should be read for get requests update for put requests delete for delete requests and create for post requests
the function could be defined as int calculate int a chars op int b with your calculation a op1 b op2 c you would first have to check the precedence of the operators op1 and op2 to decide if you calculate a op1 b op2 c or a op1 b op2 c
the function could be defined as int precedence chars op then you could do something like this in the program from the question you might want to use instead of return calculate .
well the answer is that if you are going to load the sortedlist up-front the insertions will be slower but because array indexing is faster than following object links lookups are marginally faster than a sorteddictionary
i saw that in dart there is a class duration but it cant be used add subtract years or month
if your dependency properties can be set by inherited and you care about that you can check
if column a is sorted then you could also use copied down this would be faster than using countif within the same formula referring to error 1004 s answer countif and sumifs all need to look at the range so having two of these in the same formula will consume twice as much resources but it has the advantage that it doesn t require column a to be sorted

the abstract_class properties is more or less a way to subclassing models without invoking sti single table inherited
in general i think tensorboard is much more suited for monitoring rather than analysis as the primary goal of tensorboard is to make it easier to understand debug and optimize tensorflow programs
gstreamer instead of the function used for simulating the mic-phone audio for this program i have created pipelines which are the audio file can be changed to flac or mp3 with changing appropriate elemnets in pipeline the process of taking payloads from rtp stream and writing it on file is done in another thread than sending the data to google and reading the response
however i read insomniac games style guide that int should be preferred for-loop counters you should rather be using size_t whenever iterating over an arrays
i just started to learn dart and came across the below code it produces the below output true true false i am not sure why the above output is generated. the above output suggests that all int can be treated as double
my client is using thunderbird to send mails from their machine and from there it goes directly to hostmonster hosted email then out to their federal client who enforces dkim signing and rejects unsigned messages
this is what i do activate your conda virutal env use pip to install into your virtualenv if you face any compatibility issues use conda i recently ran into this when numpy matplotlib freaked out and i used the conda build to resolve the issue
arrays however are special in that they essentially compile into a range-based for-loop which is much faster than using an ienumerable
ffmpeg being built as a command line tool that can take it s input from stdin and output to stdout stderr it is more simple to use these capabilities than to try to have ffmpeg handle the http reading writing
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand then the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
as others have mentioned in the comments try selenium you ll need google-chrome or firefox driver installed here s example with google-chrome to get you started for more instructions see documentation
4 technically the argument should have type int and printf converts it to unsigned chars and prints the chars with that code
for sound quality webm and ogg should be better than mp3
you will find postgresql is much more enterprise-oriented than other products such as mysql

taken from wikipedia in computer programming an integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside of the range that can be represented with a given number of digits either larger than the maximum or lower than the minimum representable value
first for reference here s the data i used we can use used dplyr syntax not mandatory but looks very legible and simple with lubridate functions and perform this operation very simply mdy converts the values to date objects
you can define the function that will be passed to setinterval define a variable to reference setinterval call clearinterval reference if c is equal to 0
it should also be noted that md5 is a very weak hash function also collisions have been found two different plaintext values result in the same hash just use a random value for plaintext
int can only be combined with int of the same class or scalar double
in this case it doesn t need to do the conversion into an objective-c block because swift closures can be passed into objective-c and used as objective-c objects directly
a priorityqueue needs to be populated with comparable elements or else be supplied with a comparator when constructed
rbenv - can be installed with homebrew rvm to check that you re now using the non-system version of ruby you can run the following commands which ruby it should be something other than usr bin ruby ruby -v it should be something other than 2.3.7
so to call the method in objective c above in first time we got a pointer to navigationcontroller. using that we are calling the poptorootviewcontrolleranimated method inside the uinavigationcontroller class with parameter value yes in objective-c yes is for true and no is for false the same thing above can be written in swift as similar to scenario in objective-c the above written syntax is in swift

i could perhaps have used sudo -s or similar but the second problem was that i had to enter my root passwd for every package that was built
although depending how your inputs were written using 32-bit xor could be better than 16-bit xor maybe avoiding partial-register stalls if something later reads the full 32 or 64bit registers
i made some changes to let it work removed second for-loop used condition instead of reversing the arrays looping only to the half of the arrays if the half match the full match too here is the snippet

all in all there is a reason why pytorch keras is more readable and sanity-preserving than tensorflow
or if you are not familiar with perl tk have more familiarity with actual tcl tk syntax or familiar with wrappers for languages tkinter for python a better option might be tkx
and it seems to be the case here the type returned by uint8_c possibly unsigned chars in disguise has smaller rank than int and so you end up having a signed type
systemd if there is better solution than writing daemons please let me know
use unsigned chars for buffer you can also for header to avoid problem if your chars are signed and give a negative value you compare with int like 0x89 where the bit 7 is set you also have a problem for png because the values for png are 0x89 0x50 0x4e 0x47 0x0d 0x0a 0x1a 0x0a there are not ended by 0 like in all the other cases this is needed because your algorithm need to find 0 to indicate you found just add a column to also have 0 also for png
if you really insist you can use np.isclose to get a boolean array indicating whether each float element is close enough to it s floored int counterpart and those might be castable without too big loss in precision would give you meaning second and third element could be casted
after the installation there are around 2800 scripts that should be run to upgrade the database
in the sample you ve provided i would recommend getting a cgsize with for each visible label making sure to take the margin between items into acount and determining if the total height is greater than the constant height you ve assigned to the stack view
strcspn can be used like strtok with the set of delimiters to provide the length of the current token found to ensure strstr didn t match your search term as a lesser-included-substring of a longer word like tree in trees then it becomes a simple matter of looping with strstr and validating the length of the token with strcspn and then just applying one of the three cases above
set a parent container width that can be no larger than the width of the viewport center all header content try not to set explicit height on elements
separately you should note that some of your jsx code in particular the tags in customnavbar.js are using a prop class - these should be changed to classname or else react will complain
if the value is bigger than min and smaller than max it is a valid number

the 501 packet seems to be generated by libavformat rtsp.c ff_rtsp_read_reply when ffmpeg receive a malformed rtsp packet with method null status_code 0. i don t know why such packets arrive at random timing and who is wrong maybe the camera maybe any of network switches or routers in the middle of the network path from the camera to the server machine . but anyway i don t want the recording to be stopped due to those malformed packets
if your script runs once a second with the same parameters configuration then you ll probably lose some of the metrics because multiple scripts may terminate within the same second all push their metrics and only the last one s metrics will get collected by prometheus as i believe you can t set a collection interval lower than 1 second in prometheus
it seems your delimiter is more than one spaces

im not familiar with ionic and your angular setup but there is a similar position fixed bug in safari browsers
the easier way is to use the function strncpy which is more secure than just using strcpy
no chars is automatically promoted to int or unsigned int so in there is no overflow while an int as at least 14 bits 97 and 98 are promoted from chars in positive int whatever the fact a chars is signed or not while a chars has more than 7 bits
then take a look in this example this can be done using for-loop too but i really recommend the while loops to this case
in any case in jquery we can use checked for checkbox radio button so you can do above or for example
you probably thought you needed the - 1 there since arrays index s start at 0 except since the for-loop is less than and not less than or equal to it will end at the last index
it s probably better to just use post instead though since some servers don t allow mutations to be sent as get requests
is const unsigned chars the pointer has been dereferenced and any type narrower than int gets promoted to int on variadic parameter lists printf is defined as
spring docs - as a rule of thumb you should use the prototype scope for all beans that are stateful while the singleton scope should be used for stateless beans
okay joni s comment is the answer i thought about hex2bin just as a way to make hex-encoded string readable and i didn t realize it compresses the hex value to a string which is short enough to be stored as binary
and by the way python doc recommends using virtualenv because pyenv was deprecated
double is more widened type than int

even more strange but still not a real compiler bug if you pass the -32 value as 7th or later variadic argument it may be expanded to 64bit and the output on x64 linux is 0xffffffffffffffe0 -32 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0xffffffffffffffe0 -32 0xffffffffffffffe0 -32 however the output on x64 windows is something like 0xffffffffffffffe0 -32 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00000000ffffffe0 4294967264 0x00040800ffffffe0 1134700294832096 0x178bfbffffffffe0 1696726761565323232 0x00007ff6ffffffe0 140698833649632 0x00007ff6ffffffe0 140698833649632 the reason here is that in the 64bit x86 calling conventions a number of leading arguments 6 in system v amd64 abi 4 in microsoft x64 is passed via cpu registers and only subsequent arguments are passed via the stack
since printf is variadic it can t check the types of its arguments so a chars passed to printf will get promoted to int when the function is called
i d also like the output to be redirected to stdout instead of stderr because the logging framework we use treats all stderr content as high-priority errors
dividing an unsigned chars by another unsigned chars is faster than divisions involving unsigned int
c if no l length modifier is present the int argument is converted to an unsigned chars and the resulting chars is written. if an l length modifier is present the wint_t argument is converted as if by an ls conversion specification with no precision and an argument that points to the initial element of a two-element array of wchar_t the first element containing the wint_t argument to the lc conversion specification and the second a null wide character. c 2011 online draft so f printf expects the argument corresponding to the c conversion specifier to have type int and will convert it to unsigned chars before formatting and displaying
both functions need the index of the element to be replaced and because of this i would recommend using for-loop instead of foreach using lset would be another way you could do it is to find the index of the element that you need to change using lsearch in which case you won t need a loops
however when there s a few layers of indirection and a function starts returning an iqueryable instead of ienumerable it gets harder
you can use your angular component for managing the modal and show it if it could be needed or hide it if it s not

you also are missing the on clause on your first join a full join is not necessary as a left join to your catalog table covers what you need coalesce is sql iso standard but as you are comparing only two values and you are using sql server isnull is better to perform that operation use two left joins or you can use union all
ok beautifulsoup seems way better than raw lxml for that purpose this code works pretty well edit it is important to use html.parser
with the help of this post i found a solution with one shortcoming the shortcoming is that tblnew contains one record which needs to be deleted to get an empty table
the best practice is use nginx as reverse proxy to apache. by this you can use apache to listen on port 80 and setup let s encrypt on nginx so the ssl traffic will be handled by nginx
this basically loops through the whole arrays and is much easier than a for-loop
c strings can be copies with strcpy char arrays that do not have a null terminator should be copied with memcpy or memmove
i ve come across an error when converting int.max to a double then back to int print int double int.max and getting the following error fatal error double value cannot be converted to int because the result would be greater than int.max i d be appreciated if you can explain me the the reason of the above error
i do that work manually i want to do that in for-loop i known the elements of var_list can be called inside loops as but how can i call list in such way where all variables list with same name and different in numbers
for a pop-up it is better to use a dialog than a whole new javafx window
taking a bit of a leap of faith here in assuming that the max value for each analysis group is what you want to plot as the upper end of the error bar the min value is the lower end of the error bar and what is left over should be the median
my problem is that while merging the password with the salt my hash password gets shorter by one character at the end
here is a list of me thinking through the problem and trying to pseudo code it inputs tree data from above parenttitle from clicked item in dom outputs tree with item inserted steps determine highest used id to know what next unique id is check current level of data for match with the title of parent if matched then set id and parent_id in new data and push into children of parent if no match then check if current level data have children if current level has children needs to repeat steps 2+ for each until match is found here is my code so if a user typed cat while clicking the add button for dog then a new object would be inserted into children of the first level dog object in the data tree
as the question mention my horizontal scrollbar is not working i am working on a react app i am trying to build a small tabledata component here is my rendered jsx code i know it is so much code but it is repeated code i will explain in details what i want to achieve here is my sass file as you can see in my sass file i am trying to add the horizontal scrollbar to the div with co-table__long class but it is not working that div had its children and their total width is more than 700px and i fixed my parent width to 300 px so i can see the horizontal scrollbar
but with for avx1 then running the code on skylake this running scalar 64bit is actually still slightly faster than 128bit avx auto-vectorized asm from njuffa s code
we have to mask anyway for widths lower than 16-bit sse avx doesn t have byte-granularity shifts only 16-bit minimum. benchmark results on arch linux i7-6700k from njuffa s test harness with this added
but all of them are just plain scalar with clang and icc unrolling by 2
the specification says that unsigned integer values can only be copied to unsigned integer values
the expressions cos + pi 2.0 ang and sin + pi 2.0 ang could optionally be replaced with sin - ang and cos ang respectively
it will be called server-side once on the first request to the nuxt app and client-side when navigating to further routes
with ggpubr i don t know why but if i set the guide for another aesthetics the legend title position do not change it s a good question to be made for ggplot2 experts
you will also need to create a token can be done server-side via https or client-side via js
it works by using the fact that boolean can be converted to int false 0 true -1 to count the number of true expressions
if your app uses #2 javascript events you can use a workaround triggering the mouseover mouseout events manually cy.get .menu.button.overlay_button.projects_popover .click cy.contains automation .trigger mouseover cy.contains shots .trigger mouseover .click there is also a possibility your app is listening to the mouseenter mouseleave events in which case you can trigger those as well
udp bob i love u amy received ovi l e tcp is more reliable than udp with even message order guaranteed that s no doubt why udp is more lightweight and efficient
also 64-bit multiplying was slightly slower on some cpus and 64-bit division is significantly slower than 32-bit even on current intel cpus

if you upgrade your ember versioning ember-cli-babel may not have been upgrade at the same time just install the latest stable release ember install ember-cli-babel
also i adjust the size of the qdockwidget during the use of the .ui however as soon as i interact with the .ui using a qpushbutton or using a qcheckbox the qdockwidget gets bigger again the expected behavior is the one below which it does not increase dimension abruptly during the interaction with the .ui but rather remains in position as below below is the most important part of the code i am using for this project and i signed the 3 debugging errors notified by the compiler with if that can be useful mainwindow.cpp qdockresizeeventfilter.h and finally qfluidgridlayout.h i have been reading about this issue frequently here and in this post
based on cook s theorem any np problem can be converted to sat in polynomial time i know that sat is a np-complete problem
data can be related one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many
for example if the tested sentence was this is a sentence that is much longer than eight words but only the first eight words will be outputted. the output would be this is a sentence that is much longer if i added punctuation that the function looks for to change the input to this is a sentence

all words greater than 3 characters should be translated to the words bingo capitalization must be maintained punctuation within words we ll can be discarded all other punctuation must be maintained
the following expression gives you the starting position of the version number 9 is just the length of string version plus the surrounding spaces charindex version user_agnt_str + 9 then you can compute the position of the next comma after that position which signals the end of the version number charindex user_agnt_str charindex version user_agnt_str + 9 both information can now be used with substr substr user_agnt_str charindex version user_agnt_str + 9 charindex user_agnt_str charindex version user_agnt_str + 9 - charindex version user_agnt_str - 9 demo on db fiddle user_agnt_str | version ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ http_user_agent mobile 4.2.95 version 2.3.1 build 95 iphone 65
sort the data by some unique identifier i recommend using heapsort as it s in-place generic in that you can provide a comparison function and it will work with that and you could probably look up an iterative implementation in python
instead it returns special number values to notify you doing math on them always results in that specific value again so you can just check for them at the end of an arithmetic chain nan operation could not be done infinity number was too large -infinity number was too small for all those three special cases you can use isfinite to check against also be aware that javascript numbers are floating point with a precise integer range between -2 53 2 53 every integer outside of that will lose accuracy
i search for a library preferably python go node.js java from which i can take sip calls make sip calls having multiple sip call at the same time. have access to the rtp audio to be able to redirect received rtp to another rtp server
albeit it would induce some overhead to spawn the new webdriver browser client combination but that may provide the much needed cushion from cpu and memory usage as discussed in limit google-chrome headless cpu and memory usage selenium using too much ram with firefox incase the tests are not independent and the tests are based on the same session cookies etc parameters reusing the same webdriver browser client makes sense
when the user adds children that occupy more space than the parent could afford the div needs to be added automatically to the next div and if any of the child divs are deleted then the overflowing div needs to be added back to the 1st paper

this will move the bottom quarter of the values to the top call quart again to find the quartile of the new values which will be the median of the original values iterate through the array and subtract max - min + 1 from all values greater than the max to return the array to its original state you might need some additional rules to handle special cases if there are multiple values equal to the quartile
so an ilist is a more specific type of an icollection which is a more specific type of an ienumerable
for that give every item the weight of 1 using this way every view will be given same width and height. note but for to be applied you have to make every item in the recycler view s width and height match_parent
maybe i can use hash tables but i don t know if this is a feature of racket only or it can be used with scheme also
also with setinterval and settimeout it s better to provide a function reference than to provide a string of executable code as the first argument
if i hard coded the token without value it works and managed to be deployed on wildfly server jboss
you can do it with a while loops but the for-loop is less error-prone i think
this is called a strength-reduction optimization because addition is a weaker slightly cheaper operation than multiplication
there are 3 approaches you can go duplicate your html elements and show hide them accordingly display items as flex columns and set fixed height to make it wrapped use column-count option 1 duplicate elements the easiest solution would be to duplicate your #2 and #4 onto your left column
it can be enabled in ubuntu debian based distros under
so i ended up using a relational database anyway since only there i could use compound keys without any hacks . i performed a benchmark to compare sqlite with postgresql and mysql - 500 000 inserts of 60 kb blobs and then 50 000 selects by the whole key
note but checksums are not as unique as hash like md5 sha ..
for example for employee 127 first job and second job number is same and second and third row is different then the first and second row will be returned with minimum fromdate and max todate and third row will be returned as is
since you need some way to recognise in one getchar function if you read regular chars or if function tells you there is nothing more to read - someone long time ago decided to use int so that some value bigger than chars can be returned to indicate end of file
you should use .css on jquery object change to though i prefer using show hide instead of setting the style property. you can check the event.target.nodename to show hide the element

your program is creating a range of numbers between 1 and 19 range go to one less than the max number you specify like your program is initializing the variable total to equal 0 for i in a you start looping through the range you made earlier the first iteration the next and so on until you are selecting only the data where the modulo of 5 or 3 is 0
xcode 10 s release notes weak linking against frameworks that are not present in simulator runtimes older than ios 12.0 tvos 12.0 and watchos 5.0 yet are present in macos mojave can cause an app to crash on launch when running in those older simulator runtimes
you can do the proper calculations to set bm the height equal to the container and adjust width in the case bm width to height ratio is less than container width to height ratio or the inverse in the opposite scenario
however if you really need to use maven for that you might use the following pom.xml this is more ore less an equivalent of the build.gradle file
to be able to set fixed width and height to you need to change display inline
i am running python3 django2 with mysql which will be changed to postgresql for live usage and currently have my static files stored inside the virtualenv on my local drive
above number.max_safe_integer for example the precision is less than 0 decimal places to convert a number to a string with a fixed number of decimal places use .tofixed as epascarello suggested as for doing financial calculations some say you should never use ieee 754 floats such as javascript s number s although many of the largest companies in finance do just that
with g++ -o3 default or we get with we get clang works with the at t version but fails with or the which that implies because that apparently only applies to code emitted by llvm not for how the front-end fills in the asm template
since you need to iterate 3 arrays and if 3 car arrays are of same size for-loop is better than for each by using java-8 streams
let s see the example we use the accessor to specify which getter and setter method will be used during serializable and deserialization respectively
in class server in method send you seem to have closed the outputstream dont close it just flush it also in recieve you seem to prematurely close the inputstream apply the above fixes and that should fix your exceptions

the hide class should be defined before show
and i get an error that says lossy conversion between double and int
simple implementation and this is how we can use it above code prints edit during serializable we lose information about type which will be needed during deserialization process
i developed simple type information which will be stored during serializable and used in deserialization
from make install considered harmful in the readme file for googletest and gmock we said that you could install compiled googletest and gmock libraries on nix systems using make install
hence i found instead of using java collection framework - map or set or list if i store data simply in arrays and start parsing data using for-loop it is faster

the current date is 2019-03-19 and the minimum date is set to 2019-04-18 next month however in google-chrome when you click on the date it opens up the native datepicker and it opens up on april with the invalid dates grayed out. datepicker in google-chrome in firefox with versions that support native datepicker however when you first click on the date it opens up the native datepicker and it opens up on the current month march with all the dates grayed out and the user will have to click to the next month in order to see valid dates. datepicker in firefox this becomes a bigger issue if the min date is several months to years from the current date in which case the user must keep clicking to view the next month only to find that they are all unavailable
i know that when you compare two dates the result will always be 0 if equals 1 if the date being compared inside the compareto parameter is older and -1 if the date inside the parameter is more recent
by now math functions as sin cos pow are not included
3 one way is rounding your double value before it will be passed for int initializer to one decimal place and then round result by following rule for this purpose you can use rounded method with floatingpointroundingrule .tonearestorawayfromzero which is default value for this parameter also you can use failable initalizer since if double is bigger then int can be code crashes
in the loop start with minimum value between n and m and increment the i value by one until value is bigger than max of n and m
by now math functions as sin cos pow are not included

you can try firefox for this purpose first download geckodriver from here same could be done with google-chrome you can download google-chrome driver from here no need to setup path variable
be careful because between you ask the next id and when you want to use it someone concurent query can insert a new record and the id you get is no longer valid let s say when you want to add new person record when you didn t know the name want to put newperson get the id write to db newperson but this could happend get1 the id get2 the id write1 to db newperson write2 to db newperson where 1 and 2 are two concurent scripts that happens to execute at the same time easy fix would be to use transactions to avoid this
this can easily be converted to double by replacing int with double throughout the file this uses getline and istringstream to parse the input
the other option would be to manually add another source folder to the build path but that will get lost whenever m2e updates the project configuration from the pom.xml
the value 201 cannot be converted to int because it starts with a double quote chars
the code is also available here it s called testvignettemovebank2018.r when i run the code i get an error from the loop which produces the error message error .data is a corrupt grouped_df the groups attribute must be a data frame this seems to be the result of a recent update to dplyr so that the temp object is no longer one that works with the functions that follow
a udp request is more or less as fast as an icmp request

the integer may be converted to floating-point by the cpu whereas the string is converted digit by digit in an operation that involves floating-point multiplications
so we need to probably make this a function so we can call it at the right place so it needs to happen after all the iterations for the names so maybe call it here just outside and after loops you may need to declare followingnum outside the whole thing then update it instead alternatively just make sure that your if statement is not inside the for-loop

you can use this trick by rick wicklin to count the number of digits in an int for the second and third cases they ll be stored as chars
similar to martin prikryl s answer. in order to deal with different dpi settings and placing a bitmap setup your machine to 100 dpi make a bitmap with size width height to fit on your innosetup page form get these width and height right click properties on your bmp file use the code below setup your machine to 150 dpi and create your bitmap to fit for 150 dpi and use it instead the first one which fits for 100 dpi this way it will look nice for 100 and for 200 the code change 544 with the width of your bitmap and 211 with the height of your bitmap from step 3 stretch true does the bitmap to expand if it is smaller or shrink if it is bigger than width height properties p.s
0 0 6 so minimum k 6 my current approach find the max node and start from it if there is more than one max node the one which comes sooner is chosen i define an array let s call it possible nodes and i add the node found in step 1 to it
for object you can use for-loop map is better use for arrays type
amd seems to have abandoned their cpu opencl implementation and intel claims theirs is only for their brand of processors
google-chrome and other chromium based browsers are known to be more forgiving than firefox and others
try this code.. you can give fixed width and height into dp
i was wondering instead what is the comparison between csv and xlsb given this is faster and smaller than xlsx usually
i uploaded the code to stackblitz and i found in google-chrome i cannot scroll when the mouse is in the field but in firefox i can scroll
at runtime it s not possible as upcasting is always allowed to object and downcasting is always allowed from object in this case as you re targeting a list
in practice this method is not fundamentally different from your multiplying by a large prime approach but in this case the factor is chosen more carefully and the fact that sometimes more than 1 multiplication is required adding to the apparent randomness
the csrf below are not possible with put when the victim visits attackersite.com normal request cookies are sent put is not a supported attribute value xhr request cookies are sent put would trigger a preflight request
i installed python 3.7.2 still pip was not installed for pip there must be pip.exe in folder script in directory where python is installed but in my device there nothing in it
fish is not generally compatible with bash and bash s completion system is quite different from fish s
especially if rows counts thousands. or if you want to keep datagrid there are such ways to decrease loading time as also set fixed width and or height datagrid may try to recalculate required width and height every time there is data updated

let s say we have class car stateless that have inside it two class for now it will be wheel stateful and mask stateful and my job is to whenever state of class wheel is changed call class mask to change it state also with specific data from wheel but parent should have also access to child data
what has been serialized with xstream is not necessarily deserializable with jackson
in airflow source repo one word of caution due to the way logging multiprocessing and airflow default handlers interact it is safer to override handler methods than to extends them by calling super in a derived handler class
i am trying to explain programmatically. extends when you want to extends a subclassing to be extended in inherited that we use java extends. implements when an implements an interface we use the keyword implements
for example you can have this somemodule.js file that contains the following code the for-loop is a blocking operation therefore module.exports will only be invoked once loops is finished
so i understand there are two kinds of servers first kind is web server or http server such as nginx apache caddy another kind is app server such as tomcat undertow
the angular team and many experienced angular developers strongly recommend moving filtering and sorting logic into the component itself
you could use a list comprehension and fetch the values of interest from each dictionary using operator.itemgetter output or if you prefer with map
i m currently trying to remove all business logic from our database model classes so they ll contain nothing more than fields getter and setter
here s a simple numpy implementation of this but in this case our array will have a fixed size 100 instead of tensor this works perfectly for defined constants but in our case n is a tensor so is index_array therefore where k is keras.backend and hence assignment of values in pythonic manner will yield an error typeerror tensor object does not support item assignment in tensorflow question i want to find a way to replicate a code in keras-based backend alone without the use of tf.variable and tf.sparsetensor so that it can be fully compatible with keras
if it calls that function any number less than 10 min or greater than 10 max will be expressed in scientific notation
if the entire range of your colorbar values is less than 10 min or greater than 10 max your colorbar will display the results as requested in the op scientific notation with only mantissas on the sides of the bar and a single exponent at the top
try this will let you compare just the first chars in the string since and comparison works fine on chars s since they can be compared basically like int but is more complicated for string
the range of the type unsigned chars is adequate but i have used int because speed is much more important than memory consumption to me and i thought maybe cpu works with int s faster
the real differences in the semantics of post and put are currently described by rfc 7231 post is the more general method which can be used for any operation on the target resource put is more specific - it indicates that the included document is intended as a replacement for the representation on the server
i understood from similar issues that the version of com.google.firebase firebase-auth should be set to at least 11.6.0 but the version in my app build.gradle is higher 16.0.3 as you can see my app build.gradle dependencies my project build.gradle dependencies classpath com.android.tools.build gradlew 3.3.1 classpath com.google.gms google-services 4.1.0 any help would be appreciated
in order to read the remainder of the line input by the user you can use this function notes c must be defined as int to accommodate for all values of the type unsigned chars and the special negative value eof
besides during the normal and succesful migration i mean before the optional step to convert contents to dexterity i got the following line repeated regularly step collective.z3cform.datetimewidget has an invalid import handler finally this does not seem to be related to dexterity migration since this is true even if i don t install dexterity and keep archetypes content types
ionic vs cordova first of all i would recommend starting with ionic because its better to have with some ui widgets to start with rather than a blank screen cordova and to start from scratch. hybrid apps these are not native apps but rather use webviews browser built-in your app to display your views coded in html and fetch user input and then use javascript or angular etc to process them
a more common approach with cron for this is by simply adding multiple cron jobs and imposing an increasing delay on each of them
subset omits na values and also avoids repeating df which also eliminates na values but df must be repeated the dplyr package s filter is like base subset using sqldf the na values are dropped

we are very familiar with try-catch blocks that we can wrap over a set of code and if an exception-handling occurs then it will handle this exception-handling
from fprintf s docs h specifies that a following d i o u x or x conversion specifier applies to a short int or unsigned short int argument the argument will have been promoted according to the integer promotions but its value shall be converted to short int or unsigned short int before printing
for example any boolean evaluates as less than any int
from glibc csu libc-start.c __libc_start_main we call main with the pointer type the main_auxvec_decl shouldn t be defined on i386 i think only for powerpc
this works because int values can be converted to boolean values
maybe you should just use objectmapper with setting properties accessor to get access to every field result stringvalue null intvalue 0 floatvalue 0.0 booleanvalue false dto --edit for getting values from objects by reflection please write in question what do you want to have in output
the hmac algorithm is more than just hash key followed by message
sometimes the break condition is more natural and sometimes the goto is clearer
you can do this using scikit-learn output note that the output is a square matrix where element i j is the distance between row i and row j this seems to be faster than using scipy s pdist with a custom haversine function
keras sits on top of tensorflow and thus the framework is relatively higher-level than tensorflow itself
since i m not very familiar with swift here s some objective-c sample code load html string get uiviewprintformatter and print
two numbers greater than one multiplying to produce a number greater than one after finding it to be less than one i thought that this might be caused by spreading this value over the total hits in the time range and assuming that the majority of hits would be non-converting and have a quantity of 0 however i checked the numbers and this doesn t add up either
if a decimal fractions is included lower order time elements if any shall be omitted and the decimal fractions shall be divided from the integer part by the decimal sign specified in iso 31-0 the comma or full stop .

another thing is in the event where you re not actually messing with the internals of layers is to just use keras which is much more straightforward to use for the layman than tensorflow and it sits on top of tensorflow so you re using the same tech
since several ws calls have the same outer control structure but different payloads the outer structure is a generic class ideally there would be a jsonalias json_name to put on every attribute and that would be used for serializable deserialization
and on a side note i think lxml is faster than beautifulsoup but it is not as elegant

but if i understood correctly you want to write a program that starts another program passes some pre-defined input to the other program checks if some breakpoint in the other program is hit i don t know if this is possible using gdb but it would be possible to write your own debugger start the program to be tested using fork and one of the exec functions such as execlp before the exec function call ptrace ptrace_traceme 0 0 0 call waitpid
if you re satisfied with its browser support you could try position sticky although i would advise not too as it s still only truly compatible with firefox safari s latest versions
by default it does not handle back actions and it resets routes to their default state when you switching away you can perform goback action inside goalstack if you have more than one screens
the rules for integer promotions will convert any integer with a conversion rank less than int unsigned as well as bit-fields into the an int unsigned

now safari by default is even stricter than google-chrome here and a simple click on the document doesn t work in this browser you need to start the playback from the user-event itself
one way this can be done using a tidyverse solution is created on 2019-04-05 by the reprex package v0.2.1 please note that plyr should be loaded before dplyr
the common way to handle this is by making use of the fact that if whatever object you pass to myfun doesn t have the required functionality a corresponding exception will be raised usually typeerror or attributeerror
i m not so familiair with maven but added the following dependencies to my pom.xml i expected that the olwapi-contract dependency contained the test package
one is issue the variable i should be declared in the for-loop should be changed to the other change to make is the b function should be called outside loops
swift enums can now be exported to objective-c using the objective-c attribute
so the updated good would look something like below ps i am not familiar with rx-kotlin and hence my coding style will be more aligned towards rx-java style

the tour is complex and i can t post all the code to you i tried to put the main nodes in it
i assume it s 2d instead of 3d this what i do create a canvas object set the canvas scaler to scale with screen size set the reference resolution to for example 480x320 set the screen match mode to match with or height set the match to 1 if your current screen width is smaller 0 if height is smaller create an image as background inside the canvas add aspect ratio fitter script set the aspect mode to fit in parent so the ui anchor can be anywhere set the aspect ratio to 480 320 1.5 and add this snippet on main canvas awake method for 3d objects you can use any of the answers above
i prefer the new keyword for cases where an inherited interface has stronger restrictions on a method or properties when i get some explicit itrucker object i get its truck directly through the vehicle properties and do not need another cast which is in some cases quite handy
dart sdk can be found at flutter bin cache dart-sdk
this is what you should do instead now if i send a post request with postman but using the form-data type instead with a field with key task and a string value representing the name of the task to be created i get a a successful response
also children can have more than one parent ex
having said that if you want to use for-loop here is your corrected version as you can see the result is the same but in comparison it is more imperative rather than declarative it is more verbose and larger therefore more error-prone your problem was that you were updating the arrays as well iterating it causing the iteration to broke
and only keeping the rotate transform. so i m using flex i think grid will do too if the parent of the element would be smaller than the children i would use margin to position my child to center
the options are covered fairly well in chapter 4 of the ni compactrio developers guide but in summary tcp ip for messages commands or streaming data where no data can be lost udp for broadcasting updates where low latency is more important than 100 integrity web services for accessing current values tags - i would say these are also appropriate for short messages or commands
using getelementsbyid allows me to pass by this but objelement then doesn t support .click html button code the end result is to allow the csv to open as a new excel workbook sheet as from there i m very familiar with sorting filtering data
the tests that failed when ran by the automation server pass when ran manually - using test.only tried mostly headless with firefox and google-chrome but the same randomness happens with full ui as well
vbscript is not interchangeable with vba
we can fill the grouping column to replace the na elements with the preceding non-na elements filtering out the na rows based on the grouping values that are still na grouping by grouping slice the rows until the stop value in the type column assuming one start stop combination per grouping

using your own server for authentication if you dismiss my advise to use the google-servers for authentication then the scope of the tagged issues is getting larger as server-configuration apache nginx ... and server-side programming-languages php python ... might be involved
c must be defined as int to accommodate for all values returned by getchar 256 values of type unsigned chars and the special value eof
kindly check out lda mallet - it s more accurate than other lda implementations distributed lda - makes lda faster using parallel programming
i don t know swift but simply do something like this pseudo-code as i indicated if the bytes coming out of the device are big-endian you obviously do you can perhaps speed this up a bit by multiplying by the reverse because multiplication is usually a little faster than division
i understand it can be done client-side or server-side
also not sure which of mysql 5.7 and postgresql v11 is better for this kind of use case - this question arises as this use-case is primary and we can choose between either of the databases
i m trying to make the containers of the text and images match perfectly with width and height
each int type that is greater than chars takes into consideration the concept of little and big endian
ascending means that the range percentage is higher as the variable increases above the minimum and descending means that the range percentage value increases as the variable decreases below the maximum value
for instance in a streaming application saving data in hdfs or hbase will be much faster than in hive
i want to show all errors messages which i apply on aurelia validation .for example if user click on password input box then all related error message should be highlight show and hide remove errors step by step as user meet the required condition .i show you my model
but if my max value is bigger than 100 my min padding become greater than 1 and my chart is showing wrong data
essentially you will and up with multiplying m with a number between 0 up to but not including 1 and finally we are taking the floor of the result of that to get an integer. this is slower than division method but it doesn t matter what you choose for m value of m is not critical
you could use a switch inside a for-loop to handle the different id values this will not generate an error when arrays is shorter
you can set a jdbc connection property ssl to on or off as seen here that s what determines if the connection will be made via https or http going by the implementation here i tried it and it worked for me
from utf-8 url encoded chars 23 is # and from hexadecimal number system abcd is 43981 so it can be cast to int
this can also be applied to any implementations where long double has more than 63 bits of significand like powerpc or sparc there s a related question about calculating int arithmetic add 1 to uint_max and divide by n without overflow with also clever solutions
this option is also able to be used with firefox and google-chrome
note that checking an rsa signature is faster that checking a dsa or ecdsa one for respective keys length corresponding to the same security level
any action with the cells could be peroformed via getter setter
if it is possible swift would be better than objective-c

short answer keras is more high level than tensorflow in the sense that you can write code quicker with keras but it s less flexible
boolean false should be converted to int 0 but instead is converted to an empty string
so i have to write two views view 1 view 2 create or replace view comment_max_id_view as select max pkid from comments group by session_id here the problem is if i use this view to select for a particular period then the comment_max_id_view is doing a full table scan instead of just the selected date range which takes more than 5 minutes to get the result
maybe dask is more efficient than pandas however i have never used dask before

true vectorization i can t see but no explicit for loops is doable but i m not sure this will be any faster than a for-loop
duplicates can be reduced by grouping them in the selector in the type parameter i m guessing the reason why the selector grid is empty is that you are filtering against a null value
ionic 3 install the cordova and ionic native plugins you must append version 4 to the package name after the character version 5.x is not compatible with ionic 3 then add to provider source ionic 4 for angular the import path should end with ngx then add to provider source

the name and signature of function maxmin_rand suggest it is intended to return a number between max and min but it looks like it can return a number as large as max + min
the problem is when the data is queried from postgresql and then converted into json the big integer values are converted into text and will be recognized as text type in elastic search which can t be used for filtering and sorting
the base handler class has an empty flush method but streamhandler does not want to inherited that because it has a weird docstring this version does nothing and is intended to be implemented by subclassing

this is not the problem when i cv2.imshow it shows the image correctly with width larger than height like a normal horizontal rectangle i added mousecallback to get the pixel position so when i put my mouse nearer to the right edge of image i get error indexerror index 560 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 408 although i have clicked on the image
in order to achieve this you need to have the outside from the here s a solution this will align the to the start and the bottom of the . this require the image to have transparent background and the to have fixed width height or contain other views which will determine the dimensions
thought the example in swift jsonencoder can be accessed from objective-c
an example which shows this using some random data i generated it before you added the data is this will produce the easiest way to fix this though it does not fix the underlying data and won t work in all cases is simply to set the limits manually to account for the offset - which will give you if you want to include the months lower than the minimum 0 1 2 you can set the xticks and xticklabels manually - ax.set_xticks range -3 9 ax.set_xticklabels range 0 12 which will give you

chars pointers aren t somehow magically different than int pointers
json can take a while to serialize especially if you are using the r or python api because it is a separate process and needs to go back and forth between the native jvm executors on the worker nodes to serialize deserialize objects if you performed any wide transformations like aggregation or join prior to df.collect you most likely triggered a shuffle which will result in 200 default partitions being written to disk hence when you call collect it has to retrieve that data from disk which is slower than retrieving from ram although your data set is small you may need to increase the default executor ram executor cores slots # of executors and re-config the # of partitions to get more parallelism check number of partitions df.rdd.getnumpartitions check shuffle partitions spark.conf.get spark.sql.shuffle.partitions check other configs like executor ram cores and instances spark.sparkcontext.getconf .getall spark is a tough beast to tackle .
if a for-loop statement has to be expressed as a while loops statement then the init-statement has to be done before loops the condition expression can be reused for the condition in the while loops and the iteration expression has to be done last in the while loops

your best bet is to change folder structure to have multiple .css files for each theme and then load it using dynamic path as suggested in documentation language example or you could do something like this this way you d have cleaner code showing all possible themes that can be passed to prop static analysis would know exactly what the query string is so it will work and then you d use it like so i d rather have the query string implementation as you ve suggested but for now as far as i ve investigated it s not possible
to correct this modify the q statement but your code has other problem you don t test for functions return you use feof which is counter productive testing the fgets return is enough you use dynamic memory where static is enough line countryname

you can check if it is inside the words the important line is this we have 3 rules for it to count the puntuation p is in the words 2 the words w does not start by the punctuation p the words w does not ends by the punctuation p a more pythonic way of doing such would be to use the str available methods endswith and startswith ... if p in w and not w.startswith p and not w.endswith p ...
other than the added complexity page segmentation has one other problem to work around unlike the one huge array sieve where start indexes are calculated easily once and then used for the entire array segmented sieves require either that the start addresses be calculated by modulo division operations per prime per page computationally expensive or additional memory needs to be used to store the index reached per base prime per page so the start index doesn t have to be recalculated but this last technique precludes multi-threading as these arrays get out of sync

you should read about what operator precedence in php is for example in the expression 1 + 5 3 the answer is 16 and not 18 because the multiplication operator has a higher precedence than the addition + operator
multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction and all have left-to-right associativity

although this isn t the heap sort algorithm sorts a data set by using heap building a heap does require some comparison work to ensure it remains a heap you re wanting a max heap so all children are less than their parent
it is important to note that for a min heap the minimum element is the root so instead of having all parent bigger than their children it becomes all children bigger than their parent
you still have one list. the following statement just causes _btctx to point to the same list instance as btctx so actually the main list was modified in the remove and or add . one way to remove add the items is to perform a regular for-loop with an index from last to first and then you will be able to remove add items with no problem. another way would be to keep the foreach loops but store the indices to be removed and the items to be added inside loops and then perform the actual adding removal after loops removing should be done from the last index to the first

just ensure that you set aspect mode in aspect ratio fitter of raw image to width controls height or height controls width whichever is larger based on orientation code snippet let me know if you face any issue
udp would not be faster than tcp in your case if you would ensure that the data is intact and in order in your code

first of all please make sure that the dependency that you ve added indeed accessible by maven even without ide just run something like mvn package to see that maven downloads the dependency now if the project was imported into idea by opening the pom.xml intellij is supposed to build its internal data based on the information that was found in pom.xml so the following might help maven - reimport all maven projects - this will trigger the synchronization process settings - build execution deployment - build tools - maven maven home directory - intellij might be configured with a different maven than you think you use has something bundled with ide
there is no reason at all to use goto in your console application. the first goto parsefile is just a break in a switch case a switch case would be much more readable since you can get multiple break condition and know they are all in the same if clause the goto start is just a simple while in the beginning of your application again a while would be much more readable since you will be able to tell in one second what block of code will repeat itself also you will be able to know why it should be repeated with goto you will not be able to tell why repeat that code block until you read every line of it and know when you will not reach that goto
on my part i believe that something that uses parts of this code is the way to go but it still lacks the catch any called attribute part so running those lines with the previous code sample will print here is stuff getting done instead of action_to_override method action_a not in my_object class. action_a method action_b not in my_object class. action_b some similar methods will have to be made for getter and setter however the idea stays the same

you should create a class containing your data to be passed and extends implements that from serializable or parcelable and then you can put an object of that class as an extra to your intent and use it in your service . in this class you creat your data pass them and then retrieve them. for creating your custom parcelable class you can see these following links 1.stackoverflow 2.medium and according to this link it s better to use parcelable
this part is the most recent piece of code i tried what i wish to achieve 3 checkbox only one can be checked radio button type but user should also be able to uncheck that s the reason i am not using radio button when i click on checkbox a div a should show when i click on checkbox b checkbox a becomes unchecked and div a goes back to display none but div b shows and so on the value of the checkbox are also the ids of the divs
in the case of integer arguments this means integer promotions which means that all integer types smaller than int are converted to int or unsigned int
the standard section 7.21.6.1.7 explains it this way the argument will have been promoted according to the integer promotions but its value shall be converted to short int or unsigned short int before printing
after a few days of struggling i managed to do this caching later using intermediate contrainer and i d like to summarize my findings here as this topic is so useful and being frequently shown in google search frontpage kim s answer is only working to a certain condition pom.xml cannot be changed plus maven do a regular update daily basis by default mvn dependency go-offline -b --fail-never has a similar drawback so if you need to pull fresh code from repo high chances are maven will trigger a full checkout every time mount volume is not working as well because we need to resolve the dependencies during image being built finally i have a workable solution combined may be not working to others build an image to resolve all the dependencies first not intermediate image create another dockerfile with intermediate image sample dockerfiles like this #docker build -t dependencies . from ubuntu copy pom.xml pom.xml run mvn dependency go-offline -b --fail-never from dependencies as intermediate from tomcat run git pull repo.git whatsoever run mvn package the idea is to keep all the dependencies in a different image that maven can use immediately it could be other scenarios i haven t encountered yet but this solution relief me a bit from download 3gb rubbish every time i cannot imagine why java became such a fat whale in today s lean world
i want to add full screen overlay image on different size of video i used ffmpeg it work fine if overlay and video has same scale ratio same width and height . overlay image squeezed if video height and width size is smaller than overlay image but i want to apply like snap chat video they add black view on top and bottom ffmpeg command is i want following output link is mention below

you could simplify your code with required html5 attribute which prevents the form send with default browser notice if the value of input is empty. the submit button call the form onsubmit event which can be stopped by preventdefault method and then redirected by location.href just like you did
i have used i m now using opera since it s more lighter than google-chrome
the item height is automatically decided by its children height also the first children of the item deeporange container below height is dependent to parent item height is t the item of listview its height must be fill to parent item
while asking the question i wondered if checking the height and width of both parent and child would work out and decrease the fontsize until the height and width of the child is not bigger than the height and width of the parent and it seems like it actually did work out
i figured it out by simply adding a static_ip eth0 to dhcpcd.conf file and then a dhcp-range for interface eth0 in the dnsmasq.conf file and finally adding the following two lines in the iptables.ipv4.nat file -a forward -i ppp0 -o eth0 -m state --state related established -j accept -a forward -i eth0 -o ppp0 -j accept i was now able to have internet through ethernet as well raspberry pi s wireless chip
since the amazon linux is more akin to open-source centos than redhat you can attempt to follow the yum instructions provided for centos oracle linux
1.5.3 otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
while it s common and trivial to move container images between machines viz docker push and docker pull it s less easy to move containers between machines
it can be http without ssl or https with ssl
let s suppose the nowadays usual implementation ieee-754 arithmetic int is 32-bit double is 64-bit binary float with these both are always true because int can be converted to double without any precision loss
suppose if iam having below array with min max in the list of elemnet in the below array it should divide into 10 chunks it should divide 10 chunks if we take first element of the array 10 20 so array should be divided into bucket list like this array 10-11 11-12 12-13 .... 19-20 next time this bucket should be updated consider next element say 5 30 where min 5 is less than 10 and max 30 is greater 20.bucket should be update into 10 equal parts again and this needs to repeated.bucket remains same if above condition not satisfies
it s proxy issue these are the workarounds method 1 npm config set proxy npm config set https-proxy notes for ssl https proxies the protocol in url should be http not https if your set up is on a docker vagrant instance or a hosted vm use ip address instead of hostname for proxy as the later might not be resolvable

if you are using more than 1 swiper in a single page then you can replace with the index of your swiper or you can use framework7 api to update your swiper
can you give me some hints what have to be done to get working example how to tie together component + renderer in faces-config.xml which annotations need to be used in component class how to bind custom tag definition to my class component where to put component tag definition so jsf can recognize it .
number of parameter for convolution layer can be calculated as width x height x c in + bias x c out for first layer parameter will be 3 x 3 x 3 + 1 x 10 which is 280 now for second layer 3 x 3 x 10 + 1 x 20 here c_in 10 is from previous layer so this layer have 1820 parameter and total parameter is 1820 + 280 which is 2100
then instead of an explicit loops lapply is used which should be faster than a for-loop
to get the effect that you want first the width of the div needs to be bigger than height in order to see the repeat image in x-axis for example css here s the example
i created a rest api project and i m tring to access the https endpoint using curl like this i googled around and these are the steps i took to extract the certificate from dotnet and add it to my repository of trusted ca certificates this is what i tried to do to add the certificate i also tried setting the curl_ca_bundle env var like this i keep getting the same curl error more over firefox and google-chrome tells me the connection is not secure additional info references
the warning is not issued if signed integer is of larger size than the unsigned integer in this case the unsigned integer is converted to larger signed integer and fits into positive range of the larger type
this is probably not possible as bokeh widgets and ipywidgets do not generally work together or integrate at all
note even though it was deemed so by another user this question is not a duplicate of php pdo get the columns name of a table as that post is more about the general code rather than my specific issue

i have an arraylist executed like this im trying to pass in a subclassing object with more parameters than the superclass
for instance if is equal to math and is equal to 1 i d like the file to have the following input 1math 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 if another class is added with a title of science then the file should now read 1math 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 02science 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 what appears to happen is that although the code will catch the chars array part of the struct math science in the example it will have trouble with the int and instead print out junk in its place and the junk is often times longer than 1 chars 1 int long
daily at midnight or once an hour or every 5 minutes - if your server can stem it add some means to figure out if a score has changed timestamp everything that changes the score store the timestamp of the score ... this solution is somewhat performant the update that probably will be done via cron jobs and it always produces correct and recent results
html code with such html code i d like to have fixed height on main element for example 80vh fixed height for all the elements first and third 40vh + second 80vh fixed width for first and third element 50vw fluid width for second element - but this is main problem - second element has to be in the same place and grow horizontally to create scroll on the bottom of the site please find my codepen i ve added button that ll add pixels to second element - but it destroys my website
and as powermockito is said to be not compatible with junit 5 yet till now and i don t want to add another dependency just for testing so i will test with reflection
update in the case you need to use several curves you can do it like this i m putting all the functionality for drawing the wave in a function drawwave that takes the amplitude and the trigonometric function to be used sin or cos as arguments
i think the last term in the formula can be calculated like this later on you are going to need to use a for-loop or even better arrays but a for-loop is easier to save the position of the oscillator at each time point
both of them require a bit of work as fgets also stores the line-break which has to be disposed otherwise strstr would look for something like words n presumably in vain while memmove moves memory so the size has to be told explicitly and it has to include the null terminator the space-trick is still applied in the test i ve put _dunyali into the second line of input just with a space - here the formatter apparently ate that space that is why it is marked with an underscore now but in real-life you would have to take care about spaces one of which can usually removed and punctuation which may or may not be needed afterwards surrounding the words

it is quite enough to have only selenium-java it will resolve via maven transitive dependency mechanism given you mention that you have to manually download selenium standalone server you don t need this selenium-server dependency as well so it should be as simple as pom.xml test class demo more information remote webdriver selenium with java chromedriver - getting started
the 0-4 can be radio button which allows only one selection and the a-b-c-d-e can be checkbox that allow multiple selections
you can use aliases while grouping and you can use columns you don t display to sort. the only restriction is that when not being grouped by the columns to sort by need to be aggregated sum max min etc
so i just detected a problem on my fpdf when i m writing the description to the multicell i press enter to break line and this happens image with problem but my multicell code is programmed to calculate the string size and when the size is bigger than the width of the cell it ads one break line and the height size gets bigger but when i press enter it just add the same height example my name is joão - height 6.5 my name is joão line break i m using fpdf - height 6.5 + 6.5 instead of height 6.5 + 1 this is my pdf without pressing enter image this is my pdf with multicell on action image i will leave the code that it s calculating all the multicell stuff
post response i receive a token but when i try to do something as simple as get limits get the response is the strange thing is that when i change all my credentials to a free developer account created with a different email address everything works fine
i know it can be done by for-loop but i am not able to make list_name using a loops
according to 3 udp packets can be converted into rtp packets
this can be done using modulo remainder after division the next thing is to figure out the opposite where given an encrypted character you have to find the unencrypted character by subtract 10
you can use arrays instead of using variable so it will store all values which will be looped in for-loop
another case you will encounter this issue is that when you set up redirection from http to https automatically the post request will be redirected as get request if this redirection setup is at work
in the arrays the first element is always zero convention but i didn t zero the variables insinde the pixel loops when switching to the next pixel which gave me wrong times for a senseful computation since the number of iteration of the inner for-loop is greater then
hence with right logging practices get api is as secure as post api
this file needs to be printed in portrait orientation but by default it is in landscape - and i can t find any way to change orientation by script
also conda can has larger control over the environment and can for example have a different version of python installed inside of it virtualenv - only the python available in the system
using numpy with r_ cumsum and hsplit is about 60x faster than normal loops in case col_list has 3000 lists numpy for-loop validation

i made a class for the frames assuming they are stored as an int array can easily be modified for double or any other type you want stored
but in fact a search form should be submitted by get not post since it is not making changes in the backend and could conceivably be cached
as http only supports post and get such a change could be requested via post other media types might support other http methods such as put which according to its specification last paragraph page 27 is allowed to have side-effects or patch which needs to be applied atomically - either fully or not at all
post should work in all cases put is probably more intuitive to typical updates done in web forms while patching would require your client to actually calculate the steps needed to transform the current resource representation to the desired one if you use application json-patch+json in particular
printf is showing you a -1 since the format of d is a signed integer which is smaller than unsigned usually by 1 bit
inside that if statement is another for statement which is throwing me the error - int cannot be converted to boolean

setting the width to be fixed and height auto so that the image aspect ratio is maintained and visually rows look uniform
things i have tried using the index as key prop -- i don t think this is a good idea since i want the user to be able to rearrange the folder however they want which makes index unstable assigning each folder file with a uuid as it is read from the folder structure -- this also doesn t seem like the best idea since if i enter a different directory then return to the first directory the id s will be assigned each time
the info column has to be evaluated for min max width and word-wrapping and the heading column has to be evaluated for word-wrapping based on the info columns variable width.
a namedtuple gets to be way more memory-efficient than a dictionary because as far as memory layout goes it s just a tuple

another option if you re not happy with seaborn but don t want to go too deep in matplotlib api is to create the errorbars with seaborn then tweak them at your convenience as i said they are just matplotlib objects if you provide a more concrete example i might be able to help more
the points can be calculated by sin and cos distributed around a full circle two_pi draw the sides of the pyramid by triangular primitives see beginshape and draw the base of the pyramid by an closed shape see the following example which uses the function to draw pyramids with a different number of sides
i tried to use format nested json but not relevant with post http because my api must send api key for get response value
to have it more equivalent to the java version change your c++ main to note that by default c++ s console i o iostream cin cout is even slower than it could be because syncronization with c s console i o stdio scanf printf is enabled to let a program not do weird things if both cout and printf are used. here you can read about cout s performance when synchronization is turned off
still the tidyr dplyr solution looks better
i add second label called content2 if i set grow 0 content2 will not fill extra vertical space if i set grow 1 content2 will fill extra vertical space shrink property plays a role when the wrap property is set to nowrap and the aggregate width of a row of children is greater than the width of the flexlayout or the aggregate height of a single column of children is greater than the height of the flexlayout
i believe the process of building an image could be attempted with manjaro given the fact that it is originally intended for archlinux
by setting the element s onclick prop to this causes the onclick function defined in foo to be called each time the element is rendered
for the second case y will be promoted to int with value 0 then converted to double for the comparison

the problem does not seem to be related to cassandra or scylla. you do need access to docker hub to download the relevant image for the first time for example when running docker run hello-world once you solve that you can move to run cassandra or scylla with for example with docker run --name some-scylla -d scylladb scylla
my question is this udp is way faster than tcp and a delayed packet has no more value than a lost packet in most cases so udp seemed like the best choice
the normal way of doing this would be to use two nested loops - if you re iterating over a known number of items rather than unboundedly until some condition holds then for-loop is easier for x in 0
i m sorry to say this and maybe i m not solving your problem exactly but postgresql is 10 years older than mysql and is extremely advanced compared to mysql and there s many ways to achieve this easily

to stop the confusion on this page actually this is the best answer which is fast and works for both positive and negative values of x i ran speed tests of 10 million computations on php 7.2.15 and even though both solutions give the same results fmod is slower than floor ceil
optionally serializable names properties need to be reconciled with deserialization names here constructor parameters via jsonproperty attributes
except it is theoretically possible that int is wider than uint64_t in which case the arithmetic would be done with int but that is still satisfactory performing a cast guarantees the arithmetic will be done with at least that width. for real numbers the usual arithmetic conversions are largely if either operand is long double the other is converted to long double

exactly what ratio depends on how hash-collision will be handled - namely either alternative buckets will be found open addressing aka closed hashing with a good hash function 20-50 more buckets than key is a generally sane range each bucket contains some chain of elements that hashed there separate chaining with a good hash function it doesn t matter as much so you could have half as many buckets as key or twice as many and things will rock along without any great drama that said when the hash function isn t good and the key being hashed aren t random enough to help the hash function perform adequately it helps to have a tablecapacity that reduces collisions try any prime number around the value derived from the number-of-keys-being-hashed and the ratios listed above
there is a more updated fork of this plugin available at you could probably use ionic native for angular which gives a more angular like api otherwise you should be able to work with filechooser directly as this is the js object that is added to the global scope make sure to wait for the deviceready event before trying to access it
opening a tcp socket is more costly that opening a udp socket because opening and closing a tcp socket creates a tcp session whereas opening and closing a udp socket is a local action only

i m trying to prepare my custom keras model for deploy to be used with tensorflow serving but i m running into issues with preprocessing my images
for example here are a few equations without maths optimization all codes written in julia 1.1 not juliapro i optimized them with a few tricks including because addition is faster than multiplication
c has to be declared int not chars
step away from concrete numbers and for example check that a both elements width and height are positive integral numbers b check that the width is larger than the height which should be the case for a text like abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz c test that for the height is larger than the width
this error only occurs with me if i try using more than one tensorflow keras model in the same server

can we handle checked exception-handling inside the module using try-catch block
use intersection area minus non-common area as a metric of similarity shapely can be used for that non-common area is union - intersection or simply symmetric difference final metric intersection.area - symmetric_difference.area intersection area this approach might be better than processing distance in some situations for example you want to prefer fewer points covering whole area over huge amount of very close points that cover only half of the area it s more obvious way to compare candidates with different number of points but it has it s disadvantages too just draw some examples on paper and experiment to find them other ideas instead of using polygons or concave hull you can build a linear ring from your points and then use contour.buffer some_distance
it will check if today is less than max time and more than min time
some remarks for improvements do not use global variables use timeit for meaningful measurements use python 3 i think you can use permutations from itertools which is faster in generating but also produces less data make everything possible constant
tom karzes compare non-strings with memcmp unnecessary code is not need to detect the end use the fread return value
as for your existing architecture mvp it is better to put the logic in the presenter actually there should not be any logic on the view in your case custom view aside from taking input eg click of a button and providing output
however because c# does not have checked exception-handling the only way i can think of anticipating exception-handling s is to surround all sections of my top-calling code with try-catch es
if the following is added you get the following pyqt5.qtcore.qsize 38 22 pyqt5.qtcore.qsize 20 20 where we see that the qscrollarea has a greater width in the sizehint than the qframe and that explains why the observed behavior
i could set hardcoded height and width values but that also seems like a bad idea
i m new to appium but quite experienced with selenium
a while loops is easier to use for a one-by-one operation than a for-loop
the problem i am trying to create a singleton which stores information that can only be accessed with setter and getter
i have a high-end debian desktop with a amd 2970wx 64gb ram 1tbyte ssd system disk multi-terabyte 7200rpm sata data disk and just running wc on a 25gbyte file some archive sitting on a hard disk takes more than 10 minutes measured with time and wc is doing some really simple textual processing by reading that file sequentially so should run faster than grep but to my surprise does not
most major database jdbc drivers already have a statement cache that can be configured including postgresql oracle derby mysql db2 and many others
but i don t find any answers related to that or any equivalent variables that can be used in postgresql instead of wait_timeout variable in mysql
question what is where can i find the criteria for determining whether a request should be made as get or post
according to your requirement a particular time interval can be set so that the recalculation can be triggered using cron jobs service which invokes the recalculation service within the interval
but main problem arises when i started to make build for that.what i saw is that value which is not in string produces error while writing or reading data from async storage. it gives me error in ios build something like. nsnull cannot be converted into nsstring so i changed my code to something like this now this works fine in ios build.so my doubt is that how can i parse a json or is there any standart way to parse json in react native so that i did not face problem which is faced while making ios build for react native
generally for your example exposing class s variables should be done via public internal protected properties via get
in addition any children associated with that parent should be removed parent owns the children
if your site loads with http but not with https that means your website is not reachable with ssl so check that ssl is enabled
a large value of η gives a higher probability for creating near parent solutions and a small value of η allows distant solutions to be selected as children solutions
it is more about the readability and maintainability of your code in the answer i already put a link to a post where is better explained you are creating technical debt in your code you are initializing arrays and filling them handling indices and more.
it will be quicker than pandas method. dask write function will break your file into mulitple chuncks and store it
once you are in a data frame context the underlying order doesn t matter since you are addressing rows by name anyway in that particular case where the row name is different you ll get col7 null for those rows and col7_id filled which can be fixed in post via sql in case for some reason reading in the whole directory doesn t work just iterate over all the files create a df in the loop and use the df.union -function then you even can handle the col7_id there
this can usually be disabled in google-chrome opera in firefox it s in console s settings press f1 while using console another option is to write more data along with the value eg.
that said it seems like this is not working properly in chrome 76.0 after a simple test with a min value greater than the max all times fail the validation and the form just don t work
in s is a wrong format because you write a chars not a string out of that the natural type for an index is size_t not int use size_t for both i and len and in that case change the loop to use index without supposing it can be negative if the input string has more than 19 chars scanf will write out of word with an undefined behavior limit the size using the format 19s 19 rather than 20 to have the place for the ending null chars word is an array do not use a to give its address in scanf check the result of scanf if you want to detect eof flush the output writing a newline after the loop so a possible way is
turns out that i m an idiot and was running mstest when i should have been running nunit console since our tests are all using nunit
also you will likely get a warning with the current code non-interactive elements should not be assigned mouse or keyboard event listeners you should place an interactive element anchor button etc. within the list item
i am confused how a int number be assigned to chars variable without explicit casting since int is of 4 bytes and without explicitly casting it to chars using cast operator
in where a and b are unsigned short if unsigned short is narrower than int a and b are each converted to int per the integer promotions c 2018 6.3.1.1 2 and because unsigned short being narrower than int necessarily means int can represent all values of unsigned short
the expression a b likely has type int but will have type unsigned int in the event that there are any values that can be represented as unsigned short s but not as int s
that s ok i can made it boolean i get a new error operator cannot be applied to java.lang.integer boolean so i changed the returned value to int i got the same operator cannot be applied to int boolean seems like i am not going on the correct way.
it can be made better by making super as a callable that only take args as argument by encapsulating the self next super method
i m trying to centralize the placeholder caret in the center vertically and horizontally in firefox and google-chrome but it does not get aligned in firefox correctly
therefore using the same number of bits fixed-point has more resolution than floating-point
even with other choices of how many bits to use for which parts floating-point needs to use some bits for the exponent and fixed-point uses zero so fixed-point always has finer resolution than floating-point
note that the fixed scale means fixed-point will sometimes be less accurate than floating-point
if you go to branch in devops select your branch - policies you can allow only squash merge this should make all pull requests into the branch bound by the policy to be done using squash merge
if you are looking for a structure that will be sorted a treeset might be better or maybe a plain old arraylist that you explicitly sort after you insert all the elements
please note that if you do not mark an action method as post by default it will be considered get
i need the user to be able to select using mouse or keyboard a selected tag value and be able to copy the text somehow
this can be done with apache or nginx or even iis or with a built-in server but recommend xampp
a careful rewrite of metrics can be used in prometheus to sanitize it
as a matter of good habit it s also better to check the return value of the malloc also strtol is better than atoi as the former provides error checking
swift structs can t be used in objective-c
cookies are primarily for server-side reading can also be read on client-side localstorage and sessionstorage can only be read on client-side
memory allocated by malloc can be reallocated with realloc
alloca is worse than malloc because it causes unpredictable stack usage and can lead to a stack overflow which won t be detected at all or which will only be detected by a program crash
i can imagine this can be done using vlookup and countif but not having much luck asking google
my guess is either your post data or your response object is not considered valid json and that is why firefox throws an error maybe google-chrome is more forgiving
indirect some processors may have a limited range for the immediate value for example 8-bits and anything larger such as int or double would require indirect access an addition word for the pointer address
with matplotlib i can plot a 3d surface with projected contours of the surface plot for each axis and i was wondering if the same could be done with mayavi
if so you may want to consider separating this pom into a separate aggregator module definitions and parent anything else in the current pom that should be shared with children
you need to include to have std cin and std cout
this explanation is when width is bigger than height the first i do is calculate the scale using width or height depend which is the bigger
in the older versions of nop commerce i have seen that they always use to return but now in the latest versions most of the view models are returned in ilist.i know with ilist its good to work with abstraction instead of concrete type list but then ienumerable is much better because everything derives from it
the solution to the scope problem is to do the following create a minimal temp table say with one column use alter table on the temp table within your routine to make its schema match your needs this can be tricky but it can be done put data into the temp table return from your routine - the calling routine will now be able to access the temp table if this is of interest i can make a longer post with a stored procedure to do the above
i have a parent class that has a setter that returns queryfiltre value and a getter that is supposed to pass the queryfiltre value to my child class
imagemagick might be another good choice to try because it probably has better coverage than pillow does
socket ip + port there are three types of sockets stream tcp order and delivery guaranteed no duplication no length or char boundaries for data connection-oriented reliable concurrency datagram udp packet-based connectionless datagram size limit data can be lost or duplicated order not guaranteed not reliable raw direct access to lower layer protocols ip icmp i do not see any strict rule for transport protocol type as to what socket has to use what transport protocol and reliability should not be mistaken because udp is realiable in case both ends are active
you can fix this by declaring the properties outside of this function like so this way your custom properties is held on within the browser and can be changed and inherited by the dom when set
compression ratio gzip compression uses more cpu resources than snappy or lzo but provides a higher compression ratio
snappy often performs better than lzo
switching between get and post requires more than just changing the verb in the request

i want to configure an apache redirect rule for one of the post endpoints say a.com b now i want to redirect this request to some external domain preserving post method post shouldn t be converted to get after redirect example a.com b -- z.com b
even though the book is for common lisp much of it can be used in scheme as well
i have actually tried something similar but pandas is much much slower taking around 1s while dplyr takes 200ms just one example i was able to make it faster by filtering the dataset before grouping and aggregating but this takes away the freedom of doing multiple filtering and comparing them in a single line of code
more specifically the best-case runtime for boyer-moore is o m n which is much faster than what rabin-karp or kmp can provide
if its not possible with beautifulsoup then what is the next best library for xml document edit and creation would be lxml
it is used as an international standard and can be found more or less everywhere with octal i m not sure with decimal you can as it is represented by mantissa and exponent as shown below 15000 is also equal to 1.5e4 that is known as scientific notation and lastly in hexadecimal there is no shortened way hope this helps
i don t have any experience with nginx because i always used apache and htaccess so any help is appreciated i got a weird problem when i browse one folder markuz i get a 404 error but it doesn t seem to be generated from nginx if i try other non-configured folders i get a 404 with nginx written on footer but not on this specific folder... also i got a second problem with pretty permalinks like for example wordpressfolder product name that gets rewritten to wordpressfolder name and such
on most systems chars and unsigned chars are smaller than int so they promote to int when passed as variadic arguments
on exotic systems which your target is not where unsigned chars is as large as int it will be promoted to unsigned int instead in which case 4 would have ub since it requires an int
i have an image which has height greater than its width
here are corrected versions first question second question note how c must be defined as chars for the fscanf version and int for the fgetc approach
for anyone else facing this issue after upgrading to ubuntu 19.04 try running sudo apt --auto-remove purge npm sudo apt --auto-remove purge nodejs it seems there must be more than one versioning of nodejs or npm installed on upgrade
from spring documentation ... you should use the prototype scope for all beans that are stateful while the singleton scope should be used for stateless beans
in my case it was because i was using get when i should have used post
it was designed to be used in jboss or wildfly but there shouldn t be anything precluding its use in tomee
there is a couple of things that needs to be changed in your js code when parsing int based on 10 chars the resulting number is to large to be parsed as int
but if the window is too short in height and too long in width then images from lower rows will move to upper rows
i m using the mdui button style it appears to be fixed width and height
this problem occur when we paste image from explorer to drawable folder then it ask whether to copy drawable or drawable-v24 and if you have pasted images in both directory structures or have one more images with different directory structure then it will show this error make sure to delete the icon from drawable-v24 after moving it to drawable folder and clean the project and then run it will work
rearrange the page you could check if width is greater than height to determine if the device is now in landscape or portrait this is the recommended implementation pulled right from the xamarin.forms documentation
is it like a directory is a folder that has one or more folder in it or its just same as folder
x i want to call this logic from swift but also make use of generics for t conforming to nsobject this works fine however if i were to call the generic method with a value-semantic type it fails even if the type can be bridged to objective-c compile error a.typedproducesomething of string.self if i call it with the bridged type then the return value is an optional so i can t convert it back is there any way to get typedproducesomething to work with value types bridged to objective-c
you can solve it using divide and conquer approach find a random element in between the minimum and maximum check if it s median if the median is lower or higher than it and reduce the problem to a smaller size only on a subrange of the array
on the other hand contrary to what i thought background-image are supported as well as background-position so you probably could use it to make your watermark
note the intent is that an inline-functions that is the subject of an explicit instantiation declaration will still be implicitly instantiated when odr-used basic.def.odr so that the body can be considered for inlining but that no out-of-line copy of the inline-functions would be generated in the translation unit
if you set overflow hidden on the parent children that are wider or taller than the parent will clip at the edges of the parent though their width will remain the same
you can set max-width 100 on children to keep them from growing wider than the parent s width
for example i ran the following to try to make a chart with a 16 9 width-to-height ratio the height is longer than the width so something weird is happening
what i have tried the same thing can be done using mysql using stuff for xml path but it seems to be difficult in postgresql sql as it doesn t support these things in postgresql sql i tried string_agg but it says me to group by everything 2nd thing i was trying was using with clause first create the concatenated strings of table 2 group by on fp_inst_id but in postgresql sql it allows group by on primary key which is normal select or it asks to use the aggregate function i m trying to do this in postgresql sql through a query
you could use media orientation ... mediaqueries to detect wheter youre on landscape which means the viewports width is greater then the height or on portrait which means the viewports width is equal or less then the height
since std mt19937 is superior to rand the answer should be modulo is faster than division
a bit off-topic but worth mentioning that if you d like to say that function template fun is noexcept only if t 1 doesn t throw then should be the first noexcept is a specifier the second one is an operator
get is faster than post

to keep the gui thread going i moved qnetworkaccessmanager into a completely different thread with qthread thinking this would solve the issue however the gui thread still freezes
reference 1.5.3 otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand the operand with signed integer type shall be converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type
jsonpath it is pretty straightforward to be achieved with jsonpath jackson it also could be achieved with jackson gson in case you prefer gson jsonpath with jackson or gson depending on your needs you could combine jsonpath with jackson or gson
if we re just going to cast to the expected type we could use . a dictionary of getter with the property name as the key would look like this to store the getter for a property propertyinfo discovered by reflection storing setter is more complicated
sample code below is an excerpt of my dataframe here is the list i created that includes all of the licenses with the acceptable programs underneath each what i ideally would like as a final column would be whether the license and program are a match or not i am thinking i need the mutate function and maybe using the purrr map function but i am not super familiar with tidyverse and would really appreciate help
if a row matches the regex but has more than expected grouping the additional grouping are just ignored the solution is to use intermediate table + filtering rows when selecting from it
this can be very helpful and logical with uitableview but layout calculation in case of uicollectionview is better to be determined by simpler calculative approach
the filtering should be done before grouping
in google-chrome the native checkbox is darker than opera s and edges one
iii the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined
this is how you can implement it so try also changing the form s method to post when you use the form model helper because html forms can only be sent by get or post methods hence why one has to spoof the other crud methods
e userprofile desktop folder would not work because in this case the argument string would be interpreted as folder with an invalid relative path to root directory of current drive instead of option e with folder to open
what is the difference between case1 case2 case2 results in a crash. strdup is as good as malloc followed by strcpy
maybe clr has already upgrade to angular 8 and you will have to do as well or you will need to grab an older versioning of clr that is still compatible with versioning 6 you re using
subtyping section where the the supertype relation is specified as the reflexive and transitive closure of the direct supertype relation 1 and the latter includes for primitive types double 1 float long 1 int so the method test int float is more specific than test long double because int is a subtype of long and float is a subtype of double
if you want to give fixed width and height to your widgets wrap it with sizedbox. you can specify fixed width and height and you child widget will be the exact dimension
a linked view property that reads a bindableobject supplied by an ancestor so the environment prop can be supplied to children from the ancestor not necessarily it should come from its immediate parent
my guess the problem is there with the tf.concat function which should be put as tensorflow keras layer of lambda but i tried that too and of no help
it is shorter than a for-loop and maybe also more effective for big arrays to use a built in sentinel
i have a view and i add a subview to this with the following autolayout requirements if view width is greater than or equal to view height then i want subview width to be 75 of view width and height to be 15 points if view width is less than view height then i want subview width to be fixed 15 points and subview height to be equal to 75 of view height

the layout from this command is predictable and works independent of regional settings user settings or system language so the command will always return in bat file in command line this commands result 20190609 may i can also suggest wmic path win32_localtime get day month year in looping for result day month year 9 6 2019 a b c the difference is no zero in number for month day less equals 9 so you can use this bat to put leading zero in this case result in yearmonthday 20190609 obs. in powershell the layout can be customized simple by tostring yyyymmdd the strings can be set with tostring
i would highly recommend using pyenv to manage multiple verions of python and it makes switching between them really easy both locally and globally and use it in combination with a virtualenv per project you are working on
but the problem is - i dont want them to be so huge i want them to have fixed height and width max 100x100px
you can also check cytoscape software - maybe it can fit you a bit more than gephi
in other words children can t have higher opacity than parent
when max-width is smaller than width of .divs is effectively smaller than thus margin 0 auto works
jquery doesn t detect changes on val so that function is the way to go but it s being called out of scope and the event would be better with mouseup like this this will set the value one character delayed for it to work correctly i would suggest reading the virtualkeyboard doc to change it s event from click to mousedown
you can do that by using charindex replace len and substr functions as or returns

i m assuming here that action.change is a string value set to either subscribe or unsubscribe and that string can be used to map to indexes with an extra dictionary now you have two dictionary with unsubscribes and subscribes which can be processed separately if you are using python 3.6 or newer dictionary produce their keys and values in insertion order so the above will process all unsubscribes in the same relative order they were listed in the actions_list and the same applies to subscribes
viewdidload will always be called much sooner than viewdidappear
you will probably already have needed to upgrade your protocol versioning from 2.x to 3.0 and if you have then sagepay should take care of the 3ds process for you and hopefully will upgrade that process to 3ds2 when they see fit
if your picture is higher than wider it will have letterboxes at the left and right sides. let s say a2 is bigger meaning that your picture s height is bigger than its width

using a foreach loops is somewhat easier than using a for-loop as it eliminates the need for an index variable and an indexed arrays access
i ve tired to configure an nginx server with ssl but the site is not open but with https it s open normally
it is usually more efficient than strcpy which must scan the data it copies or memmove which must take precautions to handle overlapping inputs
anytime an int value with a type smaller than int chars short is used in a context where an int can be used the value is promoted to an int
a nested interface can be declared as public private or protected
you likely have some versioning of requests installed that is at least 2.10.0 but you can check with the following if your installed versioning is less than 2.10.0 upgrade with proxy configuration according to the linked answer we set up a dict of our proxy using https in place of http because all of praw s requests happen over https we then have to pass this to the session that praw uses
here is such a rational class it could be easily extended to do more than multiplication addition division negation inversion ... notice how the last function can concentrate on the recipe logic delegating the use of fractions to the rational class which in turn is completely ignorant of the recipe-business
listen keyup better timing than with keydown on the parent only it ll bubble up from the child elements
in order to do that columns that are supposed to be distinct will be left alone such as id in the following example while the rest should be aggregated using min max or any other you find appropriate

thus if the execution environment represents short as something smaller than int unsigned short becomes int
due to templates specialization might not even contain a chars that can be cast to int
hi i am totally beginner on ci i am trying to work with a ci script to learn on it.codes are quit big cant share here and i am not so sure exactly which part do you need that s why i posted it into 3rd party site and linked bellow here is my codes for a form and here is controller and bellow is a screenshot of the form on the form when i put information correctly and click submit button this not giving any error but information s are not saved and fetch old data.i checked from and i found post request is 403 error.bellow is screenshot of inspection element i already changed upload folder and sub folders permission 0777 but this doesn t work
i am trying to list down all the files and its parameters within folder recursively to list all the files in the directory sub directory that has size greater than 10000 bytes and not modified more than 30 days
it works for most of it the problem starts when the height is alot larger than the width 3x9 3x11 5x11 etc. as you can see the first line is out of place increasing the height further will repeat this pattern
and since you are converting a single chars to an int character.getnumericvalue makes more sense then parseint
that way a project could still depend on their own versioning of the codestyle -- but the upgrade path is much more straight forward and should only contain of upgrade the dependency
a string delimited by double-quotes does not need enclosed single-quotes to be escaped and vice versa
in my experience implementations do a better job with sin and cos than with tan and this also applies to the inverses. neither the c standard nor the ieee754 floating point specifications a common scheme adopted by floating point in c require these functions to be as precise as the data types they use cf
how can i set handsontable width and height to 100 always
just make the virtual function return a reference to the data directly you need to change to vector then - not possible with arrays or c style arrays types with different sizes or if pointers are the only feasible option as a pointer range iterators range adapter would be preferred though if possible - more on that to make this last method work with range-based for-loop one way is to make a small range view type that has the functions begin end - essential a pair with begin end example then construct it with it is easy to make it non-template if a template is not desired
to have sth like i have thousands of tables i am thinking of a loop that will somehow put the first set which will be df time i 12 00 or df time i 1 00 and i than a minimum number as am but not sure if there is a more effective solution something that will define that the first range of values is id 1 10 and the 2nd range is 11 22
if weight is more than min less than max then use this row 2 the name if the name is equal to this then use this column i am struggling trying to combine 2 lookup functions to return me a value the example should see that the value sits between 200 and 500 and should look at this row and then it should see that the name is equal to name_c and therefore return me 4.9 any help would be greatly appreciated
interestingly pypy is worse than cpython with __slots__ and stays stable for extreme field counts
for example if you re using gradlew the following can be added to build.gradle
now how can i set width and height of that image if i have used url of css. need your valuable thoughts
for small examples overlays can be submitted in a get request but bigger overlays should be submitted via post request either as application x-www-form-urlencoded or as multipart with one part named overlay_spec
it s a portrait when the the height is greater than or equal to the width

this is also reproducible with gcc not just g++
when your case should use put if you know the id then your best bet is to do why post is meant more strictly for new resource creation
put is used more in situations where you want to create or replace which fits your requirement as closely as you re gonna get in my opinion
simple approach note height should be smaller than the width to allow horizontal padding
i get the error as the remote debugger is older than this versioning of visual studio 2019 upgrade your remote debugger though i m using the latest compatible tools on both sides

the default overscroll behaviour can be overridden by extends the container class and overriding the pointer methods without calling their super methods
so container will run in https right now it s running like .it s should be like process is like 1 push code in github done 2 create docker image done 3 push docker image to aws ecr done 4 pull image from aws ecr and run with kubernetes cluster done 6 work on http protocol on 80 port done 7 bind domain to cluster end point done 8 configure ssl not done anybody have suggestions
this is to make sure that your swift class can be used in objective-c environment as well
a correct answer will depend on what type the key and value parts are if one of them is a for example the equals comparison is trickier but in general assuming that all the keys and values have their equals and gethashcode methods implemented correctly we can use the system.linq extension methods any and except to get the result
when user comes back to your app application class s oncreate will be called and your service s oncreate will also be called to recreate it
with the disclaimer that raw types are best avoided a simple workaround in your case is to use a temporary variable to do the type conversion or to emulate the enhanced for-loop in which case the unchecked type conversion will be permitted in loops head
it s a ratio right so you can check whether your width height is closer to 16 9 or 3 1
i do know that highstock does has support for scrolling but i would like this to be implemented with highcharts using the native scroll
when i tried to do int arrlist.get j .equals current it tells me boolean can t be converted to int
a proposal can be compilation and execution as you can see i name the variable from their behavior making the code more clear contrarily to a b and c the right type for an index is size_t i do not use a literal int but i use sizeof in the for to follow the size of the array even if it is changed i use infinity to initialize min because any valid double is lower that it and -infinity to initialize max because any valid double is greater that it in case of an invalid input on scanf i flush all the line before to redo you can also just read a word if you prefer in the printf you do not need the l because printf cannot receive a float whose are transformed to double but the l is necessary in scanf to read a double
i tried to debug the problem and i think the issue coming from layout of mpi gird not compatible with scalapack since mpi darray using mpi_order_c and scalapack is based on fortran
this will do notice how in a while loops you have to initialise and increment the iterator i yourself which is why a for-loop is more suitable
that is much easier to work with because can be indexed with int and you can easily turn an called chars back into a string with string chars

i read the following instruction in a korn shell script i managed to know that with typeset you can specify the type of variables and that the parameter -i2 describes that the variable is an integer to be interpreted in radix 2 binary . however i still can t understand what the value assigned to the variable 2#0 means
there are several performance analysis tools out there such as perf and gprof profilers
for example if you make it throws fatal error on iphone 5 32-bit arch thread 1 fatal error double value cannot be converted to int because the result would be greater than int.max
when the width divided by the height of the component would be larger than the height divided by the width of the component then a wrong fittingimagesize was returned causing the app to attempt to create a bufferedimage with a width of several million px

here are some strategies for passing data between threads safely an int is atomic at the cpu s instruction set level so you can safely read and write an int or any data type equal to or smaller than an int such as a bool a single chars or a pointer from multiple threads without having any inconsistent state occurring
some bytes of the array can be interpreted as unsigned integer unit32 by numpy.frombuffer
generally the state of certain component could be the props of the child component props will be passed to children which is stated inside the rendering method of the parent component

to check an imei here first you have to enable cookie handling in curl that can be done with curlopt_cookiefile also utf-8 is not a valid transfer-encoding and makes no sense instead do next you have to fetch the page with a normal get request this will give curl the cookie needed to check an imei and give curl the csrf token needed to check an imei after you got the cookie which is handled automatically by curl and the csrf token in the html you need to extract the token from the html that can be done with domdocument and domxpath and finally now that you have both the session cookie and the csrf token you can do the imei lookup request and to get the response from the html one can again use domdocument which yields because 999999999999999 was not a valid imei code
the formula above can be simplified by seeing it as a triangle with base n and height n-1 n n - 1 2 the total weight is can be given by multiplying this by 50 w 50 n n - 1 2 also n must be odd that is its modulo by 2 should be 1 n 2 1 so you have an optimization problem where you want to maximize n

better compression with range constraints adding a self-imposed constraint partitions are sorted from largest to lowest part we can deduce for p in parts num size max constraints 2 3 can be applied recursively to all by noting that is in therefore we can compute better imin imax and inject them in the previous implementation live demo todo sanity checks the provided implementations can go into undefined behaviour if the partition is not sorted or the partition index is not valid
solving int constraints is significantly harder than solving pure boolean constraints and when you use int to model boolean like this the underlying solver simply explores the search space that s just unreachable

in the above i now am taking the whole line initially and if the count is less than or equal to 19 we can easily use a second loop to get set of spaces by using all of the non-space characters we may expect instead as the delimiter instead of spaces
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined
you should call subscribe and pass a function that will get called each time an item is ready

this is evidently what happened in your example since your realloc call asks for less memory than was allocated by calloc and we can see that it didn t do that here since the address of ptr when free is called is the same as the block allocated by calloc
ng20 perplexity i have experimented with scikit-learn gensim and the gensim mallet wrapper and all packages do show different perplexity values which can be expected since lda is randomly initalized + different inference algorithms but the common pattern is that the perplexity does increase for every package which contradicts many papers from the literature
you can also use glue client to do the same thing with batch_create_partition or create_partition methods but this would require different inputs then athena client update 2019-07-03 if your data has structure like s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 27 00 00001.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 27 00 00002.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 27 01 00001.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 27 01 00002.json ... s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 28 00 00001.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 28 00 00002.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 28 01 00001.json s3 my-bucket data 2019 06 28 01 00002.json but you only want to have only 3 partitions year month day then definition of your table should take that into account then ddl statements for adding partitions should be remember that in s3 there is not such thing as folder or directory

in my e-commerce project in admin panel there are forms used to edit information about categories products users etc. i m using context api for my global state. so in my categoryedit component i m using to give fields initial values fetched from database. but then when i m trying to change values in field using common obviously nothing happens because values are not bound from the categoryedit component state . also putting setstate to componentdidmount doesn t work because data in provider is fetched in async way so at first value is empty. i do not want to bind this form value changes to global state because this changes can be canceled and they should be refetched after submission form. so what i want is - to initially fill form using values from provider - then pass them to categoryedit state once - then handle changes of the component state - submit data to database using asyncronous fetch inside categoryedit component - tell provider via action that it can update is this the right pattern to do such things or there s a better way to handle forms in react using context

there are a number of things things that need addressing in your code to get the issues sorted 1 the height and width of your images and iframe should not be defined as width 1179x1179 height 480x480
you can easily add and hold the places you want to have _ chars by using a list of int
i have a div with image using -webkit-mask-image css but i can t set width and height for this -webkit-mask-image like css background image.
if it would return a point outside the bounds of the control either negative x y or x y value being greater than width and height of the control i could easily decide that it was not just left for a control being a visual child but a control in another part of the visual tree

they first find the best solution with fractions values for the variables number of steps then successively divide the allowed region into smaller sections with integer edges and eventually stop when they find the best solution at an edge
since you are using a component with all your property fields can only be read via getter and written via setter
how about this from a programming perspective this isn t as good a solution as the one that uses an object because an object map dictionary is easier to extend to other values
it can be done with checkbox as well but based on your requirement it will always be feasible and more efficient to use the radio button since it by default provides you the functionality of choosing only one option whereas in case of checkbox you will have to write down more code explicitly to provide it the same functionality which in turn increases your codebase and does no good
unless you are using netbeans 11.1 which is currently in beta i would not use this option as gradle support in older versions is not as good as ant or maven support
first the check for greater than 1 can be replaced by min since contentoffset.y could also be negative you might want to prevent negative values using max now if you want to flip the direction simply subtract that value from 1 alternatively do it in one line finally set the color

this is my current approach while true try next it except stopiteration logging.info no more results to process. return except socket.timeout logging.warning encountered timeout. if i retry the same item enough times by rerunning the script manually the timeout will resolve itself so i d like to be able to retry the problematic item programmatically instead of just repeating the search multiple times
the rules for inserting into a min heap add new item to the end of the array while the new item is larger than its parent swap the new item with its parent the rules for removing the top item in the heap the smallest save the top item move the last item in the array to the first position while the item is larger than either of its children swap the item with its smallest child
but here are two ways still involves a for-loop is longer but no for loops this will be a lot more efficient on big arrays

for simple equations that take a single input it s sufficient to supply the function itself or when using an equation rather than a simple function via a formula when using equations that access more than a single variable you need to use rlang quosures instead here quo creates a quosure a quoted representation of your equation same as your use of strings except unlike strings this one is properly scoped is directly usable by dplyr and is conceptually cleaner it is like any other r expression except not yet evaluated

each image will either have its width greater than the height or the height greater than its width
option 1 if the width is greater than the height then i would like the image to be scaled with respect to its height being fixed to device height and width should be scrollable in the view
option 2 if the height is greater than the width then i would like the image to be scaled with respect to its width being fixed to device width and height should be scrollable in the view
i have modified the function to work for option 1 like so now both these functions work fine but in both cases there are some situations where the scaling causes the image to scale smaller than the width or height of the device
case 1 when height is greater than width width 1080.0 height 2280.0 width 1080.0 height 2160.0 width 1083.0 height 1920.0 width 1080.0 height 2160.0 case 2 when width is greater than height width 2715.0 height 1920.0 width 1945.0 height 1920.0 width 2278.0 height 1920.0 here are a few images for whose height and width these function produces the above mentioned problem

my current algorithm is very inefficient and not pretty eg the number is 940 800 generate an array of random single digits excluding 0 that multiplying up to 940 800 if the size is less than 8 add the rest of the space with 1 if the size is greater than 8 try removing the 1s if the size is greater than 8 try to reduce it down by removing double 2 or double 3 if the size is greater than 8 this set of random digits is not possible
uicollectionview has a more advanced caching scheme than uitableview or at least as it used to have which is the reason you see what you do
so you can use cloud scheduler to deploy scheduled cron jobs

not much experience with axios but some googling lead me to a similar question asked in the reactjs subreddit
so it s basically not possible to try to use functions that were written for bash in fish they re as different as bash and csh
we still loop through days but we do all 100 simulations at once by generating an array of random numbers and making use of numpy s element-wise multiplication which is much faster than using a loop you will need to add the following import import numpy as np and then replace your nested loop with this single loop edit to add because you are using a very simple formula which only involves basic multiplication you actually can get rid of both loops by generating a random matrix of numbers using numpy s cumulative product function column-wise and multiplying it by a dataframe where each value begins at 100

use a subquery to collect the count then select from that the trick here is which in mysql is 0 if false and 1 if true so more than 2 children parent will appear after all parent with 2 or less and within each bracket of results parent are sorted by description
the documentation in chart.js is more detailed how to label y axis using ng2-charts in chart.js y-axis s ticks are determined automatically based on the data you have pushed into chartdatasets e.g
for example assuming events exist which eventaction equal test1 or test2 or test3 i want to use combined union grouping test1 or test2 or test3 as a dimension filtering

if you allocate memory with malloc it must be deallocated with free
it has nothing in common with selenium you need to get a snapshot of what s going on with your operating system when you launch the browser for example using windows performance monitor blind shot chrome browser is very memory intensive you can check how much ram it consumes using windows task manager and if your machine is short on ram it starts intensively using page file to store some memory pages to disk and since disk is much slower comparing to the ram - you re getting inconsistent results
the following code is for making the same y axis limit on two subplots just a reminder the histogram auto crops the range if the specified range is larger than the max min of the data points

why doesn t double print the entire number in second code- why is int more precise than double in that case
when i rewrite left join by subquery it took only 111ms attached plans while googling i have found this blog post in most cases joins are also a better solution than subqueries postgresql will even internally rewrite a subquery creating a join whenever possible but this of course increases the time it takes to come up with the query plan many so question like this a left outer join can be faster than an equivalent subquery because the server might be able to optimize it better a fact that is not specific to mysql server alone
it also makes little sens to check both for an id to be greater than minimum less than maximum and within that range
be warned that crypt is to be removed from mysql from 8.0.3 and they have no salt versions so you need to roll your own salt and sha2 if you want to make a save password in a trigger
quicksorta performs marginally better than mergesort for large datasets on my system but performance will depend on the actual implementation of quicksort which does not necessarily use a quicksort algorithm

play-slick can be used to implements compile-time dependency injection via macwire by extends slickcomponents if you re using compile-time di you can query the database config directly from the slickapi using the slickapi.dbconfig dbname name method
there is no boolean type so gender will be stored as int
so i called a mediaquery to get the screen size and base the widget off that margin just slightly less than the width of whichever screen it is on to make the value responsive
there are client-server databases that you can use locally such as mysql faircom sql server postgresql and many others
we have found that in machines in which srilm tests fail the accuracy of kaldi is variable wer differ between two identical executions
so you need to pass that into the function here count_bits_in_byte is a standard bit-counting function for a single byte using naive counting or a lookup table or some variation thereof using chars might be ok but unsigned chars is less trouble since unsigned types have well-defined int overflow semantics
it treats boolean types as numbers which will be converted to int and strings
in addition the for-loop itself is taking much more time than the multiplication or the division ops
settingsfragment extends preferencefragmentcompat and is in the xml of settingsactivity which is launched from mainactivity like this i do not have onbackpressed implements in settingsactivity
comparing int to int is slightly faster than comparing strings especially if the string has a chars set other than binary but this is premature optimization
this explains why you are not seeing multiplication as faster than division when timing with instead let s write setup code which performs multiplication and division on random numbers yields on my machine multiplying is faster 99.00 of the time
however i know numpy is not compatible with ironpython since it s written in cpython
so the solution that worked for me to match the clients requirement was to scale the image always by the height of the image regardless of whether the height or width is greater than the other
1.using bcm gpio instead of wiringpi pin because controlling more than one servo you might need more than one pin such like 1 wiringpi pin 18 bcm gpio for another servo for rpi3 b+ version it give access to two channels for hardware pwm
there are some minor differences like ability to have 2 versions of the same method in subclassing like methoda and super.methoda or that instance of subclassing can be treated as subclassing and superclass polimorphism
we recommend using dplyr for data frames or purrr for lists instead
also bcopy and bzero are deprecated in posix and should be replaced by memcpy and memset
given that the dialog is complex i feel like popupwindow is more appropriate then popupmenu
cassandra-8303 was raised to add a capability limitation framework that would allow allow filtering to be disabled for grouping of users but it is still marked as open
in java you can tell the compiler what kind of numbers do you have if you look at the signatures you have public static void foo int i long s public static void foo long i int d you have an overload of the method that s ok but now when you use the methods you have diferent types as arguments of foo you can do this in several ways or just foo 10 100l the l means your number is of type long the same can be done with 10.02f meaning float or 10.05d meaning double is better to use capitalized letter so the is no missunderstanding between 1l looks like eleven and 1l 1 long

actually in the documentation it s stated that if the action called in the method takes too long ticks can be skiped but i dont think that these calculations take longer than 60 min which is the max time usable
i have found that using directoryentry directly is always faster than using userprincipal groupprincipal so that s what my examples use here is the method to use that from your code you would do this that method just returns the name of the group but you can modify it as you need
with the introduction of inline variables static constexpr member variables no longer need to be defined outside of the class
this will hide any children that would overflow an elements height when less than its children 1 the reason the bg color is in between is because you set the background color of the parent element

in the book introduction to algorithms there is a line under the heading analysis of insertion sort that reads when a for or while loops exits in the usual way due to the test in loops header the test is executed one time more than loops body. the for-loop as far as i understand uses a counter for the iterating variable
i m trying to parse a rdd seq string to dataframe. although it s a seq of strings they could have a more specific type as int boolean double string an so on. for example a line could be hello 1 bye 1.1 hello1 11 bye1 2.1 ... another execution could have a different number of columns
while debugging i have confirmed that the onpost handler is being called and the modelstate is reflecting the new changed values correctly - it just seems to lose the dbcontext which i thought was meant to be maintained across get and post calls in .net core

if i compare the packets captured by the two the number of packets captured by the net pcap is less meaning that some packets are not captured or missed by the net pcap whereas i am pretty sure omnipeek captures them all
the height is considerably less than the width hence the difference in movement distance between the two forms of translate
if the element s width is more than it s height then it moves less as compared to transform translatex 50
the reason is that when you add a library manually via intellij only intellij knows about them and when you compile your code using maven it can t be find by maven because maven only searches for dependencies you defined in pom.xml
if i edit the son page and the son has a grandson than i shouldn t be allowed to select dad as parent for the son since it would create a nest that is to deep in the folllowing case when i m editing the son record i shouldn t be able to select dad as it s parent since the son has children
call this function for all 3 textboxes like this and if the value is not empty and can be parsed as int double keep doing the sum and finally store the value in the text property of our highlighted textbox. hint you might also want to save the formula on the highlighted textbox because this value goes into the text property you can use the tag property to hold the formula

for example chars data type can be converted to int unambiguously and int itself can be used as a condition for switch but string would be too ambiguous to be changed to int that is why the error message pops up
if you don t want to send data in clear text through the network then using ssl https is the better option
while mutating c min max is the better option for this case if you want to avoid that you can do something like this
then if its type matches the exception-handling named after the except keyword the except clause is executed then the program skips the rest of the try clause and continues after the except clause if an exception-handling occurs which does not match the exception-handling named in the except clause the exception-handling is thrown and can be caught by try-catch clauses wrapping around the current one using this information we can solve your problem
it looks like azure search now supports both a get and post method and recommends using post when the length of the url would exceed the max limit of 2048 characters 1024 for just the querystring
the udp drop ratio is very small less than 0.001 except when starting the udp multicast in the middle of the day in which case all previously sent udp packets from 1 to some n will need to be resent on tcp while live transmission of udp multicast data packets number n+1 onward is being received. i can t request sender stock exchange to change its protocol--it is fixed
if x is of an unsigned integer type that is at least as large as unsigned int and y is less than the number of bits in x s type then the above partial statement will test whether bits in x that aren t in the top y are set
the c99 and later standards however wouldn t require that implementations usefully process any situation in which x is non-zero but the expression would yield zero unless x is an unsigned integer type at least as large as unsigned int
but if you had to choose between an actual fp multiple or fp add instruction normally subtraction has latency at least as good as multiplication
intel haswell and broadwell have multiplying throughput twice as good as add throughput running on fma units with worse or equal latency to add but most microarchitectures including modern x86 ryzen and skylake have balanced fp add vs
in general for non-x86 architectures generally add will be at least as cheap as multiplying
if you must use try-catch block you will need to throw an exception-handling from try block with an appropriate message whenever an even number is encountered and handle the exception-handling in a catch block accordingly as this can also be achieved without try-catch as

signed chars or signed short can be converted to int
unsigned chars char8_t since c++20 or unsigned short can be converted to int if it can hold its entire value range and unsigned int otherwise

i can t work with int or double and use numberformatter because input could be more than int or double max values
if that still doesn t give you enough accuracy you can try to increase the precision. however the main issue with doing this in numpy is that the lapack functions under the hood are compiled for float64. thus even if the numpy function allows inputs of higher precision float128 it will round them before calling the lapack functions. it might be possible to recompile those functions for higher precision but that may not be worth the effort for your particular problem. as a side note i m not very familiar with scipy so it may be the case that they have eigensolvers written in python which support all different types but you need to be careful that they are actually doing every step in the higher precision and not silently rounding to float64 somewhere. for your problem i would suggest using the package mpmath which supports arbitrary precision linear algebra. it is a bit slower since everything is done in software but for 14x14 matrices it should still be pretty quick

this is where a while loops is useful rather than use a for-loop with a range use a while loops with a decrement counter the current value can then be modified during loops eg a while loops will continue to loops until the condition is true in python an integer is considered true if it is non-zero allowing this to work
with winforms you could achieve this like when click next you hide your current form let it be forma and show the other form let it be formb at forma s position
in both cases signed or unsigned implicit int promotion will occur this is mandated by the standard and the calculation will be done in int anyway unless unsigned chars and signed int happened to have the same size then unsigned int instead
if type chars is smaller than int this multiplication cannot overflow but the result should be stored into an int to avoid the implementation defined conversion in case the value exceeds the range of chars such as would be the case if chars is unsigned
these functions use an opaque non-numeric type fpos_t rather than long which makes them both more and less flexible than fseek and ftell

i wrote simple sin function predictors using keras and tensorflow with lstm but found the performance of keras code is much slower which runs about 5 min while tensorflow code runs the model just in 20 seconds
because width 100 plus margin 16px is more than 100
explanation while to_vertex is in the same place as before in your min heap you might have changed its key enough to be smaller than its parent or larger than any of its children
if that succeeds requires that the user be permitted to sudo rootsh without providing a passwd then deliver the rest of the commands by communicating with the subprocess
i am more familiar with dplyr and purrr and used them to implement it below
but you should use proc_open instead so you can inspect both stdout and stderr the other answers here only allows you to inspect stdout which is not very helpful in detecting errors if an error occurs the error will most likely be printed in stderr php prints errors to stderr by default not stdout.
i ve been looking for good examples of how to implement binary classification in tensorflow in a similar manner to the way it would be done in keras
your image component is actual vertically bottom set backgroundcolor and you ll see it but as the actual image not image component will resize to fit the image componenti. in this case because of width is bigger height so the image will verticaly center inside image component you need either set resizemode cover or change abosolute property top bottom
attempt 1 check whether adding or subtract is better with one bit of information start x1 add x+1 0 divide x+1 2 operations subtract x0 divide x 2 operations we reach an impass if x or x+1 were even the optimal move would be to divide
attempt 2 check whether adding or subtract is better with two bits of information start x01 add x10 divide x1 add x+1 0 divide x+1 4 operations subtract x0 divide x 4 operations subtract x00 divide x0 divide x 3 operations add x+1 possibly not optimal 4 operations conclusion for x01 subtract will result in at least as few operations as adding 3 and 4 operations versus 4 and 4 operations to reach x and x+1
you can use only enums witch can be represented in objective-c enums without nested enums enums without parameters enums raw types should be integer therefore you can only create another enum witch can be represented in objective-c and just add method to convert to it and create somewhere swift method to another side
have put the min max and output values outside of loop as there is no reason to re-set it each time. you could also break out from loop in the else block where you program is happy with inserted value

as i am not familiar with django or flask
however i don t know if use a std ostringstream is better than std string append so as you can see i used std sregex_iterator instead of std sregex_token_iterator
is a single chars which will be promoted to int to perform binary operation
seems that union is slightly less efficient than distinct . an array constructor is faster than array_agg
this is how it can be done in behat with mink #behat #mink
therefore i think if internally there are some calculation corresponding to range.data.input it needs to be set as min max for each row but the setting for this is actually not min and max for each row
this is better than malloc free at least because new will automatically call a constructor and delete will call a destructor
i ve set two exceptions to be handled inputmismatchexception and arithmeticexception for division by zero
when it was class methods i used objective-c in front of my swift methods but currently with the extensions i have no objective-c or nonobjc when i put objective-c in front of the extension declaration i got method cannot be in an objective-c extension of a class without nonobjc because core foundation types are not classes in objective-c and if i tried objective-c in front of individual methods i got method cannot be marked objective-c because core foundation types are not classes in objective-c my swift code my objective-c and the method is not showing up with autocomplete so i m guessing i m screwing up the syntax in my objective-c code or i need some different extension version of objective-c in my swift code
i am using swift 5 and not so good with objective-c so swift code suggestions would be fantastic
secondly you re passing a wrong format argument to printf which should be f for double values - d is used for int
simd-integer multiplying throughput and latency are both worse than simd-integer add
maximum gap will be minimum when all the elements are equally spaced apart between min and max
note with less than 10 fractions digits rounding may change the integer portion
here is another possible approach using purrr s flatten_dfr nb here i used base r s transform which could be replaced by dplyr s mutate
i see with timer readint in loops 2nd for-loop is taking more time as the input increases..

scrapy uses lxml for parsing which is extremely fast than beautifulsoup
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars ab or containing a chars or escape sequence that does not map to a single-byte execution chars is implementation-defined
i know that can be accomplished with elasticsearch not sure if kibana could be included that way as well - especially without it being too bulky
using imagemagick and mogrify i want to resize the image to 512px -- if width is smaller then that is 512 if height is smaller than that is 512 crop the wider dimension to 512 to make a 512x512 square any help appreciated having a heck of a time understanding the imagemagick docs
as a tip googling the functions will often get you the description and clarification on functions quicker than a post here and will have a lot more information
at least the part of it that directly interacts with swift code should be made objective-c
if i check more than one checkbox and click the add button the checked item is not added into the table
use this in the list the numeric values are noted as int s as the chars would be recognized as int first it would convert them to string and then it would be checked for the chars
edit alphabeta is called about 6 times more than min and max combined while the number of beta cutoffs is only about 2 times more
more generally .elements .nodes .edges can be used to get a collection of graph elements which can be used to show hide select deselect and fit-to
so i have this code basically it seems displaymetrics differs for portrait and landscape while i cannot get from portrait information how it will be modified in landscape
however same has to be done on tablet screens but since tablet does not have cursor i don t have any access to lng lat data while dragging the item
you re getting that error because you re trying to multiplying a timestamp by 1440 rather than the difference between the date and timestamp - multiplication has higher precedence than subtraction
for some unknown reason having more than 2 children for a parent component does not work
in prometheus the service that exports metrics provides an endpoint that can be scraped pull metrics
a long way to grab field1 would be doing normal python for-loop and getting them but i am expecting more than 500 instances of data and things get slower with a loops
because multiplication shall be evaluated before addition
because multiplication shall be evaluated before addition
also i recommend using setter and getter and making your class variables private rather than making them public
you can even put your build dependencies into devdependencies and they will be installed before prepare is execute
i continued using comparisons to get the correct solution and adjusted the exceptions to take the mid to be a value which is either repeated three times or twice if it s not less than max or greater than min
as long as you don t need it s width to ever be shorter than the width of a single space -- uitextfields sizes are calculated using the placeholder property by default -- then this will always have the height of a non-empty uitextfield regardless of whether it contains text or not
as i want to stay with a public and a private key only i came up with the idea to use a hard-coded aes key which will be encoded with rsa public key and than use this to encode the data
the following code should simulate sparse sampling by taking a observation every 4 hours from the sample data set and the second portion should add rows with there respective x values every 0.1 of an hour which will later be filled with interpolation values derived from a cubic splines
you can at the moment only directconnect with google-chrome and firefox. see docs here directconnect basically means you don t need a selenium server to execute the browser commands for you. however if you need to lets say run your tests against internet explorer edge safari you ll need a selenium server for that
i want to encrypt and store a token which is longer than what rsa permits but i can t use aes because if i want to secure it with biometrics then i have to ask for user authentication even when i am encrypting the value and not only when decrypting it as with rsa
it could possibly be that we didn t build our jks keystore truststores correctly more on how we built these files below
it s currently located in content common user_agent.cc it used to be located in webkit glue user_agent.cc but was moved around when google forked it to make blink
it seems that python doc didn t say may be this claim is incorrect please fix it if needed list comprehensions is faster than for-loop here are 2 functions the performance of function v1 for-loop approach timeit find_base_match_v1 d grid 10.6 ns 0.419 ns per loops mean std
boolean can be treated as int sic etc
if you want to get a single value from the query it s better to use the value function or even better with an aggregate-functions like sum the error you have is because you are trying to sum two standard objects the get function returns an array of standard objects you can also solve using this line with your own queries
i prefer using settimeout and call it each time when needed that way you don t need a global variable to maintain the value returned by setinterval
scroll happens when you try fill in a box more than its width or height so you can simply hidden the vertical horizontal scroll or set parent height to auto
while trying to answer c++ bare getter setter with dispatch i thought of the following solution to create a class that implements getter setter like behavior while avoiding any macros which could then be used to create member variables that can have custom getter and or setter functions like so the above code compiles without any problem but as soon as i try to use it i get an error that there is no viable candidate function when trying to assign to such a property variable the output from clang++ is the error message suggests that is never considered
this will be used to filtering out unrelated rows remove rows which are not with concern final step now for df_1 grouping by trip-id and d2 find the min and max of f.struct timestamp speed which will return the first and last records in the grouping select the corresponding fields from the struct to get the final result note remove the intermediate dataframe df_1 we can have the following
besides i ve got that cronjob that deletes everything in tmp that s more than 31622400 seconds old every night so stray temp files can t eat my whole system.
if the value of the tree is less than the min and greater than the max we return false as it is not a valid bst condition
the first if statement is saying if the value of the tree node is less than the min or more than the max then you are not a valid bst and the second statement is saying if your value is within the range of min and max you are a valid bst
as pow returns a double which has a much larger range than either int or long long int you could have
however it seems 900 mb on safari it takes less memory in other browsers like google-chrome
flask is a simple micro framework whereas django is a more advanced mvc like framework
or do we need to test somehow if in some devices the height can be larger than the width
note how it lists the where columns first on the assumption that filtering is more important than grouping index active deletedon -- in either order updatedon tacking on frame_id id in either order but at the end would turn it into a covering index thereby gaining a little more speed
it appears that this is not the case for your buttons the width is larger than the height
there are many different ways to do this but i would recommend using node.js + express for middleware and mongodb for your database
if your pages are generated dynamically server-side the page itself won t be cached client-side therefore your svgs aren t cached either and have to be loaded each time
note on requirement for a specific scenario i need vertical margins w.r.to container parent element height instead of width which is browser s actual behavior
i have a pandas series with the following string values for simplicity i have chosen to display it as a list i want to remove the duplicated words here but to do that i need to remove the punctuation first now i can remove duplicated words this is the result i have now this is ok my problem now is that i need to keep the punctuation but i haven t seen any way of removing duplicated words without stripping out the punctuation characters in the strings
the issue with apple is the video format which can be streamed are not supported by other browsers m3u8 format which cannot be viewed in google-chrome mozilla only works in safari browsers
type aliases don t create a new name for instance error messages won t use the alias name.in older versions of typescript type aliases couldn t be extended or implements from nor could they extends implements other types
i have a html 5 video tag within a bootstrap framework and the positioning seems to be ok in firefox google-chrome safari
suppose your width 500 is greater than height than call method you use this class for resize bitmap
if you are not using a dependency management tool i would recommend using maven gradle or if you are using ant
you can use a regular expression to accomplish this as well you will need to have added a vba reference to microsoft vbscript regular expressions x.x
column types in the database are inferred from the property types you used number will be converted into int string into varchar boolean into bool etc
you are not doing anything incorrect in your statement but as 0 is the chars representation of the nul chars it s somewhat inconvenient strange or imprecise to compare a pointer value with a chars literal and suggests you are interpreting the not as a pointer but more as an int or chars value. but i repeat it s something perfectly legal in c language
i know that class variables need that definition but php states that defining visiblity for methods is optional class methods may be defined as public private or protected
note that vba will not honor this flag because members cannot be hidden in vba user code should work fine in vb6 though
and finally if you are beginning with docker etc i recommend to use mod-php with apache which is easier to setup than php-fpm with nginx considering php-fpm with apache makes no sense
this is the code for when i click the race button this is the method that subtract or adds the bet amount this class calls the method i want the cash labels to be updated and subtract or add the bet amount depending on the outcome of the race
i want to stretch it to a minimum width that s wider than the actual screen so that the height of the video fills a certain amount of it ideally around 90 of the height of the page
to keep things simple let s first define a helper function which can be used to grouping single-key objects by key next we ll use inputs with the -n command line option don t forget -n . if the ordering of the keys is important then simply use this filtering def sort_by_keys to_entries | sort_by .key|tonumber | from_entries
and with the smtpclient the msdn documentation says that one of the following four exceptions can be thrown argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception objectdisposedexception smtpexception so you should do it like this the reason for this is much better logging if you know the exception that was thrown the log could display something like argumentnullexception was thrown insert a possible explanation as to why or if you want to handle all exceptions the same way
interestingly when i log into the server i see that rvm has installed ruby 2.4.1 after taking a closer look at mina s output i see warning the running version of bundler is older than the version that created the lockfile
i am working with angular8 drag and drop and come across some problem what is my concept and what i am doing truck in which i drag and drop deliveries deliveries in which i drag and drop packages this are working fine i am using following json data structute shown below which is get updated with moveiteminarray and transferarrayitem function everything works fine but i need some extra things to be applied with drag and drop that is i want a package to be directly dropped inside truck...so when a package is directly dropped into the truck i want to add a delivery object in that truck deliveries and then inside that delivery i want to assign the drop package i want delivery to be directly dropped inside the delivery...so when delivery is directly dropped i want to move all package of previous delivery packages to current delivery i have tried a lot with different things but drag and drop get disturbed and miss behaves below are my ts and html template code
in order to deploy applications using azure basically you need to follow these steps create a project and repository in azure push your mulesoft code to the repo your project should be based on maven and should contain a pom.xml and settings file pom.xml contains all dependencies and repositories where the dependencies would be pulled settings.xml will allow to define the server credentials and repos to authenticate
a parent can have more than one children making it a 1 n relationship
also by using statsmodel s as_pandas true your code becomes a bit shorter anyways if you want to plot the month as hue i recommend using seaborn over matplotlib this gives
you will need to get the client application to generate an sslkeylogfile which can be done with google-chrome firefox and curl
when reading the performance on dask is significantly poorer than pandas
generally speaking fixed section should be set with width height and top bottom properties otherwise it won t recognise its size and position
outro you can find a couple of relevant discussion in webdriver takescreenshot generates error when web page has a big height webdriver takescreenshot fails in canvas scale for huge web pages exception ns_error_failure in ctx.scale if width or height is greater than 32767 event.synthesizemouseatpoint should only call nsidomwindowutils.sendmouseevent if there is a valid window handle
the value sent with the _method field will be used as the http request method so override post with put like below
however due to the difference in width and height i m getting a weird effect because each side takes equal time but as the width is much larger than the height it looks like it goes much faster
let s assume that i have code like this as far as i know division is heavier than multiplication so as an the optimization i changed the code as follows however since value is an integer i have to cast it but as far as i know a type cast is also considered a heavy action
if the height is less than 660 and the width is less than 375 we have a portrait se or 5s

it s true that mercurial s hgignore is much more flexible than git s gitignore becuase mercurial supports regular expressions and glob syntax
note that it s also possible to create aes keys that require authentication when decrypting but not when encrypting which is rather cool aes is much much faster than rsa
failing that try logging out and in again. in my version of pycharm i check that path is correct by going to the preferences finding the settings build execution deployment console python console looking for a text field called environment variables of which path is one clicking on a ... button just to the right of the text field to see details making sure include parent environment variables is checked and then clicking on a show link next to that checkbox to have pycharm pop-up a dialog with all of the environment variables it s passing along when it runs python console operations
you can use an implicit loop by providing a function to prop which will be executed against each element in turn
